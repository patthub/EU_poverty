        "Foreword Among the main challenges facing the European Union, boosting growth and employment and re- connecting with citizens are at the top of the agenda. Consumer policy is ideally placed to advance both these objectives, since its role is to directly enhance the everyday lives of European citizens. From improving price labels in the local supermarket, to strengthening the rights of holidaymakers, EU consumer policy has a direct, grass-root impact. European consumer policy received a boost in January 2007, when the EU recognised its vital importance as a bridge between citizens, the economy and government and appointed the first ever European Commissioner exclusively responsible for Consumer affairs. Since then, an ambitious work programme has been launched that strives both to strengthen consumers' rights and options, and to empower them to make the right decisions and be frontline actors of economic life. To make this a reality, it is vital that not only policy-makers, but also businesses and consumers themselves, have access to reliable data, in order to make sound decisions. Consumers, in particular, can be bombarded with a barrage of information about their rights, obligations and purchasing choices, and it can be difficult to see the bigger picture or to separate the wheat from the chaff. Consumption is where citizens meet the market - hence it is important that we can evaluate our lives as consumers and compare our situation with that of our neighbours. Statistics are vital decision making tools. We cannot properly assess our options or decide how to act without access to information that is as objective as possible. The facts and figures provided by this publication can serve as a guide to European citizens as they negotiate the market and make complex consumer choices. This third edition of Consumers in Europe - Facts and Figures focuses on \"the network industries providing services of general interest\". These are utilities such as water, transport, electricity, telecommunications and postal services which play a fundamental role in the economic and social lives of citizens and have a special place in European societies. As little as 20 years ago, the majority of these services were organised through State-controlled monopolies. Now that network infrastructure (rail tracks, telephone cables and pipelines etc) can be separated from services to clients, competitive market conditions are becoming a reality. Consumers therefore, have more choice. The liberalisation of such vital services has been accompanied by rules which ensure that consumers' interests are fully reflected. In particular, Community legislation defined the notion of public service obligation or Universal Service Obligation, to ensure that the permanent provision of a range of services easily accessible to users is guaranteed, allowing consumers to reap the full benefits of a competitive market. Moreover, 2007 is an important milestone in building an efficient and sustainable EU energy policy. Most Member States should have finalised the opening-up of the energy consumer market to competition, which will result in consumers having a choice among a range of suppliers. To mark this momentous year, this document provides key data for appraising market liberalisation in Europe and its consequences for consumers. It allows the reader to compare and contrast the situation between one service and another, and between one EU country and another. We have a special responsibility to make clear and transparent data available to everyone, and sincerely hope that this third edition of Consumers in Europe will contribute to the goal of empowering Europe's consumers.

        "1. Consumers and network industries providing services of general economic interest 2 (cid:4) This report focuses on the services of general economic interest that are provided by the four big network industries, i.e. transport, energy, telecommunication and postal services. It also includes data on other services such as water and banking. At the heart of every policy on services of general interest lies the wellbeing of citizens. Services of general interest make an important contribution to the overall competitiveness of European industry and to economic, social and territorial cohesion. As users of these services, European citizens have come to expect high quality services at affordable prices. It is thus users and their requirements that are the main focus of public action in this domain. The EU protects the objectives of general interest and the mission of serving the public. Services of general economic interest can be defined as collective or social goods in the sense that they are different from ordinary services and public authorities may consider that they need to be provided even where the market may not have sufficient incentives to do so. This is not to deny that in many cases the market will be the best mechanism for providing such services. However, even though many basic requirements, such as food, clothing and shelter, are provided exclusively or overwhelmingly by the market, if the public authorities consider that certain services are in the general interest and market forces may not result in a satisfactory provision, they can lay down a number of specific obligations for the provider. The fulfilment of these obligations may trigger, albeit not necessarily, the granting of special or exclusive rights, or the provision for specific funding mechanisms. The classic case is the universal service obligation, i.e., the obligation to provide a certain service throughout the territory at affordable tariffs and on similar quality conditions, irrespective of the profitability of individual operations. These services are primarily supplied to households. The above mentioned service obligation plays an important role in sparsely populated and rural areas. Noticeable differences can be observed between the Member States (Table 1.1): for instance whereas in Greece, Malta and the Netherlands, over 60% of all households are located in densely populated areas, we find 24% in the Czech Republic, 20% in Slovenia and only 2% in France falling in this category. Half, or more than half of all Baltic States' households, are located in sparsely populated areas. Values between 40% and 50% are also registered in France, Hungary and Slovenia.

        "1. Consumers and network industries providing services of general economic interest (cid:4) 3 At this point a more detailed look at the characteristics of the households is useful, these services can be either supplied to the benefit of all household members (electricity, gas, fixed telephony) or to individuals (mobile telephony in many cases). Household size: a span between an average 2.1 and 3.1 persons At EU level, the private household size amounted to an average 2.4 persons (Figure 1.2). The smallest household size was registered in Germany (2.1), Denmark (2.2) and Finland (2.2). Households were clearly larger in Ireland, Cyprus and Poland (3.0 persons in all three countries) but especially in Malta and Slovakia (both countries 3.1 persons). The majority of the households are composed of two adults with dependent children, in fact 35% of all households at EU-level fell in this category in 2005 (see Table 1.3). Particularly high shares are noted in Luxembourg (44%) and France (42%) whereas low values are noted in Latvia (27%) but also in Bulgaria and Croatia (29%). The second most frequent type of household, representing a quarter of all households at EU level, is composed of two adults without dependent children. Here, Finland (31%) and Germany (30%) top the list. Conversely, Slovakia and Malta only registered a share of 14% and 15% respectively. Households with single adults represent 17% of all households in Germany and Finland, against only 12% at EU level. With a share of 8%, i.e., double the EU average, the United Kingdom stands out in the category 'single parent with dependent children'. Finally, households with three or more adults with dependent children, often the typical three-generation households, are quite widespread in Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Romania, where they represent between 25% and 30% of all households, against only 11% at the level of the EU.

        "1. Consumers and network industries providing services of general economic interest 6 (cid:4) Housing and Utilities' costs a fast increasing burden in Ireland, Poland and Slovakia On average, more than one fifth (21.7%) of the total household consumption expenditure in 2005 was spent on housing and utility bills (see Table 1.4). Compared to 1995, this share has experienced only a moderate increase. More interesting are the differences between the various Member States. Indeed, the proportion ranged between 8.5% and 28.3% in 2005. Malta, Cyprus and Lithuania were at the lower end of the scale with 8.5%, 12.7% and 13.8% respectively whereas households in Poland spent 26.4% and those in Sweden 28.3% of their total household expenditure. Looking at the development over time, housing, electricity, gas and other fuels became less of a burden in Estonia, Greece and Lithuania whereas its weight in a household's budget noticeably increased in Ireland, Poland and Slovakia. In times of raising energy prices, utility bills can make up a substantial part of this expenditure, especially in Nordic countries with climatic conditions that drive up heating bills but also in Southern countries with high electricity consumption for the operation of air conditioning equipment. It can reasonably be stated that increasing energy prices are largely responsible for the higher share in consumption expenditure in 2005 compared to a year earlier. It is hoped that the situation will not deteriorate further, such that households have difficulties in paying utility bills. More than a fifth of Greek and Polish households in arrears of utility bills The EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), carried out in 2005 has also addressed this point. Figure 1.5 displays the percentage of households in 2005 that have been in arrears on utility bills in the last 12 months. It appears that more than a quarter (27.3%) of Greek households were in such a situation; a high proportion compared to Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, the countries which follow, with proportions between 21% and 18%. Conversely, the lowest proportions were registered in Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands (all countries around 3%) and particularly Austria (under 2%).

Figure 1.6 offers an insight on the type of location of these households. There is no such thing as a clear pattern although households in arrears on utility bills appear to be located primarily in densely populated areas (see also Table 1.1). There are nevertheless some noticeable differences. In Estonia, Greece and Slovakia, households located in thinly populated areas are primarily concerned, whereas this is the case for households in intermediate areas in Latvia, Hungary and Poland. One would expect a correlation between the proportion of households in arrears on utility bills and their size. This is generally confirmed in Figure 1.7, which shows that the proportion of households with 5 persons in such a situation is the highest in most countries for which data are available. Surprisingly, the Greek proportions are nearly identical, irrespective of the three categories shown, indicating that the location is the predominant factor here.

        "1. Consumers and network industries providing services of general economic interest 8 (cid:4) The following chapters offer a more in-depth view of services of general interest and how their access, price and quality are perceived. At this stage, it seems appropriate to show a selection of summary tables allowing a comparison of the individual services at EU-25 level. Information is taken from a recent Eurobarometer Survey (2006) where citizens in the individual Member States were questioned on their opinions on services of general interest. Electricity and water supply are the services to which most of the EU-25 citizens had easy access (93% of those polled). At the other end of the scale, access to broadband Internet was easy for only 60%, often explained by the lack of infrastructures in rural areas (Table 1.8). Internet access (be it through dial-up or broadband) also scored the highest proportions in the 'do not know' category, as not all the persons polled are actually aware of the available offers. Hard facts and subjective perceptions Amongst the consumers polled, 15% stated that they had no access to gas supply networks. Here also, the lack of infrastructure, especially in rural areas is presumably the reason. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that in countries such as Sweden and Finland, the gas supply to households is very limited (only in certain larger urban areas), while in Cyprus and Malta there is no system of gas supply through pipelines. Access to the rail network was perceived as easy by slightly less than three-quarters of the EU population. The availability of a rail network is generally highest in densely populated areas but the subjective component also plays its part. Indeed, citizens in the higher age groups perceive access to transport networks generally as less easy then the young.

(4 ) Bus, tram, underground, etc. Table 1.10 describes the answer regarding affordability among those that didn't use these particular services. Here, the relatively high percentage of 'do not know' answers suggests that the non use is due for other reasons. This would be acceptable if it was due for lack of interest or need in the particular service, however it would be worrying if it is due to reasons of, say accessibility. It is important that services of general interest are available to all European citizens. Among those who were aware of the price levels of the various services, the highest proportions of respondents who answered that the prices were 'not affordable' were found for electricity services (27%) and fixed telephone services (26%). Moreover, the percentage of respondents who stated that the price for these services was excessive, was 12% and 15% respectively. 65% of the respondents that did not use the service thought the price of postal services to be affordable, ahead of transport services between towns/cities (54%) and water supply services (51%).

(2 ) Gas supply through pipelines. Turning back to those who effectively used the respective service (Table 1.11), EU-25 citizens are well aware of the price levels as the 'do not know' percentages are very small (except for dial-up/broadband Internet access, where 4% were not aware of the price they were paying for this service). Possibly linked to the fact that considerable energy price increases (essentially in 2005) were still fresh in the minds of the respondents, electricity and gas supply services were considered to be affordable by only 66% and 65% of the EU-25 respondents respectively, the lowest score among the various services considered. Between 31% and 33% even considered the price to be either not affordable or even excessive. Conversely, 87% of all citizens polled considered postal services to be affordable, the highest share before the price to maintain a current bank account (82%) and that of dial-up/broadband Internet access (80%). Most complaints in communication services The recent Eurobarometer survey on consumers' opinions of services of general interest also investigated whether complaints on aspects linked to services of general interest were made. Here, it appears that the communication domain generates the most complaints: 13% of all EU-25 respondents mentioned that they filed a complaint linked to services linked to dial-up/broadband Internet services. The percentage for mobile and fixed telephone services was only slightly lower, with 12% and 11% respectively. For all other services, the share of citizens that made a complaint was of 6% or less. Water supply services generated the least complaints with 3%.

        "1. Consumers and network industries providing services of general economic interest (cid:4) 11 Price level often highest in Denmark Table 1.13 should be considered as general background information for the entire publication. It gives an overview of the price levels of the various consumption categories in 2005 compared to the average price level at EU-25 level. Categories of special interest in the framework of this publication carry a grey background. As an example, the price level for 'Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels' stands in Denmark stood 51% over the EU-25 average whereas it only amounted to 35 index points in Lithuania, i.e. 65% under the EU-25 average. Price levels in Spain and Austria corresponded to the EU-25 average. In the category transport, which includes personal transport equipment, the price level of Denmark stood 50% over, that of Latvia 37% under the EU-25 average. In most categories, Denmark displays the highest price levels, but not in communications: here, it is Ireland that recorded a level 16% over the EU-25 average whereas Cyprus scored low with 46 index points, i.e. 54% under the EU-25 average. Nevertheless, price differences in 'Communications' appeared less strong than in 'Transport' and especially 'Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels'.

        "1. Consumers and network industries providing services of general economic interest 12 (cid:4) Linked to the price levels in the individual countries are the VAT rates applied. The various rates relating to services of general interest are detailed in Table 1.14. Whereas certain Member States largely apply the standard VAT rates to products and services in the scope of services of general interest, others, charge specific rates. The range of rates applied in the various countries can be quite large. Furthermore, and this is not reflected in the information given in Table 1.14, certain products are subject to other excise taxes or duties, especially energy products.

        "2. Transport Services 14 (cid:4) The end of the 20 th century has seen an explosion in demand for certain transport services. The transport services covered in this chapter include passenger transport by rail, road, air, sea and inland waterway, as well as combined passenger transport and a miscellaneous group of other purchased transport services. Regarding these services, a vast array of generally everyday facts is presented. Air transport growing fastest Total passenger transport demand keeps on growing: in 1995, 5 034 billion passenger-kilometres were performed by the various transport modes. Five years later, this figure stood at over 5 600 billion and in 2003 at 5 828 billion (see Figure 2.1). Since 1995, relative growth of air transport has been particularly strong.

More than three quarters of this distance were covered by car. The car is by far the most widely-used mode of transport in every Member State (see Table 2.2) and its use has expanded at a rapid pace across the European Union. The total number of passenger kilometres travelled by car increased, on average, by 1.9% per year between 1995 and 2003. Air transport 1 recorded an even faster growth, with the number of passenger kilometres increasing at an average annual rate of 4.9%. 1 Intra-EU and domestic flights only.

Results for the average of the 25 European Union countries show that a majority of European citizens do not feel encouraged to use their car less thanks to the offer of transport service where they live. This is both the case for urban transport (58%) and for medium and long distance transport (60%) for which Europeans make almost no distinction (see Figure 2.3). The car remains an essential means of transportation for Europeans. Transport services need therefore to make important efforts in order to become more attractive in the eyes of European citizens so as to encourage them to use their cars less for their transport needs. Cypriots were by far those who were the most numerous to respond negatively, with 89% claiming they would not feel encouraged to use their car less (see Figure 2.3). Slovenia followed with a rate of 75%. On the other hand, respondents in Luxembourg were far less pessimistic since only 37% indicated that they would not feel encouraged. Austria, Latvia and Germany also had rates below the 50% mark. As for medium and long distance transport, country results show a similar pattern as for urban transport.

        "2. Transport Services 16 (cid:4) Accessibility can be measured as the ratio of network length to the surface area of a given country. However, such an indicator should be interpreted with care as a result of different population densities between countries (for example, the Netherlands with 392 inhabitants per km 2 and 3.04 km of road per km 2 , and Finland with 15 inhabitants per km 2 and 0.31 km of road per km 2 ). Another measure is to compare network length to population. Both measures are combined in Figure 2.4. It can be seen that there were 3.3 metres of roads per inhabitant in Slovakia in 2003, less than one third of the EU average and almost 12 times less than in Estonia (39.2 m). Sparsely populated countries such as Sweden or Finland, which displayed a low density of roads in relation to surface area, reported high levels of road accessibility in terms of this measure (both over 15 m per inhabitant), which was more than in densely-covered Belgium (14.4 m), the Netherlands (7.8 m) and Malta (5.2 m). However, difficulties in the exact definition of \u2018road\u2019 does not allow for a precise comparison in this respect. \u2018Motorways\u2019 and \u2018Railway lines\u2019 are less problematic to define. Unsurprisingly, it appears that in 2003, motorways accounted for the smallest density among the different road types (see Table 2.5). There were 0.37 metres of roads per inhabitant in Cyprus in 2003 against 0.01 metres in Poland. Regarding railway lines, Finland reported the highest level of accessibility with 1.12 metres per inhabitant whereas the Netherlands represented the lowest density with 0.17 metres per inhabitant. NETWORK ACCESS F igure 2.4 Length of road network in relation to population and national territory, 2003 ( 1 ) (1 ) Roads: motorways, state roads, provincial roads and communal roads (the definition of road types varies from country to country, \u2018communal roads\u2019 sometimes includes roads without a hard surface).

Source : Energy and Transport in Figures, Directorate-General of the European Commission for Energy and Transport Network accessibility can also be determined by looking at the availability of vehicles or transport nodes in relation to population levels. When asked how they judge accessibility to transport services in 2006, some 17% of respondents to a Eurobarometer survey (65.3) said they had difficult or no access to local transport services (bus, tram, underground, etc.) and 24% difficult or no access to rail services. Access to local transport considered easy everywhere, except in Cyprus Among those who said they had easy access to local transport services individual country figures ranged from just 40% in Cyprus to 88% in Lithuania and Austria, 89% in Spain and 95% in Greece (see Table 2.6). At EU level the percentage rose by nine percentage points from 71% in 2004 to 80% in 2006. Conversely, 13% said access was difficult. This EU average masks important differences between countries from just 4% in Greece to 40% in Cyprus. It is again Cypriots who give the higher percentage saying spontaneously that they had no access to local transport networks. Here, it should be noted that public transport in Cyprus is essentially performed by privately- run bus services (except for the capital Nicosia) and 'shared' taxi services. Plans exist to expand and improve bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the EU. A similar figure (10%) was noted in Finland and figures of 8% (twice the EU-25 average) were also recorded in France, Ireland, Italy and Hungary. As might be anticipated, easy access to local transport networks was widely claimed by people living in large towns where 94% of those polled gave an affirmative answer compared with just two-thirds (67%) of those living in rural villages.

In 2004, the proportion of EU citizens saying that their access to the national rail network was easy was just 64%, which is 3 points higher than when the survey was carried out in 2002 (in the EU 15). This latest figure at 73% shows a continuing upward trend. One in six citizens, however, said they had difficult access to their country's rail network and this opinion was held by a quarter of the Polish (23%) and Slovenian (25%) polls. A relatively high number of citizens spontaneously saying that they had no access were noted in Ireland (20%), Latvia and Estonia (17%), and Portugal and Slovenia (15%). Understandably, there are variations on a country-by-country basis with some Member States (Cyprus and Malta) having no rail network and other countries benefiting from relatively highly-developed rail infrastructures. There are noticeable variations on a socio- demographic basis amongst the 73% of EU-25 citizens who said they had easy access to the railway network. While 68% of those aged 55 or more say they have easy access to the rail network, this figure rises substantially to 79% of those aged 15 to 24. Accessibility is obviously perceived as easier among the young. A similar variation is seen on the basis of education where just 64% of those who had left school at the earliest opportunity say they have easy access to the rail network compared with 77% of those who were educated to age 20 or more and 80% of those still studying. Figures also varied by occupation with 81% of white-collar workers, 80% of students and 79% of managers at one end of the range, and figures of just 69% and 67% amongst self-employed and retired people at the other. Apart from the generally mobile students, white-collar workers and managers might perceive access to the rail network as easy; but that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually use it.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 19 The standard measure of consumption for transport services is the number of passenger-kilometres (pkm), defined as the number of passengers transported multiplied by the number of kilometres travelled. This indicator allows a comparison of traffic between different transport modes. Total passenger traffic for the main transport services (bus, train, urban rail, air and sea transport) exceeded 1 380 billion pkm within the EU in 2003. Passenger cars accounted for almost 4 450 billion pkm. Hence, public transport services represented almost one fourth of total transport demand. 5.4 km by everybody, every day Combining traffic and demographic data, each EU-25 citizen travelled an average of 5.4 km per day using rail, tram, underground or bus services in 2003, compared to the EU-15 average of 4.2 km in 1970 and 4.9 km in 1980. A modal breakdown reveals that the EU-25 average person travelled 2.9 km by bus, 2.1 km by rail and 0.4 km by tram or underground in 2003 (see Figure 2.8). Nevertheless, European citizens most frequently travelled by car with an average of 26.7 km.

        "2. Transport Services 20 (cid:4) Buses and coaches were the principal passenger transport service in the EU in 2003, accounting for 9.0% of total passenger transport (by bus, train, urban rail or passenger car - see Figure 2.9) or an average of 1 060 km travelled per inhabitant during the year. Growth in bus and coach traffic has remained stable in the EU since the 1990s (see Table 2.10). Development at EU-level however masks individual trends in the various countries: whereas noticeable increases in the total performance between 1990 and 2003 were noted in Belgium, Greece, Sweden and particularly in Spain and Ireland, many new Member States, particularly the Baltic States and Slovenia, but also the Netherlands registered large decreases. The most important decreases often occurred during the 1990s. 2.1 URBAN TRANSPORT F igure 2.9 Share of transport modes in total passenger traffic, 2003 (%) (1 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 UK SE FI SK SI PT PL AT NL MT HU LU LT LV CY IT IE FR ES EL EE DE DK CZ BE EU-15 EU-25 Passenger cars ( ) Buses and coaches ( ) Tram and underground ( ) Railway ( ) 2 3 5 4 Source : Energy and Transport in Figures, Directorate-General of the European Commission for Energy and Transport (1 ) Share of total passenger traffic, including passenger cars, buses and coaches, tram and underground and railway; BG, HR, RO and TR not available.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 23 A Eurobarometer survey (65.3) carried out mid-2006 provides information on consumers' affordability of transport services within town/cities (bus, tram, underground, etc.). Across the European Union, a large majority (78%) of citizens considered local transport services within towns to be affordable and particularly high figures were noted in Greece (98%), Lithuania (93%), Malta (91%) and Slovakia (90%) (see Table 2.12). At the other extreme, 37% of the polled Finns said that these services were not affordable compared with an EU average of just 10%. The Dutch and German view on affordability stand out as at least 20% thought the price of transport services excessive compared to an EU average of 10%.

When looking at respondents' occupation, high and low figures were, as might be anticipated, seen between managers (84%) and the unemployed (72%) (see Table 2.13). There were just minimal variations based upon respondents' place of residence. There has been a noticeable change in attitude across the Union relating to the affordability of local transport networks. The number of respondents considering local transport services to be affordable has grown by 10 points from 68% in 2004 to 78% in this latest survey and the number saying they were not affordable has halved over the same period from 20% to 10%.

Transport Services 24 (cid:4) Of the total EU-25 panel involved in this survey, approximately a third said that they had access to transport services within towns, i.e. bus, tram, underground, etc. but did not make use of them. When this group is questioned as to whether they considered the price of these services to be affordable a half (54%) replied in the affirmative, while a further quarter (24%) were unaware of the cost of these services and therefore replied 'don't know' (see Table 2.14). Leading those who considered the prices to be affordable were 94% of Greeks and 83% of Maltese. The highest figures in the 'don't know' category were observed in Ireland (50%), Estonia (45%) and Cyprus (42%). Of this sample, 14% gave cost as the reason they did not use these services and includes relatively high figures of 26% of Finns. A further 8% of the poll stated spontaneously that the cost of these services was excessive and in the Netherlands, this group rises to 23% \u2013 nearly a quarter of those polled. While there were no major variations by gender, age or education, variations were seen by respondents' occupation with only 44% of the unemployed and 49% of the retired saying the cost of local transport services was affordable compared with 62% of managers. This sentiment was echoed by 60% of those living in large towns compared with 50% of those living in a rural environment.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 25 According to a Flash Eurobarometer survey (156) of the European Commission conducted in 2004 to measure the local perceptions of quality of life in 31 European cities, city residents are generally positive about their public transport - 64% are satisfied to very satisfied with the public transport in their city. In Rennes, Helsinki, Vienna, Dortmund and Luxembourg three out four of those polled were satisfied with public transport, while only in four cities more residents were unsatisfied than satisfied (see Figure 2.15). Recent events, however, can strongly influence people's opinion. In Rennes, for example, a metropolitan line was opened in 2002 and attracted far more passengers than expected. This explains, at least in part, why Rennes has the highest share of satisfied residents. In Copenhagen, on the other hand, a significant increase in the price of public transport caused a lot of dissatisfaction.

        "2. Transport Services 26 (cid:4) A consumer satisfaction survey on services of general interest 2 undertaken in 2006 provides detailed information on consumer satisfaction in relation to intra-urban transport. Intra-urban transport refers to the transport of passengers within the urban area of a city or town, by bus or rail. For the survey, consumers were defined as people aged at least 18 years old and having used the service during the past 12 months. Satisfaction was defined as the consumer's assessment of a product or service in terms of the extent to which that product or service has met his/her needs or expectations. Consumer satisfaction was to be measured both directly (\u2018observed satisfaction\u2019) as through statistical processing of responses to specific questions (\u2018calculated satisfaction\u2019). The questionnaire used for the survey mainly consists in the evaluation of several aspects of seven topics (overall satisfaction and expectations, quality, price, image, market and personal factors, complaints and commitment) by using a 10-point scale. The objective was to achieve consistency of the rating scales across countries and sectors. Dissatisfaction with urban transport mainly in Slovakia, Hungary but especially in Cyprus Urban transport is the general service where European consumers are, in general, least satisfied. The EU-25 average is 7.04 on a scale from 1 of 10. The satisfaction level is sensibly lower in the new Member States. Table 2.16 illustrates that the proportion of satisfied consumers 3 with urban transport is much lower and the proportion of dissatisfied consumers is much higher than in the other services surveyed. The lower average satisfaction level of the new Member States comes simultaneously from a lower percentage of satisfied consumers and from a higher percentage of respondents dissatisfied with the urban transport service. There are strong differences across Member States. The group of countries higher than the EU-25 average ranges from Ireland (66%) to Estonia (50%), with Finland, Latvia, Austria, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Belgium, Greece and Germany in-between. The group with scores similar to EU- 25 average starts with France (49%) and ends with Portugal (40%): it also contains Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Denmark. The other countries are below the European average. The lowest satisfaction rate is observed in Slovakia (22%). In terms of dissatisfaction the shares of most countries are in the range from 3.5% (the Netherlands - where remarkably also the satisfied numbers are much lower than elsewhere) to 17% (Sweden). Even higher figures are reached in the Czech Republic (19%), Hungary (22%), Slovakia (31%) and finally Cyprus (54%). It is recalled that the high percentage for the latter country can be explained by a poorly developed public transport system. 2 The consumer satisfaction survey was held in all 25 countries that are members of the European Union, and covers 11 \u2018service sectors of general interest\u2019: electricity supply, gas supply, water distribution, fixed telephony, mobile telephony, urban transport, extra-urban transport, air transport, postal services, retail banking and insurance services. 3 The satisfied respondents are those who rated the service from 8, 9 or 10 on a scale from 1 to 10. The dissatisfied ones rated the service 1, 2, 3 or 4 on a scale from 1 to 10. T able 2.16 Overall, to what extent are you satisfied with your urban transport supplier?

It appears that retired consumers are the most satisfied (55%). The self-employed are the group with the highest number of dissatisfied consumers (14%). Regarding the education level, consumers who left secondary school early and those who stopped studying between 16 and 19 years, appear to be the most satisfied (around 47%), whilst the satisfaction rate of those who kept on studying beyond 20 years (43%) is significantly under the EU average.

Urban transport operators in Ireland, Finland, Austria, Latvia, Greece, Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg have a good reputation according to more than 50% of the users. In Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia and Denmark they are less than 20% to think so. Speaking of quality of service, users in the EU-15 are more satisfied of the urban transport services than in the 10 new Member States (44% for the first against 37% for the latter). Overall, the results by country show similar profiles of responses to what has been observed for the overall image. Users in Ireland and Latvia are the most satisfied with the prices for urban transport services. Indeed, 56% of users in both countries said prices were fair (against an EU-25 average of 35%). The least satisfied are users in the Netherlands (17%), Slovakia (18%), Portugal (19%) and Denmark (20%). Reluctance to change when there's a choice In countries where people can have the choice between urban transport companies (i.e. Belgium, Greece, Finland, France, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) the large majority of users (89%) has no intention to change service provider in the short run (within the year). Speaking of competition, the majority of European users of urban transport services think there is not enough competition (62%), especially in Sweden (84%), France (83%), the Netherlands (72%) and Slovakia (71%) whereas in Portugal and Ireland, users tend to have the opposite feeling (58% and 53% of positive answers respectively). In addition, more than five users out of ten feel that it would not be easy to change from one urban transport company to another. Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 27 ",
        "2. Transport Services 28 (cid:4) Rail remains an important mode of transport that accounted for 6.5% of passenger transport in 2003 (see Figure 2.9). Each EU citizen travelled an average of 755 km by train in 2003 (see Table 2.2 at the beginning of this section). However, for EU-15, the average was 794 km in 2003 compared to an average of 736 km in 1990. The French (1 195 km) and Danish (1 079 km) were the most active train users, as opposed to the Lithuanians (125 km), the Estonians (135 km) and the Greeks (143 km). Table 2.18 outlines the evolution of the passenger transport performance by railways. In 2005, the total number of passenger-kilometres performed at EU-25 level stood still 6% under that of 1990. However, after a minimum reached in 2002, a slight upward development was registered. Negative trends were particularly marked in many new Member States, where during the same period, the motorisation rate has rapidly increased. When limiting the view to EU-15, the picture is different: compared to 1990, transport performance in 2005 stood close to 19% higher. Belgium, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom registered the highest relative increases, whereas an important drop during the 1990s was registered in Portugal. 2.2 RAILWAYS T able 2.18 Railways - evolution of passenger transport (billion pkm) Source : Energy and Transport in Figures, Directorate-General of the European Commission for Energy and Transport 9 1 0 9 0 2 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 4 0 0 2 5 0 5 2 - U E 5 . 7 5 3 6 . 0 5 3 2 . 5 4 3 0 . 9 4 3 7 . 2 5 3 4 . 0 5 3 6 . 1 8 3 5 1 - U E 2 . 9 1 3 9 . 0 1 3 2 . 4 0 3 3 . 6 0 3 9 . 7 0 3 1 . 4 0 3 8 . 8 6 2 E B 1 . 9 7 . 8 3 . 8 3 . 8 0 . 8 7 . 7 5 . 6 Z C 7 . 6 6 . 6 5 . 6 6 . 6 3 . 7 3 . 7 3 . 3 1 K D 8 . 5 9 . 5 8 . 5 7 . 5 7 . 5 5 . 5 1 . 5 E D 9 . 4 7 6 . 2 7 3 . 1 7 4 . 1 7 8 . 5 7 4 . 5 7 0 . 1 6 E E 2 . 0 2 . 0 2 . 0 2 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 5 . 1 L E 9 . 1 7 . 1 6 . 1 8 . 1 7 . 1 9 . 1 0 . 2 S E 8 . 9 1 0 . 9 1 3 . 9 1 5 . 9 1 2 . 9 1 6 . 8 1 5 . 5 1 R F 5 . 6 7 3 . 4 7 9 . 1 7 2 . 3 7 2 . 1 7 6 . 9 6 0 . 4 6 E I 8 . 1 6 . 1 6 . 1 6 . 1 5 . 1 4 . 1 2 . 1 T I 1 . 6 4 7 . 5 4 2 . 5 4 0 . 6 4 8 . 6 4 1 . 7 4 7 . 4 4 Y C - - - - - - - V L 9 . 0 8 . 0 8 . 0 7 . 0 7 . 0 7 . 0 4 . 5 T L 3 . 0 4 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 6 . 3 U L 3 . 0 3 . 0 3 . 0 3 . 0 3 . 0 3 . 0 2 . 0 U H 6 . 9 5 . 0 1 3 . 0 1 5 . 0 1 0 . 0 1 7 . 9 4 . 1 1 T M - - - - - - - L N 0 . 4 1 5 . 3 1 8 . 3 1 3 . 4 1 4 . 4 1 7 . 4 1 1 . 1 1 T A 5 . 8 3 . 8 2 . 8 3 . 8 2 . 8 2 . 8 6 . 8 L P 7 . 7 1 2 . 8 1 6 . 9 1 7 . 0 2 5 . 2 2 1 . 4 2 4 . 0 5 T P 8 . 3 7 . 3 3 . 3 7 . 3 7 . 3 6 . 3 7 . 5 I S 8 . 0 8 . 0 8 . 0 7 . 0 7 . 0 7 . 0 4 . 1 K S 2 . 2 2 . 2 3 . 2 7 . 2 8 . 2 9 . 2 4 . 6 I F 5 . 3 3 . 3 3 . 3 3 . 3 3 . 3 4 . 3 3 . 3 E S 9 . 8 9 . 8 1 . 9 0 . 9 7 . 8 2 . 8 6 . 6 K U 4 . 4 4 5 . 3 4 1 . 1 4 0 . 0 4 3 . 9 3 4 . 8 3 4 . 3 3 G B : 4 . 2 5 . 2 6 . 2 0 . 3 5 . 3 8 . 7 R H 3 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 0 . 1 4 . 3 O R : 6 . 8 5 . 8 5 . 8 0 . 1 1 6 . 1 1 6 . 0 3 R T 0 . 5 2 . 5 9 . 5 2 . 5 6 . 5 8 . 5 4 . 6 Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 28 ",
        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 29 Daily commute between Sweden and Denmark As regards international rail passenger transport, it is interesting to identify the main country-pairs. Table 2.19 provides indications on the most important relations in 2004. It appears that 70% of the total volume of international rail passenger transport at EU level in 2004 was carried out on these 20 relations alone. The relations between Denmark and Sweden and vice versa accounted for more than 18%. These first two relations in Table 2.19 deserve special attention as it concerns a single link: the \u00d6resund fixed link opened in July 2000. The combined two- track rail and four-lane road bridge offered more than 6 million rail passengers a gateway to either Sweden and Denmark. According to the consortium operating the bridge, close to half of the rail passengers in 2005 consisted of daily commuters (paying special tariffs). A similar situation exists between France and the United Kingdom (rank 6 and 7) where the Channel Tunnel is the only link for international rail traffic between these countries. The country pair Luxembourg-France (declared by Luxembourg) can be found on rank 9. As these two countries have only a limited amount of cross border lines, one would expect similar passenger volumes declared between France and Luxembourg (declared by France). However, the latter country pair does not appear in the top- 20. This might be linked to fact that passenger volumes declared by French authorities are only based on the sale of regular tickets and do not take into account the season ticket holders of the numerous cross-border workers that come into Luxembourg to work.

        "2. Transport Services 30 (cid:4) A Eurobarometer survey (65.3) carried out an inquiry on consumers' affordability of rail services between towns/cities. A very high proportion of Greeks (97%) found the cost of rail services between towns and cities to be affordable (see Table 2.20). High figures of 94% in Lithuania and 90% in Slovakia were also recorded compared with an EU-25 average of 74%. At the other end of the scale, 36% of Finns considered train fares to be not affordable - a figure well above the EU-25 average of 13%. Of the Dutch 29% and 19% of Germans and Austrians spontaneously stated that rail fares were excessive.

(% of respondents using rail services between towns/cities) There were minimal variations by gender, age and education when respondents who used rail services were asked whether they were affordable or not. Even by occupational grouping, where noticeable variations are often noted, figures ranged between just 72% and 77% with the exception of the unemployed where a smaller figure of 67% was recorded (see Table 2.21). In a similar attitude shift to that noted in relation to local transport networks, the numbers saying that national rail services are affordable has risen from 63% to 74% over the past two years while the number saying they are not affordable has fallen from 24% to 13%. The percentage of those considering them excessive has remained roughly the same - down by one point to 10% since 2004.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 31 Half of the group (49%) who had access to rail services between towns but did not use them said that cost was not the reason as they considered the prices affordable (see Table 2.22). This figure is particularly high in Greece where 91% gave this as their response. In fact, 60% of Latvians, 55% of Estonians and 54% of the Irish contributed to the 26% overall figure of those who were unaware of the price of rail services between towns. However, 25% of this segment of the poll gave financial reasons for not using rail services. Of them, 15% stated that they were not affordable, while a further 10% spontaneously said that the cost of rail travel was excessive. Of the 49% average saying that, the service was affordable, even though they did not use it, there are variations by age and education. Amongst the oldest group polled, 43% considered rail services affordable compared with 53% of those aged 15 to 39 (see Table 2.23). A similar variation was observed by education with 44% of those educated to age 15 or less giving this response compared with 54% of those educated to age 20 or beyond. When respondents' occupation was looked at, the sets of figures which stood out were the 56% of managers and white- collar workers who said train services were affordable compared with just 43% of the unemployed and an even smaller proportion (40%) of the retired.

        "2. Transport Services 32 (cid:4) Concerning services supplied by extra-urban transport, which refers to the transport of passengers between cities, by bus or rail, including international transport between European cities, a consumer satisfaction survey on services of general interest undertaken in 2006 also allows for some results on consumer satisfaction in relation to extra-urban transport. In fact, the average satisfaction of the extra-urban transport service is the second lowest of all the services of general interest considered in this survey 4 . There are no significant differences between EU-15 and the 10 new Member States. However, the proportions of both satisfied and dissatisfied respondents in the new Member States are higher than in EU-15, as can be seen from Table 2.24. Among the countries with a satisfaction rate beyond the European average (which of 46%), the distribution shows that Ireland takes the lead with 72% of consumers who are satisfied. Next come Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Greece, with figures between 63% and 67%. The satisfaction levels in Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Germany are not significantly different from the EU average. In Slovakia, Italy and the Netherlands the figure is below 30%. In Slovakia the number of dissatisfied consumers reaches 23%, more than double the EU average. Six other countries - Italy, Hungary, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria - show a percentage of dissatisfied consumers between 13% and 18%.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 33 Table 2.25 shows the proportion of satisfied and dissatisfied consumers distributed by socio-economic category. It appears that amongst the retired people, blue- collar workers and homemakers about half of the consumers are satisfied - which is significantly higher than the EU-25 average for this sector. The unemployed people, managers and self-employed people are around 45%, which is statistically equal to the EU average. White collar workers score around 40% and students around 30%, which is significantly under the average proportion of satisfied consumers. The earlier consumers left school, the more satisfied they are. Age is also related to satisfaction: older consumers are more satisfied, and there are more dissatisfied consumers with younger people. Men and women do not differ in this regard.

(2 ) Excluding Cyprus and Malta since there is no extra-urban (rail) transport in these countries. Extra-urban transport operators in Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Greece, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Estonia, Portugal and Poland have a good reputation according to more than 50% of the users. In Denmark and the Netherlands, they are less than 20% to think so. Overall, the results by country show similar patterns of responses to what has been observed for the overall image. Users in Ireland and Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary and the United Kingdom are the most satisfied with the prices for extra-urban transport services (more than 50% of users are satisfied). The least satisfied are users in the Netherlands (14%), Italy (18%), Slovakia (22%) and Denmark (28%). Remarkably, the proportion of dissatisfied people is rather significant in the European Union (15%), in particular in Denmark (34%) and Slovakia (33%). In both countries mentioned, the proportion of dissatisfied users is even greater than that of satisfied users. In countries where people can choose between extra- urban transport companies (all except Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, France, Hungary, Luxembourg and Malta) the greatest majority of users (88%) has no intention to change service provider in the short run (within the year). Most of the EU-25 users (70%) think that extra-urban transport services are available for everybody in their country, especially in Greece (91%). However, it is the case for only 48% of users in Sweden. Speaking of competition, European users of extra-urban transport services are divided when asked to say whether there is enough competition in their country or not. Indeed, 46% answer positively and the same proportion has the opposite opinion. However, users in the New Member States have a more positive evaluation than those of EU-15: in the first group, 51% think there is enough competition while the others are only 44% to think so. In Austria, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden there is a great majority of negative answers while in Estonia, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom, a great majority thinks there is enough competition. Cross border purchasing in the area of extra-urban transport convinces a small proportion of European users (30%). However, it is greater than what was observed for urban transport (15%). Finally, similarly to what has been observed for other services, the great majority of EU-25 citizens (75%) prefer to deal with a national operator as far as extra-urban transport is concerned.

        "2. Transport Services 34 (cid:4) Passenger traffic on intra-EU-25 flights increased at an average annual rate of 7.6% between 1995 and 2000 but, in all probability, due to tragic events of September 11 th 2001, decreased slightly in 2001 and 2002. It increased again by 3.9% in 2003. Table 2.26 provides an EU-25 ranking of the 40 busiest airports in 2004 in terms of total passengers carried, together with the rank of the top airport for the 8 Member States where no airport appeared in the top 40. London/Heathrow continues to hold the top rank with over 67 million passengers; this is 10% of the total air passengers in EU-25. Paris/Charles-de-Gaulle and Frankfurt-Main compete for second place with the rank order in 2004 reversing that of 2003; Paris/Charles-de- Gaulle being in second place in 2004 with just under 51 million passengers followed by Frankfurt-Main with 50.7 million. As in 2003 Amsterdam/Schiphol (42.4 million) and Madrid/Barajas (38 million) follow in the ranking. Three of the top 40 airports (Berlin/Tegel, Birmingham and Tenerife Sur/Reina Sofia) recorded a small fall in the number of passengers between 2003 and 2004, resulting in a drop in the rank order for the last two airports. Prague/Ruzyne (9.6 million passengers) remains the top airport amongst the new Member States, having moved from a rank of 36 th in 2003 to 27 th in 2004. Budapest/Ferihegy (from 45 th in 2003 to 39 th in 2004) and Warsaw/Okecie (44 th in 2003 and 41 st in 2004) have also moved up in the rankings. 2.3 AIR TRANSPORT Number of passengers (thousands) Growth 2003- 2004 (%) 1 London/Heathrow UK 67 110 6.2 2 Paris/Charles-de-Gaulle FR 50 951 6.1 3 Frankfurt-Main DE 50 700 5.6 4 Amsterdam/Schiphol NL 42 425 6.6 5 Madrid/Barajas ES 38 155 7.9 6 London/Gatwick UK 31 392 5.0 7 Roma/Fiumicino IT 27 160 6.6 8 M\u00fcnchen DE 26 601 11.1 9 Barcelona ES 24 354 8.3 10 Paris/Orly FR 24 049 7.1 11 Manchester/Intl UK 20 970 7.4 12 London/Stansted UK 20 909 11.7 13 Palma de Mallorca ES 20 363 6.5 14 Kobenhavn/Kastrup DK 18 889 7.6 15 Milano/Malpensa IT 18 419 5.4 16 Dublin IE 17 032 7.9 17 Stockholm/Arlanda SE 16 467 7.7 18 Bruxelles/National BE 15 445 2.3 19 D\u00fcsseldorf DE 15 092 6.8 20 Wien/Schwechat AT 14 711 15.7 21 Atens EL 13 659 11.7 22 Malaga ES 11 930 4.6 23 Berlin-Tegel DE 10 976 -0.5 24 Helsinki-Vantaa FI 10 729 10.5 25 Lisboa PT 10 394 9.4 26 Hamburg DE 9 764 4.3 27 Praha/Ruzyne CZ 9 573 28.8 28 Nice/C\u00f4te d'Azur FR 9 327 2.2 29 Las Palmas/Gran Canaria ES 9 218 3.1 30 Milano/Linate IT 8 945 2.5 31 Birmingham UK 8 797 -1.4 32 Stuttgart DE 8 649 16.6 33 Glasgow UK 8 557 5.4 34 Alicante ES 8 532 4.6 35 Tenerife Sur/Reina Sofia ES 8 370 -3.3 36 K\u00f6ln/Bonn DE 8 249 7.5 37 Edinburgh UK 7 992 6.9 38 London Luton UK 7 520 10.8 39 Budapest/Ferihegy HU 6 445 28.6 40 Lyon/Satolas FR 6 125 4.5 41 Warsawa/Okecie PL 6 092 17.9 48 Larnaka CY 4 742 5.3 73 Malta/Luqa MT 2 790 5.4 107 Luxembourg LU 1 509 4.1 123 Riga Airport LV 1 056 48.7 125 Ljubljana SI 1 046 13.0 127 Vilnius Intl LT 994 37.6 128 Tallinn/Ulemiste EE 991 39.5 Source : Air transport in Europe in 2004, Statistics in Focus, Transport 2/2006, Eurostat, 2006 T able 2.26 Top airports in EU-25 in terms of total passengers carried, 2004 Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 34 ",

This was an increase of 14.5% on the number for 2003. Increased traffic was recorded in all world regions; for the majority of regions the increase was over 10% and over 20% for four regions. As a share of the total extra-EU traffic, countries of Europe outside EU-25, with 71 million passengers being transported in 2004, formed almost a third of the total (31.8%), This was followed by North America with nearly a quarter share (23.6% - over 50 million passengers). The African continent accounted for 16% of international extra-EU passenger transport with 36 million passengers. North Africa (with popular holiday destinations) was the origin or destination of 24 million of these passengers. Increases in traffic in excess of 24% compared to 2003 were recorded for North Africa and East Africa. The rest of Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa registered increases well below the average: 5.0%, 5.4% and 7.2% respectively. Increases in traffic of just over 20% were registered to the Far East and to the Near and Middle East, showing a recovery from the previous year when the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in the Far East and the war in Iraq took place.

For France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the region of Europe except EU-25 represents 20% or less of the total in contrast to Latvia and Slovenia where the share is over 80%. This region has the largest share for all the new Member States except for Slovakia, where the share for Africa is larger.

        "2. Transport Services 36 (cid:4) Air transport considered highly satisfactory According to a consumer satisfaction survey undertaken in 2006, air transport is the service which European consumers are most satisfied with. The average satisfaction is relatively high (it amounts to 7.96 in a scale from 1 to 10); it is even higher in the new Member States. The proportion of satisfied consumers is high, mainly in the new Member Sates (almost 3 out of 4 consumers gave a score of 8 or higher - see Table 2.29). The satisfaction rates in the countries with a score higher than the EU-25 average range from 83% (Germany) to 74% (Slovenia). This group also contains Cyprus, Hungary, Austria, Lithuania, Finland, Greece and the Czech Republic. In many European countries the proportion of satisfied consumers is not statistically different from the EU average (66%). Only five countries drag the European average down: Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Italy, with satisfaction levels from 60% to 51% and, sensibly below this, Spain with 45%.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 37 Table 2.30 shows the proportion of satisfied and dissatisfied consumers distributed by socio-economic category. The professional categories that are most satisfied with air transport are the blue collars workers (71%) and the retired people (70%). On the other hand, the managers are relatively less satisfied, with only 63% of satisfied respondents. One may wonder whether this result is related to the frequency of use. This question was not asked in the survey. However, if one uses the proportion of respondents who answered to the questions related to air transport as a proxy for the frequency of use it appears that the occasional users are relatively more satisfied. This could be due to the fact that they associate air transport with pleasant occasions such as holiday trips.

Source : Consumer satisfaction survey, Directorate-General of the European Commission for Health and Consumer Protection, 2006 In Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic more than eight users out of ten consider the national air transport company as having an overall positive image (for an EU-25 average of 65%). Although in Spain and Italy less than 50% of users are satisfied with their air transport company, the proportion of dissatisfied consumers is very low (7% and 6% respectively), in line with the EU-25 average (4%). The overall quality of services convinces a majority of users, especially in the new Member States (76% against 67% in the EU-15). Again the Czech Republic (87%), Germany (86%) and Finland (84%) are at the top of the list together with Hungary where users are a little more convinced of the quality of services provided by their air transport company (83% against an average for the new Member States of 76%) than its overall reputation on the market (79% against an average for the new Member States of 77%). For a large share of users in Germany (77%), Hungary (73%), the Czech Republic (72%), Ireland (71%), the United Kingdom (68%), Latvia (67%), Austria (66%), Slovakia (64%) and Finland (61%), the air transport company they use most has fair prices. This is less the case in Spain (34%), Italy and Portugal (36% both), the Netherlands (37%), Sweden (43%), France (44%) and Malta (46%). It is interesting to note that almost one fifth of Dutch users are dissatisfied with the prices charged by their usual air transport company (for an EU-25 average of 12%). Danes, Swedes and Slovenes least attached to national air operators Remarkably, although the level of commitment to air transport companies is relatively high (76%), it seems to be lower in the new Member States (67%) than in the EU-15 (77%). More than 80% of respondents in Finland, Greece, Portugal, Luxembourg and Germany said they will still use their national air transport company in the next 12 months whereas in Slovakia and Hungary they are respectively 56% and 59% to say so. Considering the liberalisation in air transport, the preference for a national operator is less marked than for other services, especially in the new Member States (54% against 61% in the EU-15). The least attached to national operators are the Danes, the Swedes and the Slovenes as a majority (more than 50%) said they do not prefer to deal with a national air transport company. The Greeks and people from Cyprus have the opposite opinion (more than 80% of positive answers). T able 2.30 Overall, to what extent are you satisfied with your air transport supplier?

        "2. Transport Services 38 (cid:4) Air passenger rights: common rules not only since liberalisation The single market for air transport in the European Union has greatly benefited passengers: they enjoy lower fares and a wider choice of carriers and services than in the past. But other measures are needed to protect passengers' interests and ensure that they fully profit from the single market. Air passengers are in a weak position to defend their rights. For example, when booking a flight, they have to accept conditions laid down by airlines; they cannot negotiate their contracts - and rarely know them. When their journeys do not go as planned, perhaps because of denied boarding or cancellation of a flight, they rely on the good will of the carrier to continue their journey or return home. In such cases, passengers are badly placed to look after themselves, particularly when being far from home. With regard to the frequent problem of denied boarding in spite of a confirmed ticket (overbooking), the EU has taken action as early as 1991 when Regulation 295/91/EEC came into force. A system of compensation payment by the airline operating the flight was installed, together with the offering of alternative travel arrangements and the provision of meals and accommodation, if necessary. This Regulation was however limited to scheduled flights departing from an airport within an EU Member State. Package flights were governed by Directive 90/314/EEC. Since February 2005: rights extended to more flights In 17 February 2005, Regulation 261/2004 came into force, extending the rights to charter and domestic flights. Furthermore, when a flight is operated by an airline based in an EU Member State, these rights also apply to flights from an airport outside the EU to a destination inside the EU. Going beyond cases of denied boarding or the cancellation of flights, long delays are now also covered. Passengers' rights include to be informed about their rights by the airline in the form of a written notice, reimbursement of their tickets, a free return flight to the point of departure, if appropriate or a later flight to their destination, or compensation (staggered up to EUR 600 for flights of over 3500 km). Additionally, meals, refreshments, means of telecommunication and hotel accommodation if necessary must be made available even if the incidents happen outside the control of the airline (force majeure). In the event of a cancellation, passengers have the right to compensation as for denied boarding/overbooking and this under certain conditions. There is no financial compensation foreseen for delays as this often happens outside the airlines' control. All measures also apply to passengers flying with a ticket issued under a fidelity program of an airline. Application to low-cost air carriers, too Passenger rights as explained above apply to low-cost airlines as well. Indeed, the amounts for financial compensation are not linked to the ticket price as there is no difference with regard to the discomfort a passenger is subjected to, whether flying first class or low-cost. Passengers are always entitled to receive written information on their rights, appropriate assistance and alternatives to proceed with their travel plans or to receive a refund - even if the incidents happen under force-majeure circumstances.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 39 Initiatives beyond the measures linked to the operation of flights The Council of Ministers and the European Parliament agreed on a series of rights for passengers with reduced mobility in Regulation 1107/2006 of 5 July 2006. The regulation includes the creation in all airports with over 150 000 passengers of designated points which people with reduced mobility can approach to request assistance. They cannot be refused boarding, except in a few very strictly defined cases. The airport operators are responsible for the provision of these services free of charge; those affected cannot be charged for any additional costs. The request for assistance (for example to and from the aircraft) must be made known by the persons concerned at least 48 hours before departure. All airlines serving the airport (according to their passenger share) are to contribute to the financing of these services. The objective of Regulation 785/2004 of 21 April 2004 was the harmonisation of the level of insurance in air transport, establishing the minimum levels of insurance cover per passenger and per item of luggage. The minimum level of insurance in respect of third-party liability was also established. The rules are equally valid for Community airlines as for non-EU aircraft operators and apply to damage occurring in flight and on the ground. As well as accidents, insurance must also cover the risks of war, hijackings, acts of terrorism and sabotage. Aircraft operators are obliged to present insurance certificates to the competent Member State authorities. Regulation [EC]889/2002 transposed the Montreal Convention on liabilities of airlines into Community law; damage-claims can be initiated in a court proceeding for a delay in the transport of passengers and their baggage, including for domestic EU-flights (within one Member State). Regulation [EC] 2111/2005 on the blacklist of airlines also includes the right for passengers to know who will transport them to their booked destination (identity of the operating carrier) and this at the moment of booking or, if not possible, at a later stage. More information on the right of air passengers can be obtained through: http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air_portal/passenger_rights/information_en.htm Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 39 ",
        "2. Transport Services 40 (cid:4) Maritime links can be of considerable importance for countries with many islands (such as Denmark, Greece, Spain, Italy, Sweden and France), but also for countries with significant coastlines, for which inter-country links are very important (such as Greece/Italy, Ireland/UK, UK/France or Nordic countries. Conversely, passenger transport via inland waterways is very limited and of low importance (except perhaps for transport in and around Venice and on the North Italian lakes). The top-20 ports are detailed in Table 2.32 below, for the total of passengers embarked and disembarked. Certain ports display similar or identical figures. These correspond to port pairs linked by a ferry connection (Rio-Antirio, Paloukia Salaminas-Perama, Helsingborg-Helsingor, Messina-Reggio di Calabria). It should be noted that the connection Rio-Antirio has became obsolete in 2004 as a fixed link now connects mainland Greece to the Peloponese. 2.4 WATER TRANSPORT Inwards Outwards EU-25 207 368 205 213 EU-15 202 773 200 720 BE 371 369 CZ - - DK 24 358 24 294 DE 16 036 16 110 EE 2 615 2 557 EL 51 460 51 300 ES 10 782 9 259 FR 13 700 13 705 IE 1 874 1 872 IT 41 287 41 289 CY 144 143 LV 57 61 LT 68 67 LU - - HU - - MT 71 69 NL 1 024 990 AT - - PL 1 617 1 572 PT 306 310 SI 23 24 SK - - FI 8 216 8 125 SE 16 545 16 203 UK 16 814 16 894 BG 3 1 RO 0 0 T able 2.31 Passenger transport by Member States: passengers embarked and disembarked in all ports, 2003 (thousands) Source : Maritime transport of goods and passengers 1997- 2003, Statistics in focus, Transport 9/2005, Eurostat, 2005 Number of passengers (thousands) Growth 2002-2003 (%) 1 Dover UK 14 770 -10.2 2 Calais FR 13 729 -8.4 3 Antirio EL 13 688 -3.7 4 Rio EL 13 688 -3.7 5 Paloukia Salaminas EL 12 541 3.4 6 Perama EL 12 541 3.4 7 Helsingborg SE 11 693 0.2 8 Helsingor DK 11 646 0.3 9 Messina IT 9 833 -4.1 10 Reggio Di Calabria IT 9 698 -4.3 11 Piraeus EL 9 315 7.8 12 Helsinki FI 8 549 -3.6 13 Stockholm SE 7 294 6.9 14 Napoli IT 6 811 1.5 15 Puttgarden DE 6 422 -2.6 16 Rodby (Faergehavn) DK 6 421 -1.3 17 Tallinn EE 5 172 0.7 18 Santa Cruz De Tenerife ES 5 011 3.1 19 Capri IT 4 749 -5.5 20 Algeciras ES 4 542 6.0 T able 2.32 Top-20 ports in passenger transport - number of passengers embarked and disembarked, 2003 (thousand) Source : Maritime transport of goods and passengers 1997-2003, Statistics in focus, Transport 9/2005, Eurostat, 2005 Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 40 ",
        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 41 2.5 CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE AND PRICES From the methodological point of view, it is important to keep in mind that transport expenditure may be associated with a variety of activities, including tourism. It may not always be easy to make a distinction between accommodation and travel expenditure, especially in the case of package holidays. Although estimations can often be made, this was not the case in Austria, where expenditure on transport services from the Household Budget Survey excludes holiday travel, hence underestimating mean expenditure levels. Similarly in Denmark, data for passenger transport by railway is aggregated with bus transport and recorded as combined passenger transport. EU-15 households generally spent between 206 PPS (Spain) and 438 PPS (Luxembourg) on transport services in 1999, with the exception of Austria 5 (149 PPS), Ireland (516 PPS) and the United Kingdom (522 PPS) that displayed values outside this range (see Figure 2.33). Transport by bus or coach and rail accounted for the largest proportion of total expenditure in each Member State (see Figure 2.34).

        "2. Transport Services 42 (cid:4) Transport prices rose at a faster pace than inflation between 2001 and 2005 (see Figures 2.35 and 2.36). Price level indices underline the considerable difference in passenger transport tariffs that exist within the EU-25. These differences may reflect a wide range of costs, as well as different policies with respect to subsidising public transport. As a general rule, transport service tariffs are higher in northern Europe than in eastern Europe. Data for earlier years showed that the Czech Republic, Greece, Lithuania and Slovakia displayed the lowest price levels compared with the EU average for all of the main transport modes in 2002, whilst consumers in the United Kingdom faced the highest price levels for transport services (some 63% above the EU average). Price levels were also relatively high in Sweden (53% above the EU average), Denmark and Finland (both 44%).

Latvia was the only Member State that registered a decrease (-14%) whereas Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia recorded increases over 30%. Cyprus and Slovakia stood out of the lot when considering road transport, with price increases exceeding 40% (EU-25 average: 16%). Here, Belgium was the only country to report a decrease (-6%). The picture is less uniform for air transport: the EU average price increase of close to 12% incorporates a variety of country values that range from price decreases of around 20% (Belgium, Estonia) to price increases as high as 40% (Spain, Italy, Lithuania). Transport by sea and inland waterways is obviously of lesser importance at EU level but it should nevertheless be noted that for countries such as Greece and Malta, where water transport plays a substantial role, prices increased by 36% and 27%, respectively.

        "2. Transport Services 44 (cid:4) A 2005 Eurobarometer survey (63.2) on passengers' rights tried to give a horizontal perspective of the opinions of Europeans on the different transport services, namely local urban transport, inter-city rail transport, air transport, ferry services and international bus transport. When comparing results of the different transport services for the information on prices and terms, it can be noted that in general a majority of Europeans considers this information to be satisfactory or comprehensive for each service. Passengers of ferry services seem to be the most numerous to agree that information on prices and terms for this service is satisfactory, with a rate of 71% (see Figure 2.37). Inter-city rail transport services and international bus transport follow with 68%. Finally, urban transport reaches a rate of 64%. Nevertheless, it is important to note here that one third (32%) of citizens disagree with this statement and do not find this information satisfactory. A similar remark can be made for inter-city rail transport. This item was not suggested for air transport services. However, Europeans are divided on whether or not air fares are indicated unambiguously. While 39% answer that prices are not indicated unambiguously, 32% answer on the contrary that they are, and another 29% answer that they don't know. This allows it to be assumed that for this transport service, the information on prices and terms is less satisfactory.

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 45 2.6 SELECTED ASPECTS LINKED TO TRANSPORT SERVICES The concept of quality can be associated with a variety of parameters: availability, accessibility, information to customers, time (length of trip, adherence to schedule), customer service, comfort, safety, as well as environmental impact. Some of these can be objectively measured, such as accessibility, punctuality or safety and they are addressed elsewhere in this chapter. But others may be more subjective feelings that also help to shape consumers' opinions of the general quality of the services being offered. ATTITUDES ON TRANSPORT OF PERSONS WITH REDUCED MOBILITY When comparing results between the different transport services for the statement that people with reduced mobility are adequately taken care of (addressed in Eurobarometer survey (63.2) on passenger rights), it can be noted that there are several important discrepancies of opinion. The highest rate of agreement can be found for air transport companies with a rate of 66% among persons having already used air transport services in the last twelve months (see Figure 2.38). The care given by ferry companies to people with reduced mobility is also acknowledged by a slight majority of passengers in general having used ferry services (54%). However, for the other three transport services, citizens seem divided: 42% of respondents agree that international bus companies take adequately care of people with reduced mobility, against 34% who disagree and 24% who don't know. As for inter- city rail transport companies, the rates are 41% agreeing against 47% disagreeing. Finally, the results for urban transport companies show that only a minority of 37% agree with this statement against 55% who disagree that people with reduced mobility are adequately taken care of by these companies. It can be concluded that urban transport companies and inter-city rail transport companies have a more negative image when it comes to the care of people with reduced mobility. % 7 3 % 1 4 % 2 4 % 4 5 % 6 6 % 5 5 % 7 4 % 4 3 % 2 2 % 0 2 % 7 % 2 1 % 4 2 % 4 2 % 4 1 % 0 0 1 % 5 7 % 0 5 % 5 2 % 0 t r o p s n a r t n a b r u y b s e i n a p m o c t r o p s n a r t l i a r y t i c - r e t n i y b s e i n a p m o c s u b l a n o i t a n r e t n i y b s e i n a p m o c s e i n a p m o c y r r e f y b s e i n a p m o c t r o p s n a r t r i a y b e e r g A e e r g a s i D w o n k t o n o D F igure 2.38 People with reduced mobility are adequately taken care of by \u2026 (% of respondents in the EU-25) Source : Eurobarometer 63.2 (Passengers' Rights), European Commission, 2005 Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 45 ",
        "2. Transport Services 46 (cid:4) ATTITUDES ON THE FILING OF COMPLAINTS The comparison of the views as to the efficiency of improving transport services by making suggestions or filing complaints shows that throughout all the different services a majority of Europeans agree. Nevertheless, this agreement rate is somewhat higher for air transport services, at a rate of 60% (see Figure 2.39). Inter-city rail transport services (54%), international bus transport services (54%), urban transport services (53%) and ferry services (52%) all score similar rates above the 50% mark. One should however note the somewhat higher levels of disagreement with this statement for urban transport services and inter-city rail transport services, with rates of respectively 39% and 37%. Again, these two services have a somewhat more negative image among EU citizens. It is important to keep in mind that the respondent's perception of the \u2018efficiency\u2019 of making suggestions or filing complaints in order to improve transport services remains somewhat relative here: for the most part, these opinions are simply based on the principle of undertaking such actions, and far less on the respondent's actual experience of having done so in the past. % 2 5 % 3 5 % 4 5 % 4 5 % 0 6 % 0 3 % 9 3 % 8 2 % 7 3 % 1 3 % 8 1 % 8 % 8 1 % 9% 9 % 0 0 1 % 5 7 % 0 5 % 5 2 % 0 s e c i v r e s y r r e f s e c i v r e s t r o p s n a r t n a b r u t r o p s n a r t s u b l a n o i t a n r e t n i s e c i v r e s t r o p s n a r t l i a r y t i c - r e t n i s e c i v r e s s e c i v r e s t r o p s n a r t r i a e e r g A e e r g a s i D w o n k t o n o D F igure 2.39 Making suggestions or filing complaints is an efficient means of improving\u2026 (% of respondents in the EU-25) Source : Eurobarometer 63.2 (Passengers' Rights), European Commission, 2005 In the 2006 Eurobarometer survey (65.3) on services of general interest, nobody in seven of the 25 Member States of the European Union had made a complaint about transport services within towns and cities over the past two years. It required relatively high figures of 12% in Sweden, 8% in Cyprus and 6% in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy and Denmark to push the EU average level of complaints up to just 4%. The split in the channels of complaint carries on the established pattern in that the majority of complaints (i.e. 3%) are directed to the service provider and just 1% to a complaint-handling body. When looking at the 4% of users of transport services within towns who had made a complaint over the last two years, there were no significant variations by gender, age, education or occupation. Still, according to the same survey, 5% of EU-25 citizens had cause to complain about some aspect of rail services between towns and cities over the past two years and relatively high figures are observed in the Netherlands (12%) and in the United Kingdom and Italy where the complaints level reaches 7%. The groups more likely to complain and therefore be above the 5% EU-25 average were those educated to 20 or more (7%), self-employed (8%) and managers (9%). Apart from this, no other noticeable patterns were observed. Complaint handling relating to transport services within towns and cities produced a 10 percentage-point divide between the 54% saying that their complaint was dealt with well compared with 44% taking the contrary view. At the extremes of each group of respondents were 15% stating the job had been done very well compared with 16% who said it had been done very badly. No meaningful variations are noted in these data by age, gender, education or occupation. Of the complainants on the national rail services, 17% considered their complaint had been dealt with very well, and with twice this number (35%) saying it had been done fairly well, constituted a majority (52%) of this group who were satisfied with complaint-handling by the operators of rail services between towns and cities in their countries. This figure is 8 percentage points ahead of the 44% saying their complaint had been dealt with badly. Once again, no clear patterns emerged on the socio-demographic element of this relatively small group. Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 46 ",
        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 47 ATTITUDES OF CONSUMER PROTECTION In the same Eurobarometer survey (65.3), virtually three times (60%) as many EU citizens believed consumer interests relating to transport services in towns were well protected compared with just 21% taking the opposite view and this positive view rises to 85% in Greece (see Figure 2.40). Citizens of Luxembourg held strong views in this area and 22% of them compared with an EU average of just 9% said consumer interests were very well protected with regard to local transport services. Lithuanians (30%) and Spaniards (29%) had a very high 'don't know' factor on this issue compared with an EU-25 average of 19%. Among Italians, 35% thought that consumer interests were badly protected in this service area compared with an EU- 25 average of just 21%. Relatively high figures of 28% were also noted in Germany and Malta. Of the youngest age-group, 66% of them compared with 57% of those aged 55 or more, felt that consumer interests were well protected in respect of transport services within towns or cities. There was also an increase in this positive view as education levels rose with figures of 55% amongst those educated to age 15 or less and 61% amongst those educated to age 20 or beyond. While just 52% of the self- employed felt consumer interests were well protected, this figure rises to 67% of students. As might be anticipated, due to the relative paucity of local transport services in rural areas, just 55% of those living in villages said consumer interests were well protected compared with two thirds (65%) of those living in large towns. 4% 5% 5% 7% 7% 7% 7% 8% 8% 9% 9% 10% 10% 10% 11% 11% 11% 13% 14% 16% 17% 17% 18% 19% 22% 9% 42% 59% 50% 54% 56% 43%48% 47% 48% 48% 52%57% 47% 50% 45% 36% 61% 52%57% 51% 57% 61% 68% 45% 54% 50% 20% 18% 14% 11%17% 25% 14% 18%20% 21% 10% 22% 9% 10% 13% 8% 13% 13% 14% 11% 8% 12% 12% 13% 8% 16% 5% 3% 5%3% 3% 11% 3% 8% 7% 3% 5% 3% 3% 5% 4% 2% 2% 3% 2% 1% 2% 4% 3% 5% 29% 14% 26% 24%18% 15% 25% 15% 15% 26% 7% 30% 27% 27% 41% 13% 20%13% 20% 16%9% 19%13% 19% 2% 4% 1% 26% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ES SI HU PL LV IT EE PT DE MT FR SK LT IE SE CY CZ FI UK NL AT BE EL DK LU EU-25 Very well Fairly well Fairly badly Very badly Do not know F igure 2.40 In general, how well do you think consumers' interests are protected in respect of the transport services within towns/cities?

        "2. Transport Services 48 (cid:4) A majority of EU-25 citizens (55%) believe consumer interests are well protected in the domain of rail services between towns and cities (see Figure 2.41). However, this sentiment again appears to have certain reserves with 47% of those polled saying this protection was fairly good and just 8% saying it was very good. Greeks were particularly satisfied with the protection of consumer interests in this service: 81% of the Hellenic poll believes that these interests were well protected. Among Italians, however, only 43% hold this opinion. A high 'don't know' factor of 23% across the EU adds to the view that opinions on certain consumer issues are very much clustered in the middle ground. Older people and those with the least education were those who were least certain about this issue and both recorded figures of 29% in the 'don't know' category compared with an EU-25 average of 23%. As might be expected from this, a different set of figures is seen amongst the youngest age- group (15-24) and those educated to age 20 or beyond. Both these groups returned a lower figure of 19% in the 'don't know' category. While no socio-demographic patterns were observed generally when the data relating to those who thought that consumer interests were badly protected, variations are seen amongst the 55% taking the contrary view and believing consumer interests were well-protected in the area of rail services. Accordingly, just 51% of those aged 55 or more had this positive view compared with 62% of those aged 15 to 24. A similar divide was seen amongst the least educated (49%) compared with figures of 56% of those educated to age 20 or beyond and an even larger 63% amongst those still studying. When looking at respondents' occupation, it was seen that a relatively small percentage of self-employed (47%) and house persons (49%) compared with 59% of white-collar workers and 63% of students thought that consumer interests were well protected. There was also a noticeable variation by respondents' location with 59% of those living in large towns believing that consumer interests were well protected compared with just 50% of those living in rural villages. 4% 4% 4% 5% 5% 5% 6% 7% 8% 8% 9% 9% 9% 10% 10% 11% 11% 12% 13% 16% 17% 18% 20% 8% 46% 43% 38% 45% 37% 30% 57% 41% 52% 45% 41% 37% 45% 71% 57% 50%55% 53% 49% 59% 44% 53% 51% 47% 13% 15% 19% 13% 28% 8% 17% 15% 11% 21% 11% 5% 9% 11% 14% 11% 17% 13% 15% 11% 11% 10% 7% 17% 5% 3% 5%3% 5% 3% 2% 4% 10% 4% 3% 4% 2% 2% 2% 4% 4% 3% 2% 2% 3% 6% 100% 100% 32% 36% 34% 33% 51% 18% 35% 25%17% 35% 46% 33% 5% 18% 27% 14% 19% 20%12% 17% 19% 23% 12% 3% 17% 24% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% MT CY HU LV ES PL IT EE SI PT FR DE SE LT IE EL CZ FI SK UK NL BE DK AT LU EU-25 Very well Fairly well Fairly badly Very badly Do not know F igure 2.41 In general, how well do you think consumers' interests are protected in respect of the rail services between towns/cities?

        "2. Transport Services (cid:4) 49 TRANSPORT SAFETY Measuring transport risk - and comparing it with other countries - is not clear-cut, for there are different ways of measuring it. One method is to simply count the number of accidents and divide by the total population, to arrive at, for example, the number of deaths per million inhabitants. But while the mortality-population ratio cancels out countries' respective population differences, it does not reflect the actual usage or transport performance of the transport mode. For example, one train accident resulting in a hundred deaths in a very small country would give a very high ratio of deaths per million inhabitants, but if only 10% of the population use the train and for short journeys, this does not say much about the relative safety of rail travel, compared with say the car. Linking the number of deaths with the distance travelled serves as a better measure in this respect: the unit of measure representing the transport of one passenger over a distance of one kilometer. This said, when it comes to making comparisons with air transport, reliable statistics on passenger kilometres in air traffic are scarce. What is more, even if reliable pkm figures were obtainable, the picture would nevertheless be distorted since only a few accidents happen during the cruising phase; most happen at take-off and during the initial climb or during the final approach and landing. Long- haul flights are therefore not noticeably more dangerous than short-haul flights A problem linked to road traffic fatalities is the differentiation between passenger, driver and even also third party deaths (such as a pedestrian crossing the road, for example). For a passenger faced with choosing between one transport mode or the other, data based on passenger deaths are probably the most valuable. This said, transport safety has greatly improved in recent decades. The number of fatalities has been falling since 1970 for all modes of transport service, both in relative and absolute terms, despite the considerable rise in traffic. Nevertheless, more than 44 thousand persons have lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2004, the overwhelming majority in road accidents (see Table 2.42). ) s t i n u ( s e i t i l a t a F ) 1 ( s e n i l r i A 6 ) 2 ( s y a w l i a R 4 8 ) 3 ( d a o R 6 5 5 3 4 s t r o p s n a r t r e t a W 9 8 5 F igure 2.42 Fatalities by mode of transport in the EU, 2004 Source : Energy and Transport in Figures, Directorate-General of the European Commission for Energy and Transport (1 ) Onboard fatalities only.

        "2. Transport Services 50 (cid:4) Road safety much improved, despite higher transport performance Today, road are without doubt safer than a few decades ago. Better road design, higher standards for obtaining driver's license, stricter standards in vehicle's technical inspection and especially safer vehicles (both active and passive safety) explain a generally positive development. Public awareness for safe vehicles was notably raised by the activities of the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro-NCAP), an independent organisation specialised in the assessment of the safety of passenger cars through various crash tests. Established in 1997 and backed by five European Governments, the European Commission and motoring and consumer organisations in every EU country, Euro-NCAP has become a catalyst for encouraging significant safety improvements to new car design. Keeping in mind the focus on services of general interest, official statistics often do not allow for a separation of road fatalities according to the specific vehicle (i.e. bus or coach, taxi). Linking the number of deaths with the distance travelled (measured in fatalities per billion pkm) air transport reveals as the safest mode of transport in 2003/04, followed by railways. 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 4 1 0 6 1 5 0 0 2 4 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 9 9 9 1 8 9 9 1 7 9 9 1 6 9 9 1 r o t a r e p o y n a y b y r o t i r r e t 5 2 - U E r e v o s t n e d i c c a n i s m i t c i V e r e h w y n a s r o t a r e p o 5 2 - U E y b s t n e d i c c a n i s m i t c i V F igure 2.43 Victims in aviation accidents (1 ) Source : Energy and Transport in Figures, Directorate-General of the European Commission for Energy and Transport (1 ) Onboard fatalities only. Figure 2.43 shows the number of air accident fatalities both over EU territory (regardless of whether the operator was registered in the EU or not) and resulting from accidents anywhere in the world involving EU operators. This is an important distinction, given that the planes flying over are from EU and non-EU countries. Such information can feed into measures taken to increase air safety, such as for example setting stringent safety standards for EU air carriers or for banning non-EU carriers that fail EU requirements. Indeed, decisive steps towards enhancing European air safety and passenger protection was taken in early 2006 with a measure which allows the European Commission to keep European airspace free from airlines and aircraft considered to be unsafe. The Commission has provided online a regularly updated list of airlines considered to be unsafe and therefore not permitted to transfer passengers or cargo in the EU or operate within European airspace. It is expected that the black list will encourage all airlines operating in Europe to comply fully with safety standards and will dissuade unscrupulous airlines from starting up services in or to the EU. From Figure 2.43 it can be seen for instance that in 1997, 2001 and 2002 the number of deaths over EU-25 territory (from accidents connected with EU and non-EU carriers) exceeded those of deaths linked with EU-25 carriers operating anywhere in the world (including over EU territory). The 2000 death toll, for example, can largely be explained by the Concorde crash close to Paris; that of 2005 by the crash of a Cypriot aircraft in Greece Train passengers only a minority in rail transport accidents Turning to rail accident fatalities, It should be noted that the minority of rail accident fatalities are actually passengers travelling in trains. Most fatalities involving railways are recorded in accidents occurring at railway level crossings and in shunting procedures as well as track maintenance works. In such accidents, passengers travelling in the trains rarely die (see Figure 2.44). Chapter2_Draft_260207.qxp 25/09/2007 15:31 Page 50 ",

        "2. Transport Services 52 (cid:4) Heavy death tolls in very occasional ferry accidents Accidents involving maritime passenger transport are rare. Almost all fatalities among the 589 counted in 2004 (see Table 2.42) occurred in accidents with fishing and cargo vessels. Reliable data on the number of deaths occurring in maritime passenger transport operations are not easy to obtain: a situation that can be explained by the flags of convenience, a practice whereby many EU ship operators register vessels in non-EU registers. Very occasionally however, large accidents happen in EU waters: the Herald of Free Enterprise , a roll-on roll-off car and passenger ferry sank in March 1987, just outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, killing 193 passengers. In September 2000, the Express Samina ferry drifted off course and struck the rocks of an Islet, off the shores of Paros Island (Greece) causing it to sink. Of the 540 passengers, 79 lost their lives. The most severe accidents in recent history remains the loss of the ferry Estonia in 1994 in which 852 lives were lost in the Baltic Sea. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) contributes to the enhancement of the overall maritime safety system in the Community. Its goals are, through its tasks, to reduce the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution from ships and the loss of human lives at sea.

        "3. Energy and Water 56 (cid:4) In today's economic and social environment, living without energy is hardly possible. Modern societies cannot conceive existing without energy and water supply, even for a limited time. Recent electricity blackouts have shown that disruptions instantly and severely affect our daily life. The lack of electricity often impacts on the availability of other essential services, such as water supply, for those citizens who depend on the delivery of electricity to pumping water. More than a third of expenditure on electricity for energy and water at EU level One of the largest shares of household consumption of services of general interest is dedicated to energy and water. Indeed EU-15 households devoted, on average, around 1 397 PPS per annum to water, electricity, gas and other fuels. In absolute terms, households spent an average of between 882 PPS (Portugal) and 2 220 PPS (Denmark) per annum to heat their home, operate household appliances and use running water (see Figure 3.1). Electricity generally accounted for the largest proportion of spending, exceeding 35% of the expenditure on the items covered within this chapter at EU-15 level, water supply and services accounting for more than one-fourth of EU-15 expenditure and the rest being more or less equally distributed between gas and other fuels. However, certain Member States like France, Spain and Portugal had a higher share in electricity spending due to heating installations (for climatic reasons, a full central heating installation is often not necessary and electric heaters suffice to heat homes during cold days). For instance, it is estimated that 30 % of dwellings in France are equipped with electric heating. Ireland and the United Kingdom also had high shares in spending on electricity, but low shares for water supply and services (accounting for less than 10% of the expenditure on the items considered - see Figure 3.2).

        "(cid:4) 57 3. Energy and Water Households were one of the major final energy consumers in the EU, accounting for 26.4% of total energy consumption in 2004 (which can be compared to 28.0% for industrial use) - see Figure 3.3. Since 1960, the share of transport (road, rail, inland navigation and aviation) of total final energy consumption has been steadily increasing. At the beginning of the 1990s, it overtook the share of industry and reached 30.7% in 2004 (1960: 17%). As can be seen in Table 3.4, in 2004 road transport alone accounted for almost 290 million 'tonnes of oil equivalent' (toe) at EU level, corresponding to 25% of the EU's total final energy consumption. Within the transport sector (excluding international maritime transport and pipelines), road transport's share was close to 83% in 2004 (1960: 57%). Air transport accounted for 13% (1960: 7%), rail transport stood at 3% (1960: 31%) and transport via inland waterways at 1% (1960: 5%). The lower part of Table 3.4 reveals that energy consumption per inhabitant was the highest in Luxembourg in 2004 with 9 698 kgoe per inhabitant, whereas Lithuania and Malta had the lowest rates of energy consumption per capita (respectively 1 246 and 1 136 kgoe per inhabitant). 3.1 HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION Per capita energy consumption highest in Luxembourg F igure 3.3 Final energy consumption in the EU, 2004 (all products) (% of toe) (1 ) (1 ) Provisional values.

Energy and Water Whereas Table 3.4 supplies details on the final energy consumption regardless of the 'energy product', Figure 3.5 is limited to the final electricity consumption of households in 2004, expressed in GWh (Gigawatt/hour) per 1 000 inhabitants. At EU-25 level, a consumption of 1.7 GWh was calculated (EU-15: 1.8 GWh). Sweden and Finland show a consumption that is two to three times higher, explained by the fact that the most common form of heating in detached houses in these countries is electricity (relatively cheap to install and simple to run). In apartment buildings, district heating systems are increasingly common. Moreover, the climatic conditions in the Nordic countries take consumption up to high levels. Conversely, consumption in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia reached only one third of the EU average.

Gas use in Sweden and Finland is generally restricted to the localities of old cities with previously existing town gas networks but the vast majority of domestic consumers do not have access to it. This results in low average consumption figures: together with Greece, where the natural gas distribution network is basically limited to densely populated areas of Athens, Thessaloniki and Thessalia, Sweden and Finland are the countries with the lowest per capita consumption. In countries where the gas network is quite developed, average consumption can be more than double the EU-25 average (established at 11.8 Terajoules per 1 000 inhabitants).

        "3. Energy and Water 60 (cid:4) European households consumed 301 million toe of energy in 2004, which was 17.5% more than in 1990. European households relied on three types of fuel for almost three quarters of their energy needs - apart from natural gas (38.6%), the most important products in the energy mix were electricity (21.9%) and gas/diesel oil (13.9%). During the 1990's households changed their energy mix, switching from solid fuels and petroleum products to natural gas and (to a lesser extent) electricity - see Figure 3.7. The share of natural gas of the total energy consumed by EU-25 households in 2004 was some 6 percentage points more than in 1994. Whilst natural gas and electricity consumption increased between 1994 and 2004 (reaching 116.1 million toe and 65.8 million toe respectively), gas/diesel oil consumption fell to 41.8 million toe. Within the Member States, there was a low level of natural gas used in households in Finland, Sweden and Greece (with respective shares of 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.7% of total energy consumption in 2004). In certain countries, the share of gas could be slightly higher, as other types of gas (butane, propane) may also be used. However, these gases are bottled or stored in stand-alone tanks and are not part of a network industry and hence not considered here. Renewable fuels played a small role in the energy mix, but displayed one of the highest growth rates during the 1990s: for example, solar energy consumption grew by an average of 12.4% per annum between 1994 and 2004.

        "(cid:4) 61 3. Energy and Water Comparing natural gas, electricity and heating gas oil, electricity seems to be a more comfortable source of energy for households for heating and cooking. It is indeed an easy source of energy, implying lower infrastructural costs and less danger than natural gas. However, despite these advantages, electricity remains far more expensive than natural gas. At least for heating purposes, gas oil offers an alternative to natural gas as the price level is globally comparable.In some countries the price of gas oil for heating was less than the price of natural gas in 2006 (see Table 3.19). Most of the dwellings in the EU are equipped with space and water heating using natural gas. A Eurobarometer survey (65.3) on consumers' opinions of services of general interest in 2006 showed that 72% of the people questioned considered that they had easy access to gas supply services 1 ; 9% had difficult access and 15% no access (see Table 3.9). Difficult access to gas supply services was most often mentioned in Finland (21%), in Slovenia (18%), in Lithuania (17%), in Italy and in Poland (both 16%), as opposed to Denmark (5%), Netherlands (5%), Austria (5%) and Ireland (4%).

Data regarding energy amenities shows that four fifths (84.4%) of European households were living in dwellings with central heating, whilst almost all (96.2%) households had hot running water in 2001 2 - see Figure 3.10. To a certain extent, variations between Member States can be explained as a result of climatic differences (there is often less or no need for heating in southern Member States) and general income levels, differences also occur due to the penetration of alternative heating systems. For example, the relatively low percentage of Danish and Finnish households without central heating reflects the importance of district heating in these countries. The proportion of dwellings in the EU-15 without central heating or hot water was higher when the tenant was inactive or unemployed (28.1% and 3.9% respectively in 1998).

        "(cid:4) 63 3. Energy and Water Whilst public awareness of the environmental impact of energy use in the industrial and transport sectors is high, the same cannot always be said for air emissions that result from energy consumption within households. Public perception of emissions is often influenced by the distance between energy generation and energy use. For example, a heating boiler in the cellar of a house may smell or smoke when combusting oil, whilst district heated households are clearly separated from their energy source. A shift towards sustainable energy consumption patterns and therefore changes in lifestyle can be expected in the future, with energy prices increasingly likely to reflect environmental costs. In fact, the willingness to make some efforts, in terms of expense and consumption, in order to face the new energy challenges societies are tackling, has been the topic of a Eurobarometer survey (64.2) conducted in all EU-25 Member States in autumn 2005. Two different questions were used with this purpose in mind: half of the sample in each country was asked whether they would be prepared to pay more for energy produced from renewable sources ('Would you be prepared to pay more for energy produced from renewable sources than for energy produced from other sources? If yes, how much would you be prepared to pay?' - see Table 3.11), while the rest answered a similar question but formulated differently ('As you may know, we are now facing new energy challenges (like high energy prices, international obligations to reduce CO2 emissions) that could imply efforts from citizens. With which of the following propositions do you agree the most?' [first two propositions] - see Table 3.12). Both questions prove that people are reluctant to pay more. However a significant percentage (40%), most likely individuals who are more sensitive to environmental issues, would be prepared to pay somewhat more for energy from renewable sources (see Table 3.11). An even higher price rise with an increase of 5% and 13% would be accepted by 27 %. Yet the country-to-country analysis reveals the existence of significant differences as far as price-related efforts are concerned. Most probably linked to a difference in household incomes, a first cleavage is to be found amongst the old EU-15 Member States and the ten new Members, with the latter group being clearly more reluctant to pay higher prices for \u2018green energy\u2019, opposition to such a measure reaching 76% in Slovakia. Moreover, the existence of a market for \u2018green energy\u2019 amongst consumers appears to be more evident in northern Europe with countries such as Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland or the Netherlands being more willing to take action even if this involves an extra financial effort on their part in order to help the environment by consuming energy from renewable sources. In these countries, more than half of the population would be prepared to pay more for \u2018green energy\u2019. It is interesting to note that 56% of Germans are not prepared to pay more, although the country is the foremost producer of wind energy. While changing energy usage still generates a certain level of reluctance when it involves financial efforts, reducing energy consumption seems to be a realistic goal on a short-term basis. More than five out of ten Europeans would appear to be willing to reduce their energy consumption and 5% would make this change even if it implies paying more (see Table 3.12). On the other hand, more than one out of four would not reduce their energy consumption. Amongst this group, 12% state they would not change their habits in spite of a potential price increase. Citizens of Luxembourg, the Maltese and Dutch seem to be more prepared to change their practices in terms of energy use with almost seven out of ten citizens stating that they would reduce their energy consumption and therefore that they are not willing to pay more. The Danes appear to be most prepared to assume a price increase in order to maintain their habits while the Greeks and Hungarians are those most unwilling to make any change, either in terms of use or cost. A majority also shares this position in seven other countries, including Poland and Slovakia. It should be recalled that citizens in these countries proved to be especially reluctant to accept major changes in energy consumption (the use of renewable energy) due to its cost implication.

        "(cid:4) 65 3. Energy and Water Concerning the regulation of energy consumption, the Eurobarometer survey (64.2) also allows some results to be presented on the public authorities' measures to help people to reduce their energy consumption. Most European citizens (43%) would require more information on efficient use of energy, but also external steering in the form of tax incentives (40%) (see Table 3.13). The actions related to energy standards are seen to be slightly less effective, higher energy efficiency standards reaching a 32% share and more strict control over the current standards 21%. In most Member States (14 countries), increased distribution of information is rated as the priority for the public authorities. This is also the case in all the candidate and acceding countries. Citizens of 11 Member States assess the tax incentives as the best way to promote energy efficiency. Respondents in Cyprus (60%), Denmark (59%) and Malta (57%) are the first to appreciate the improvement of awareness by added information provided by the public authorities while the citizens of Sweden (62%) and the Czech Republic (59%) are the first to support the development of tax incentives.

        "3. Energy and Water 66 (cid:4) Energy consumption within the home is, in the short-term, a relatively inelastic expenditure item, as reactions to price fluctuations can often only be made through investment in new equipment. As energy consumption has risen, there has at the same time been an increase in energy- conserving items (such as double-glazing or insulation), as well as more frequent replacement of equipment (resulting in higher energy efficiency). In the last decade, it was mainly PC's that have entered households as new energy- consuming devices. European households (EU-15) spent between 2.9% (United Kingdom) and 6.8% (Denmark) of their total consumption expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuels in 1999 3 (see Table 3.42). Mean consumption expenditure for these items varied from 673 PPS per household in Spain to 1 604 PPS per household in Denmark. Electricity accounted for in excess of 42% of energy expenditure in the majority of the Member States in 1999, whilst Dutch and Italian households spent a higher proportion on gas (52.8% and 42.0%). Solid fuels accounted for more than a fifth (20.5%) of energy spending in Ireland and heat energy for more than a third (36.2%) in Denmark. With increasing income, the proportion of expenditure devoted to energy tends to decrease, because energy consumption does not increase once certain needs are covered (see Figure 3.14). Considering the link between rising income and a reduced share of energy in total expenditure, it was not surprising to find that households spending proportionally more on energy included those whose head was unemployed, retired or otherwise inactive. The degree of urbanisation was another important determinant, with households in rural areas more likely to spend proportionally more of their total budget on energy. The ratio of the share of energy in total expenditure for households in densely populated areas to that for households in sparsely populated areas was between 0.5 in Finland and 0.9 in the United Kingdom 4 (see Figure 3.15).

Investment in equipment is based upon price expectations in the future, as well as affordability (income) and choice (whether the chosen fuel network is established in the area). When energy prices rise, consumers may become more aware of their everyday consumption and try to avoid consuming excessive amounts of energy. Alternatively, consumers may look for energy-saving measures. It is generally agreed that consumers are more responsive to rising prices (asymmetric price elasticity) 5 . Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels displayed significant variations in price levels between Member States mainly because of countries with extreme price levels (see Table 3.19 on page 69): Danish households paid up to four times as much for their energy as households in Lithuania. The price of energy products has risen considerably since 2003, resulting in the harmonised consumer price index for energy overtaking the all-items index (see Figure 3.16 and Table 3.17). Between 2001 and 2005, the absolute change in energy prices varied between a 60.1% increase in Slovakia and a 7.6% increase in Lithuania. Only Romania and Turkey reached a higher value, increases of 138.5% and 105.3% respectively.

These absolute changes are strongly influenced by the evolution of prices between 2004 and 2005, when electricity prices increased by 3.7% and those of liquid fuels rose by as much as 27.9% (the latter reflecting the imbalance between supply and demand in crude oil markets). The ongoing process of liberalisation of electricity markets may well be influencing the trend of electricity prices. Taxes can be used to make energy prices higher, with the aim of influencing consumer choice. Taxation is regarded as a flexible instrument to encourage changes in consumption behaviour and, combined with subsidies, it can be used to stimulate a wider use of alternative energy products (in particular renewable energy sources). Energy taxes are justified on the grounds of external elements (such as air and water pollution or greenhouse gas emissions), following the polluter pays principle. Considering that the consumption of energy products is relatively inelastic, changes to taxation are normally made in progressive steps in order to give consumers time to adapt to the resulting price levels. The inelasticity of energy consumption is shown by a study 5 on the impact of existing fuel taxation on heating systems chosen by households, where it was found that central heating equipment using natural gas was cheaper, whether the price with or without excise duties is considered.

        "(cid:4) 69 3. Energy and Water Although the supply of heating gas oil cannot be considered as an SGI, it is interesting to compare the electricity and gas prices with those of heating gas oil. Table 3.19 shows the energy prices European households had to face at the beginning of 2006, with the applicable tax rates of the Member States shown in Table 3.20. The correlation between high taxes and high prices becomes obvious. For example, adding electricity taxes, the price of electricity more than doubled (136.9%) in Denmark, but resulted in a 5.0% increase in Malta and the United Kingdom. It should be borne in mind that the prices communicated are representative for the country and therefore take account of the ongoing liberalisation process. The tax burden consists of VAT, excise duties and other indirect environmental taxes. Several Member States applied reduced VAT rates to energy products, such as the United Kingdom or Portugal, whilst the Nordic countries applied their standard rates (see page 12 for a list of VAT rates applied to energy products). Excise duties applied to heating gas oil ranged from EUR 10.0 per thousand litres in Luxembourg to EUR 403.2 per thousand litres in Italy, with nine Member States reporting duties between EUR 40 and EUR 90 per thousand litres (as of July 2006).

Using a service and then paying for it can be viewed as a normal function but, in some cases, it creates a problem in that the user considers the price to be excessive or unaffordable. It is the consumer's belief that the service is sufficiently needed that overrides this price consideration. In an attempt to gauge affordability of services of general interest, a Eurobarometer survey (65.3), carried out in spring 2006, questioned users' affordability of electricity and gas supply networks across all EU-25 Member States.

Examples of these extremely small samples are just single- digit segments in Cyprus, Luxembourg, Sweden and Portugal. Half of this small segment across the European Union said that they could afford the price of electricity supply services. While 10% were unsure of costs in this area (i.e. gave a 'don't know' response), 27% said the price was not affordable and a further 12% said it was excessive.

A third of the poll did not know whether they could afford gas and this lack of knowledge of gas prices reaches 84% in Finland and 82% in Sweden.

        "3. Energy and Water 76 (cid:4) The pricing/tariff structure for electricity is dependent upon the degree of market opening, the number of utilities in an area and the time of day (as most networks have excess capacity during the night). Reliable electricity supply at acceptable prices is a key driver to economic growth and competitiveness. In order to benefit from efficient energy supply, the EU decided to bring the energy sector into line with the competitive parts of its economy by gradually introducing competition. Directive 2003/54/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity gave deadlines for the opening of the market: 1 July 2004 for all business customers and 1 July 2007 for households. Certain countries anticipated the liberalisation process; others are slower in adopting the necessary measures. Indicators obtained are mainly based on the results of a voluntary, questionnaire-based data collection aimed at monitoring competition in the electricity market. Table 3.26 outlines the state of progress of the liberalisation process and expresses the degree of market opening (first column). The latter should be understood as the share of electricity consumed by customers that have indeed a choice of electricity supplier (eligible consumers) in the total quantity of electricity consumed. By September 2005 full market liberalisation was completed in 10 Member States. Ireland was the latest country to reach full market opening in 2005. The eligibility threshold shows that for certain countries the freedom to choose supplier is still limited to non-household customers. In other countries the threshold is linked to consumption of a certain quantity, quantities that are not reached by household consumers.

        "(cid:4) 77 3. Energy and Water An electricity generator/ producer is not necessarily also a retailer. With regard to the sales of electricity to end consumers, the latter increasingly have the choice as market opening has clearly led to the creation of new retailers. EU legislation provides for a legal unbundling between the supply (production), the network activities (transmission and distribution) and the sales activities. Should this unbundling not have taken place, a newcomer to the market can get access to the distribution network to serve customers using the so-called Third Party Access rules. Derogations exist for small networks (less than 100 000 connected customers) or small isolated systems (i.e. islands). Although not applicable to all countries, it can be noted that the number of electricity retailers is generally highest where full liberalisation has already been achieved. Obviously the size of the country has an influence on the number of electricity retailers. Germany registered 940 retailers but only four reached a notable size (at least 5% of the total quantity of electricity supplied at national level). Similarly, 166 electricity retailers were counted in France, but only one could be considered as 'major'. The Czech Republic, Spain, Italy and Poland registered several hundred retailers. In 2004, Italy reported only one with a market share of at least 5%, in Spain there were three major retailers, in Poland five, whereas the Czech Republic counted eight retailers of notable size. Comparing the global situation of 2004 to that of a year earlier, the total number of retailers at EU-25 level (disregarding Finland, which could not supply precise data) decreased from 3 040 to 2 834. A certain consolidation appears to be taking place in various countries. Considerably fewer retailers were counted in Spain, Denmark, Austria and especially in the Czech Republic. Conversely, eight retailers more were registered in the United Kingdom, 10 more in Italy and 27 more in Poland. Looking at the number of major retailers in the individual Member States, significant changes between the two years were only observed for Spain, Italy and Poland. The number of customers switching suppliers may be an indicator as to the effectiveness of competition. In countries where they have the right to choose, electricity consumers remain reluctant to exercise their right to choose. Often, competing offers are unavailable or are too similar to constitute a real choice. Dominant positions and insufficient unbundling, especially at the distribution level, seem to discourage switching apart from the fact that changing suppliers is often perceived as risky.

        "3. Energy and Water 78 (cid:4) The Gas Directive 2003/55/EC is the key European legislation to establish the Internal Market for Gas. The directive had to be implemented by 1 July 2004. From July 2007 at the latest, all consumers will be free to choose their gas supplier. The current supplier should no longer be the only choice. The market for large consumers has been open for several years. For smaller commercial customers and households, market opening is rather recent or, in certain cases, not yet existent. Table 3.28 outlines the state of progress of the liberalisation process and expresses the degree of market opening as of September 2005. The market opening is defined as the percentage of the total natural gas consumed by those customers that are given the choice of their natural gas supplier (eligible consumers). In September 2005 full market liberalisation was completed in Denmark, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom. The eligibility threshold shows that for certain countries the freedom to choose supplier is still limited to non-household customers (households should have the choice of their retailers from July 2007 onwards).

        "(cid:4) 79 3. Energy and Water By July 2007, all customers should hence become eligible customers, i.e. have the possibility to choose the most attractive gas supplier. Table 3.29 shows the total number of gas retailers in the various Member States in 2004 (based on a voluntary, questionnaire-based data collection). It is recalled that a gas producer (or importer) does not necessarily have to be a retailer. Most retailers can be found in Germany; with 700 enterprises they outnumber the retailers in Italy (389, down from 412 in 2003) by a large margin. However, only one German enterprise has a market share of more than 5% of the total quantity of gas supplied at national level whereas in Italy, five enterprises responded to this criterion. Compared to a year earlier and among the 22 Member States for which information for both years is available, 10 registered an increase in the number of retailers, in five countries the number remained stable and in seven the number of retailers actually decreased. It was the UK that showed a noticeable reduction, from 23 suppliers in 2003 to 15 suppliers in 2004. Conversely, Poland registered seven additional gas suppliers, Belgium an additional five and Slovenia an additional four. The sometimes considerable number of suppliers to final customers however masks the fact that only few retailers are of considerable size (above the threshold of 5% market share): a maximum of seven suppliers were registered in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom and five Member States reported only a single major supplier in 2004. In Belgium and Lithuania, the number of major retailers was reduced by one entity. The markets of Denmark, Greece, Spain and Luxembourg saw one additional major retailer; those of Austria and the UK an additional two. In general, it should be kept in mind that a high number of retailers and a relatively high number of enterprises that hold at least 5% of the total quantity distributed on the national market does not necessarily mean that there is a certain degree of competition in the country. The gas market can be split by a number of regional distributors where the customer does not have the real choice of a supplier. The number of customers switching may be an indicator of the effectiveness of competition. In countries or regions where they have the right to choose, gas consumers remain reluctant to exercise this right. Competing offers are often unavailable. Also, changing suppliers is often perceived as risky.

        "3. Energy and Water 80 (cid:4) The consumer satisfaction survey on services of general interest undertaken by IPSOS/INRA for the Directorate- General of the European Commission for Health and Consumer Protection in 2006 provides information on consumer satisfaction in relation to electricity and gas distribution services. For the survey, consumers were defined as people aged at least 18 years old and having used the service during the past 12 months. Satisfaction was defined as the consumer's assessment of a product or service in terms of the extent to which that product or service has met his/her needs or expectations. Consumer satisfaction was to be measured both directly (\u2018observed satisfaction\u2019) as through statistical processing of responses to specific questions (\u2018calculated satisfaction\u2019). The questionnaire used for the survey mainly consists in the evaluation of several aspects of seven topics (overall satisfaction and expectations, quality, price, image, market and personal factors, complaints and commitment) by using a 10-point scale. The objective was to achieve consistency of the rating scales across countries and sectors. Electricity supply services: higher satisfaction levels in the new Member States European consumers are fairly satisfied with electricity supply: the average score at EU-25 level is 7.6 (on a scale from 1 to 10). In comparison with the other services of general interest, the electricity supply comes in a middle position (7th place). This applies both to the EU-15 countries as the new Member States (NMS). When looking at the proportion of satisfied and dissatisfied respondents , a more important difference between EU-15 and NMS10 countries can be observed (see Table 3.30). Compared to EU-15, there are relatively more satisfied consumers in the new Member States (62%) but also relatively more dissatisfied consumers (7% of respondents). This result may suggest that consumers from the new Member States pay more attention to this service than the EU-15 consumers. It could also point out to higher differences in quality and/or perception levels within these countries. At country level, the proportion of satisfied consumers ranges from 35% (Italy) to 82% (Lithuania). The standard deviation around the average (58%) is about 14%. Based on the proportion of satisfied consumers, three country groups emerge: - A first group includes the countries where the proportion of satisfied consumers is meaningfully 10 higher than the EU-25 average. In descending order these are: Lithuania, Austria, Denmark, Slovenia, Ireland, Latvia, Germany, Hungary, Estonia, Luxemburg, Cyprus, Belgium and Finland. One can observe that most of the New Member States (6 out of the 10) are in this first group. - The second group covers the countries where the proportion of satisfied consumers is not significantly different from the EU-25 average: France, Poland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Sweden. - The last group contains the countries where the proportion of satisfied consumers is significantly lower than the EU-25 average: Slovakia, Greece, Malta, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy. In Portugal and Italy less than 40% of consumers declare to be satisfied with the electricity supply. The survey results also show that the proportion of dissatisfied consumers in Malta, Portugal and Sweden exceeds 10% (it is even 17% in Malta). At the other side of the spectrum, in Lithuania, Austria, Belgium, Luxemburg, Denmark, Germany and Slovenia less than 3% of consumers stated to be dissatisfied.

        "(cid:4) 81 3. Energy and Water Table 3.31 displays the proportion of satisfied and dissatisfied consumers for different socio-economic groups. In relation to occupation, it illustrates the following results: - Satisfaction levels do not differ significantly between managers (62%), retired consumers (61%) and blue collar workers (60%): the proportions of satisfied consumers in these professional categories are slightly higher than the EU-25 average (58%). - There is no statistically significant difference between the proportions of satisfied respondents among unemployed people (59%), white collar workers (57%), students (55%) and EU-25 average. One can observe, however, that the proportion of dissatisfied consumers is the highest with unemployed consumers (9%). - The lowest proportions of satisfied consumers (slightly higher than 50%) are found with self-employed and house persons. The education level seems to be correlated somewhat with satisfaction. Statistical analysis shows that there is a statistically significant difference between the respondents who completed secondary education (equally satisfied compared to the EU-25 average) and those who did not (significantly less satisfied). Regarding the age, in line with the finding of the higher satisfaction level of the retired people, people older than 55 years are significantly more satisfied (60%) than the other categories and than the EU-25 average. The classes from 18 to 34 and from 35 to 54 show proportions similar to the EU-25 average. Statistically speaking, there is no difference between the proportion of satisfied consumers amongst men and women.

        "3. Energy and Water 82 (cid:4) In Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Ireland, more than 7 consumers out of 10 consider their electricity provider as having an overall positive image (for an EU-25 average of 51%). They are only 28% in the Netherlands, 31% in Portugal and Malta, 33% in Italy, 35% in Spain and Sweden to think so. For the majority of EU-25 consumers (57%), their electricity provider offers a quality service. Austrians are the most satisfied consumers as far as the overall quality of electricity distribution is concerned (80% of consumers state to be satisfied). Price is rated lower than quality and image among EU citizens, whether in the EU-15 or in NMS10. Only 35% of them said their provider's prices are fair given the services provided. Luxembourg, Slovenia, Finland and Germany are the only countries where an absolute majority (from 50% to 52%) agrees with this statement. In countries where the market for electricity distribution is liberalised, i.e. in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, a large majority of consumers has no intention to change supplier in the short run (within the year). The only exception to this pattern is Belgium where only 46% declare to be committed to their supplier. More than 8 consumers out of 10 prefer to deal with a national electricity provider. The same proportion thinks that the services of these providers are available for everybody and everywhere. In liberalised markets, almost two thirds of consumers think there is enough competition, so that they can get what they want from their electricity provider without having to be afraid of getting less quality. In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands this idea is shared by respectively 84% and 77% of users, whereas they are only 28% to think so in the Czech Republic. However, when speaking of changing their provider, consumers in liberalised markets are less convinced about the fact that this could be easy to do: 54% believe there are no barriers. The Czechs, Danes, Austrians and Belgians are the least convinced: respectively 18%, 22%, 35% and 36% of the persons polled believing it is easy to change supplier. Finally, only 23% of EU consumers think it is possible to buy from an electricity supplier outside their country. A majority (41%) could not give an answer. Majority thinks consumers' interest are well protected The Eurobarometer survey (65.3) on consumers' opinions of services of general interest in 2006 revealed that 62% of EU-25 citizens think that consumers' interests are well protected with respect to electricity supply services (see Table 3.32). Particularly high proportions were registered in Denmark and Luxembourg (both at 77%), Belgium and the United Kingdom (both at 78%) and especially Austria (80%). Conversely, in Germany, 43% of those polled believe that consumer' interests are badly protected compared with an EU-25 average of 26%. High 'don't know' figures of 26% were noted in Spain - more than twice the EU-25 average of 12%.

        "(cid:4) 83 3. Energy and Water Gas supply services: greatest differences most among services of general interest European consumers are fairly satisfied with the gas supply: the average score at EU-25 level is 7.6 on a scale from 1 to 10. In comparison with the other services of general interest, the gas supply comes in sixth position. Consumers in the new Member States are slightly more satisfied than in EU-15. Table 3.33 shows that both the proportions of satisfied consumers and the proportions of dissatisfied consumers are higher in the ten new Member States (considered as a group). In most of these countries fewer consumers take a \u2018neutral\u2019 position. This finding is similar to the results regarding electricity supply There are fifteen countries where the proportion of satisfied consumers is clearly above the EU-25 average. In the descending order these are first of all Greece, Lithuania and Ireland, with very high numbers of satisfied consumers (ranging from 82 to 87%). These countries are followed by Denmark, Slovenia, Finland, Austria, and Sweden (from 74 to 78%) and finally Germany, Luxembourg, Estonia, Latvia, Belgium, Hungary and the Czech Republic (from 64 to 70%). As for electricity, six of the ten new Member States are within this group. In only three countries the proportion of satisfied consumers is not statistically different from the EU-25 average: Poland (59%), the United Kingdom (58%) and France (58%). One can deduce from this that gas supply is the service of general interest where consumer satisfaction differs most across European countries. The countries with the lowest numbers of satisfied consumers are Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovakia (from 43% to 49%). Again, the low figure for Italy should be noted (36%). The highest numbers of dissatisfied consumers are found in three new Member States: Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary with respectively 15%, 10% and 9%. Remarkably, the Czech Republic and Hungary have also relatively high proportions of satisfied consumers. T able 3.33 Overall, to what extent are you satisfied with your gas supplier?

        "3. Energy and Water 84 (cid:4) When considering the different socio-economic groups, it appears that managers (62%) and house persons (61%) are the most satisfied regarding gas supply (see Table 3.34). These groups precede the retired, the white collars, the blue collars and the unemployed (from 56% to 60%), where the satisfaction is not significantly different from the EU-25 average, and finally the students and self-employed (51%), clearly under the average. Yet, even in these groups the proportion of consumers that are really dissatisfied remains low (around 6%), in particular when compared with other services of general interest. Like for the electricity supply service, satisfaction levels do not differ significantly between the respondents who have been studying until the age of 16 or later (around 59%). But again, respondents that have been at school until the age of 15 (or less) are somewhat less satisfied (55% are satisfied). Finally, the consumers who are still studying are the least satisfied (48%). When looking at age groups, the respondents up to 55 year old are clearly the most satisfied consumers - 60% of them rated their satisfaction equal to or greater then 8/10. Satisfaction levels by gender show no differences. T able 3.34 Overall, to what extent are you satisfied with your gas supplier?

        "(cid:4) 85 3. Energy and Water In Greece, Ireland, Slovenia, Luxembourg and Finland, more than 7 consumers out of 10 consider their gas provider as having an overall positive image (for an EU-25 average of 49%). They are only 25% in Slovakia, 30% in Italy, 32% in the Netherlands and 39% in Portugal and Spain to think so. For the majority of EU-25 consumers (59%), their gas provider offers a quality service. Greeks are the most satisfied consumers as far as the overall quality of gas distribution is concerned (88% of \u2018satisfied\u2019 consumers). For a small share of EU citizens, whether in the EU-15 or in NMS10, the provider's prices are considered fair, given the services rendered. In Slovakia, this proportion is the lowest (16%). Luxembourg, Finland, Lithuania, Ireland, Slovenia and Greece, on the other hand, are the only countries where an absolute majority (from 51% to 63%) agrees with this statement. More than eight consumers out of ten who have a choice between several gas suppliers (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Spain, Greece, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) will keep their supplier in the next 12 months. Almost 8 EU consumers out of 10 prefer to deal with national gas providers. Their services are available for everybody and everywhere, according to 68% of EU gas users and especially in the New Member States (75%, against 67% in EU-15). In addition, when asked whether they think it is possible to buy gas distribution services from a supplier outside their country, a majority could not give an answer (40%) and 38% answered negatively. In liberalised markets, while 87% of Britons, 79% of Portuguese and 67% of Dutch people agree with the fact that in their country there is enough competition, 78% of French people and 74% of Slovaks do not. Speaking of changing provider, EU consumers in liberalised markets are quite divided: 42% believe there are no barriers, especially in the EU-15 (43%, against 22% in the NMS10). Results in the United Kingdom (80%) and Portugal (79%) show the greatest proportion of people agreeing with this statement. The same proportion disagrees with this statement, especially in France (76%) and in Slovakia (71%). Consumers' interests perceived as well protected especially in the Netherlands and the UK. The Eurobarometer survey (65.3) on consumers' opinions of services of general interest in 2006 revealed that shows that just over half (51%) of EU-25 citizens think that consumer interests are well protected in the area of gas supply. With a high figure of 71%, the Dutch and the British excel. Indeed, among all the Member States, these two countries feature an extensive gas distribution network; operated routinely for decades. Citizens' views on he protection of consumer interests for gas supply networks are generally not very strongly held on either a positive or negative basis: only 8% of the poll said these interests were very well protected and a similar 6% said they were very badly protected. The great majority of opinion tends to the middle-ground with 43% of those polled saying that this protection was 'fairly well' provided. This lack of conviction shown is reinforced by the fact that 26% of this poll gave 'don't know' as an answer. The high figure for Sweden (91%) and Finland (76%) in this respect is probably due to the low coverage of the gas supply network in this country.

        "3. Energy and Water 86 (cid:4) Water is a limited natural resource on which human health and development depends; in return human activities have an impact on this resource. The effects of climate change happening will further aggravate the situation in terms of quality and availability of this resource in many regions. European water policies place great attention on water quality, whether for drinking or other purposes, and Community legislation in these areas basically dates from the 1970s and 1980s. In 2000, a long-term framework for Community action in the field of water policy was established with broader aims, including the promotion of sustainable water use. Notably this framework promotes a gradual implementation of the use of pricing, alongside other measures, as incentives for consumers to modify their consumption patterns towards a sustainable level with the aim of recovering the full costs of water services. These water pricing policies should be implemented by 2010. A special Eurobarometer Survey on the Environment published in April 2005 showed that from the consumers' point of view, water is the environment sector most close to citizens hearts and minds - in all EU-25 Member States. Furthermore, the same survey revealed that an overwhelming majority of citizens (between 74% and 95%, EU-25 average of 85%) demands from politicians that they consider protection of the environment as important as economic and social policy. 3.2 HOUSEHOLD WATER CONSUMPTION AND SUPPLY The water required for drinking and other domestic purposes is a significant proportion of the total water demand. The proportion of water for abstracted urban use ranges from about 6.5% in Germany to more than 50% in the United Kingdom. Population distribution and density are key factors influencing the availability of water resources. Increased urbanisation concentrates water demand and can lead to the over-exploitation of local water resources. Higher standards of living are changing water demand patterns. This is reflected mainly in increased domestic water use, especially for personal hygiene. Virtually the entire European population has indoor toilets, showers and/or baths for daily use. The result is that most of urban water consumption is for domestic use. Most of the water use in households is for toilet flushing (33%), bathing and showering (20-32%), and for washing machines and dishwashers (15%). The proportion of water used for cooking and drinking (3%) is minimal compared to the other uses. Despite unreliable water supply, the level of domestic water consumption in Europe is high. The leakage in pipes is quite high and is often counted as consumption. Figure 3.36 shows that average water consumption per person and day is high in several southern Member States and several Nordic countries; Spain and Portugal, as well as the United Kingdom and France, all record average daily consumption in excess of 160 litres per person, whilst consumption in more centrally located countries and the Baltic Member States was below this level 12 . Table 3.37 shows that basic water-consuming amenities, such as running hot water, indoor flushing toilets or baths or showers are available in more than 90% of the dwellings in nearly every EU-15 Member State. Most households also have a washing machine (see Table 3.38). In most Western European Member States, the share is 90% or higher, a notable exception being Denmark and Sweden, where a fairly substantial number of households is not equipped. The reason for not having a washing machine is in most cases not linked to affordability.

One of the most obvious environmental impacts of the household use of water is the generation of waste water. Table 3.39 shows that in most EU Member States around three quarters of dwellings are connected to public sewerage systems, with only Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia falling below this level. A clear gradient can be observed between the EU-15 countries and the new Member States. In the Accession Treaty, the latter group of countries have been granted a clear and unambiguous transition period, staged from 2005 to 2015. In the Nordic countries, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom, all public sewerage involves treatment. At the other extreme, in Malta, 87% of dwellings are connected to a public sewerage system where waste water is still not treated. However, these data are from 2001 and the situation in Malta has considerably improved since then.

        "3. Energy and Water 88 (cid:4) The use of pricing to promote sustainable water use, as foreseen in the earlier mentioned framework Directive for Community action in the field of water policy, presumes that users must pay in relation to their level of consumption and pollution. It also implies that users must pay a price that covers environmental costs and the depletion of limited resources, as well as the operating and investment costs of the distribution infrastructure. As an example of the price structure, one may cite the basic structure of pricing in France that dates from 1964 and is based on the 'polluter pays' principle. Table 3.40 shows the increasing proportion of an average bill accounted for by water treatment and other charges including specific taxes used to contribute to a sustainable management of water resources. Harmonised consumer price indices show that water prices have risen each year in the EU-25 between 2001 and 2005. Up until 2005, price increases for water exceeded (in percentage terms) the rise seen in the all-items consumer price index (see Figure 3.41). Over the period 2001 to 2005, the consumer price index for water rose in all of the EU Member States 13 especially for Ireland and Slovakia, where it increased by as much as 127% and 142% respectively.

        "(cid:4) 89 3. Energy and Water In 2006, a consumer satisfaction survey 14 looked at consumer satisfaction with the water distribution as one of eleven services of general interest. For the most part, the questionnaire used for the survey consisted in the evaluation of several aspects of seven topics (overall satisfaction and expectations, quality, price, image, market and personal factors, complaints and commitment) by using a 10-point scale. The objective was to achieve consistency of the rating scales across countries and sectors. As regards water distribution, there are small differences in the average satisfaction levels between EU-15 and the 10 new Member States, but these differences are not statistically significant. Compared to the other services, water distribution ranks in fifth position and is the first of the three utility services (together with gas and electricity supply). When comparing satisfactions levels 15 between EU-15 and the 10 new Member States, statistical analysis shows that, as a group: - there are no statistically significant differences between these two groups of countries in relation to the relative number of satisfied consumers; - there is a statistically significant higher proportion of dissatisfied consumers in the new Member States. Compared to the European average, there are two groups of countries with statistically significant higher satisfaction rates (see Table 3.42): - Austria, Denmark, Germany, Cyprus Sweden, Finland (with proportions of satisfied consumers ranging from 80% to 87%) - Luxembourg, Slovenia, Ireland and Hungary (from 71% to 73.5%). In six countries, the satisfaction rates are close to the European average (60%): Belgium, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Greece and Poland. In the remaining countries, satisfaction with water distribution is lower than the EU average: the Netherlands, Malta, Slovakia, Portugal, France, Estonia, Latvia (with satisfaction levels from 50% to 53%) and Spain and Italy where only 40% to 47% of respondents stated to be satisfied with the water distribution. Most of the northern countries are in the first group of countries with high numbers of satisfied consumers, (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Finland), while most Mediterranean ones are in the last group (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Malta). Compared to the other utility services, a rather high number of countries with dissatisfied consumers is observed: Malta (14%), Estonia (12%) and Latvia (12%), as well as Greece, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Portugal, Italy and Lithuania with a proportion of dissatisfied consumers between 8% and 10%. In several countries with average or lower numbers of satisfied consumers, the proportion of dissatisfied consumers was also very low: the figures range from 0.5% in Belgium to 1.5% in Sweden. The Netherlands has both low satisfaction and low dissatisfaction rates, which suggest that their inhabitants are rather neutral regarding this service. SATISFACTION: BEST AMONG THE SERVICES OF GENERAL INTEREST BUT STILL A NORTH-SSOUTH GRADIENT 14 The consumer satisfaction survey was held in all 25 countries that are member of the European Union, and covers 11 \"service sectors of general interest\": electricity supply, gas supply, water distribution, fixed telephony, mobile telephony, urban transport, extra-urban transport, air transport, postal services, retail banking and insurance services. 15 The satisfied respondents are those who rated the service from 8, 9 or 10 on a scale from 1 to 10. The dissatisfied ones rated the service 1, 2, 3 or 4 on a scale from 1 to 10. F igure 3.42 Overall, to what extent are you satisfied with your water supplier?

        "3. Energy and Water 90 (cid:4) Table 3.43 shows that the professional position and the age group affect hardly the satisfaction rate. The only professional category where the number of satisfied consumers is significantly lower than the average is the group of self-employed people (53%). As regards education level, similarly to the two other utility sectors, only the respondents who stopped studying at the age of 15 or before are less satisfied (55%) than the average population. Finally, men are slightly more satisfied than woman with water distribution (61% versus 59%). T able 3.43 Overall, to what extent are you satisfied with your water supplier?

In Austria, Cyprus, Finland and Luxembourg, seven consumers out of ten consider their water provider as having an overall positive image (for an EU-25 average of 49%). The least positive image is found in France and in most of the Mediterranean countries (Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain) where less than four consumers out of ten stated so. The majority of EU-25 consumers (58%) said that their water provider offered a quality service overall. Austrians were the most satisfied consumers as far as the overall quality of water distribution is concerned (83% are \u2018satisfied consumers\u2019) whereas Italians are again at the other side of the spectrum (38% are \u2018satisfied consumers\u2019). With regard to consumers\u2019 attitudes to price, there are considerable differences across the EU. In six countries, less than 30% of consumers think that their water provider prices are fair in comparison with the service provided (for an EU-25 average of 38%). This is the case in Slovakia (22%), Malta (23%), Italy and France (26% each), Portugal and Spain (29% each). On the other hand, Finland, Austria, Slovenia, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Hungary and Ireland show proportions greater than 50%. In the three countries where the market for water distribution is liberalised, i.e. Finland, France and Latvia, nine consumers out of ten said they will still use their current supplier in the next twelve months. Overall, a fair share of EU-25 consumers (72%) thinks that their water provider services are available for everybody. In the New Member States this proportion reached 82% (against 70% in the EU-15). In Finland, on the other hand, only 44% of respondents agreed with the statement. Although water distribution is liberalised in Finland, France and Latvia, few consumers in these countries believe that there is enough competition (13% on average and only 4% in Latvia). Moreover, even fewer consumers find it easy to change from one supplier to another (8% on average). The possibility of buying water distribution services in another country convinces a small share of EU consumers (14%), even though in Spain it does for a quarter of users.

        "4. Information Society 94 (cid:4) Until the mid 1990s, all telecommunications services in Europe were provided by state-owned operators in a monopoly situation, with the exception of the UK market, which was in a duopoly situation. However, following the launch of the European telecommunications policy under the impulsion of the Commission in 1987, the process of liberalization of the sector has been progressively rolled out and by January 1998 all telecommunication services have been fully open to competition in the majority of EU countries. In all EU countries, the liberalisation and the implementation of the new EU regulation led to important price decreases, especially for international and long distance telephony, to more choice and better quality services. In parallel, the last decade witnessed an outright boom in the number of mobile telephone subscriptions (at EU-25 level, the number of subscriptions per 100 inhabitants passed from 8 in 1996 to 90 in 2004) and increased competition has generally caused the price of access to mobile telephony to gradually drop. One of the most-documented events in the explosion of communications and information technology is the rapid pace of growth that has been witnessed with respect to the Internet. By the turn of the century only 5% of Europeans still did not know what the Internet was 1 .

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 95 When analysing Eurostat data on network dimensions, it is important to bear in mind that it may be difficult to distinguish between private and business use of the telephone. However, as an official figure, Eurostat's Telecommunications database reports that approximately 70% of main telephone lines were residential, as opposed to professional, ranging between 45% in Lithuania (2004) and 88% in Italy (1999). Total number of fixed lines peaked in 2001 The number of fixed telephone lines in the EU has increased by 10% over the past eight years. In 1996, there were 204.9 million lines. This increased to reach a peak of 227.4 million in 2001 and declining slightly to 276.3 million in 2004 (see Figure 4.1). Whilst the EU average stood at 50 lines per 100 inhabitants, Germany and Denmark displayed the highest connectivity rates in 2004, with 66 and 65 lines per 100 inhabitants respectively, (see Table 4.2). These were followed by Cyprus (64 lines/100 inhab.) and Sweden (63 lines/100 inhab.). In the case of Sweden, it is interesting to note that network expansion has been slower than population growth during the 1990s. Consequently, Sweden's connectivity rate has decreased from 68 lines per 100 inhabitants in 1996, a sign that an upper limit has been reached (with Sweden's connectivity rate the highest within the EU until 1997) and that a substitution effect towards mobile subscribers has begun. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) losing momentum The digitisation of the fixed line infrastructure is virtually complete across the EU. On the customer side (businesses and households), the number of ISDN lines has witnessed rapid growth. From virtually no ISDN subscriptions in 1990, their number soared to peak in 2001, with some 28 million subscriptions 2 ,. Household use of ISDN is slowly losing momentum, in particular as a means for high-speed Internet access, where it competes with digital subscriber lines (DSL) and cable modems. According to a 2006 Eurobarometer survey (64.4) on E- Communications used by households, ISDN 3 is still an important means of telephone access in Luxembourg, Germany, the United Kingdom 4 , the Netherlands and 4.1 FIXED TELEPHONY ACCESS AND USAGE 2 Eurostat's Telecommunications database: BE, EL, FR, IT, LV, MT, AT and UK, not available. 3 According to the national circumstances, ISDN can be used either as a second fixed line for voice call or as a separate fixed line for Internet access. 4 Attention is drawn to the fact that 24% seems too high in comparison with the results of other surveys on the matter. 19 96 19 97 19 98 19 99 20 00 20 01 20 02 20 03 20 04 EU-25 46 47 49 49 50 50 50 50 50 EU-15 51 52 53 53 54 54 53 53 53 BE : 49 50 43 38 36 36 34 33 CZ 27 32 36 37 38 38 36 36 34 DK 62 63 66 68 71 72 69 67 65 DE 54 55 57 59 61 64 65 66 66 EE 31 33 36 37 38 37 35 34 33 EL 50 51 51 52 52 51 49 47 51 ES 39 40 41 42 44 43 43 43 45 FR 57 58 58 58 58 58 58 57 57 IE 38 41 43 47 42 49 45 41 40 IT 44 45 46 47 48 48 48 46 45 CY 56 58 60 62 64 62 61 59 64 LV 30 30 31 30 31 31 30 28 27 LT 28 29 31 32 34 33 27 24 24 LU 63 67 69 73 76 77 56 55 54 HU 26 30 33 35 37 37 36 36 35 MT 49 50 51 52 54 53 53 52 52 NL 54 57 60 61 62 51 50 48 48 AT 48 50 50 48 48 41 40 39 38 PL 17 20 23 26 28 30 31 32 33 PT 38 40 41 42 42 44 40 43 43 SI 33 36 36 38 40 40 41 41 43 SK 23 26 29 31 31 29 26 24 23 FI 55 56 55 55 55 54 52 49 46 SE 68 68 68 67 65 67 65 65 63 UK 52 54 55 53 53 53 52 52 : BG 32 32 33 34 35 37 37 36 36 HR : : : : 38 40 38 38 38 RO 14 15 16 17 17 19 19 20 23 TR : 25 26 27 27 27 27 27 27 Slovenia. In these countries, more than two in ten households use this kind of service. More than one in three households is equipped with an ISDN-line in Luxembourg. Even if, on average, ISDN services are used by 15% of EU- 25 households, the technology is far less widely implemented in countries such as Hungary, Latvia, Turkey or Bulgaria where not even one in 20 households is equipped with a line. In Romania a share of households equivalent to the EU-25 average are equipped with the ISDN technology.

        "4. Information Society 96 (cid:4) Penetration rates of fixed telephony persistently uneven According to a Eurobarometer survey (64.4) conducted end 2005/beginning of 2006, almost all households in Sweden, Malta the Netherlands and Luxembourg have a fixed line 5 at home. On the other hand, this is the case in less than one in two households in Lithuania. Penetration rates of fixed telephony are also low in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Portugal. As far as Accession and Candidate countries are concerned, nine in ten Croatian households have a fixed line at home. The other non- Member States are found below the European average. (see Figure 4.3). Based on available data for the EU-25 in 2006 (Eurobarometer 65.3), 76% of EU citizens considered fixed telephone services to be important (see Figure 4.4). Higher than average figures were seen among Germans and Maltese (both 91%), as well as Swedes (90%) and Greeks (88%). 23% of the EU citizens, however, considered that fixed telephone services were not important in their daily lives and figures well above the EU-25 average were noted in Finland (62%), Lithuania (59%) and in the Czech Republic (58%). This view is even more polarised in certain countries with high figures of 36%, 34% and 32% noted in the Czech Republic, Finland and Lithuania for those saying fixed telephone services were not at all important in their lives. These figures should be compared with the EU-25 average of just 9%.

Finland: fixed lines considered less important due to high usage of mobile telephony Analysis, on a country-by-country basis, of that segment of the survey which referred to those who thought that fixed telephone lines were 'not at all important', offers some interesting results. It appears that six of the seven countries which have averages which are more than double that of the EU-25, i.e. 19%, are new Member States (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovakia), with the seventh being an old Member State - Finland. The presence of Finland in this list may well be as a result of the wide usage and importance of mobile telephony in that country. The high shares in the new Member States could be due to mobile telephony networks having developed more rapidly than the fixed telephone network and offering a cheaper means of access to the public telephone network through the acquisition of pre-paid cards and subsidised terminals. Moreover, citizens facing a considerable waiting period to get connected to the fixed telephone network tend to turn to faster solutions, which mobile telephony is indeed. As might be anticipated, considering the socio- demographic spread of usage of mobile phones, fixed telephone services were deemed important in the daily lives of 85% of 55 year olds compared with just 64% of the youngest group who are keener on the mobile alternative. While 79% of women as opposed to 72% of men held this view, there was little variation by education level. Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:45 Page 96 ",

        "4. Information Society 98 (cid:4) As might be expected, international calls, including both intra and extra-EU calls, were much shorter than national calls, averaging just 55 seconds per line per day in 2004 6 (see Table 4.6), or 6 minutes and 24 seconds per week. Smaller countries naturally reported longer average duration for international calls, with the highest figures in Luxembourg (251 seconds per day, influenced by a high proportion of cross-border workers), Cyprus (152 seconds per day) and Ireland (118 seconds per day). Amongst the larger Member States, particularly low levels of international calls were recorded in Poland (11 seconds per day in 2004), Hungary (15 seconds per day in 2004) and Portugal (19 seconds per day in 2004). It must be noted that the above figures do not differentiate between calls made by households and those made by business, which represent a particularly large share of international traffic.

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 99 Telecommunications consumption expenditure can be broken down between equipment and services (see Figures 4.7 and 4.8). As a general rule, equipment represents a marginal share of total expenditure and is limited to the occasional acquisition of home phones, answering machines, mobile phones or fax machines. In 1999, on average, consumption expenditure on telecommunications equipment was below 40 PPS per household per year. The very high value displayed by Luxembourg (199 PPS) can probably be attributed to exceptional local circumstances (and notably the high number of cross-border workers that buy telecommunication equipment in Luxembourg). Greeks and Portuguese spend most on services Household consumption expenditure on telecommunication services ranged between 315 PPS (Spain) and 751 PPS (Greece) in 1999 (data on Ireland not being available). In relative terms, consumers in Greece and Portugal dedicated the highest share of their household budget to telecommunication services (3.3%), in contrast with Spain (2.0%), whilst for most other countries the average stood around 2.4%. The weight of telecommunication services in total consumption expenditure was higher in households from lower income and age brackets. Similarly, it was notably higher for single revenue households, such as persons living alone or single parents with dependent children. It should however be noted that these data refer to the Household Budget Survey of 1999 (these surveys are carried out only every five to six years and the latest results are not yet available). As major developments in telecommunications have taken place in recent years, these data should be looked at with care.

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 101 Telephone charges: the concept of baskets Tables 4.11 to 4.14 present the results of a European Commission report on telephone charges of residential users which analyses the price developments over the 2000-2005 period. The study uses the OECD basket results (see following paragraph) in order to maintain consistency over the 6 years. The report shows the prices as of August each year from 2000 to 2004 and as of 1 September 2005. Tariff data were collected from primary sources, i.e. directly from the telecommunication enterprises, their websites and pricelists. Data were validated by the NRAs so as to reinforce the reliability of the information. Information includes also price data for the main competing operator in each country. The selection of the operator was done on the basis of market presence and size. During the period observed, there have been a few changes in operators' names. In May 2000 the revised OECD baskets were adopted. These baskets are built along the same lines as the former. In fact there are only minor differences; the changes reflect the current usage patterns better. The baskets now include calls to mobile telephones and international calls. Table 4.11 shows the results from the OECD Composite basket, including both national fixed and mobile calls (respectively 1 200 and 120 calls per year), and international calls (72 calls per year). Figures shown refer to the incumbent operator in each country. Standard tariffs are used, excluding any discount packages.

The basket includes both national and international calls: it includes 1 200 national calls, 72 international calls and 120 calls to mobile per year. (2 ) The average is a weighted average across the 25 EU Member States, using population as weight. (3 ) For USA and Japan there are different operators for national and international calls, as there is a split market where different operators traditionally have been allowed into the two markets segments: for USA Verizon, NY and Pacbell, CA are used together with AT&T, while for Japan NTT and KDDI are used.

        "4. Information Society 102 (cid:4) Continuous drop in prices In 2005, the charges for the basket as mentioned above amounted to 41.43 PPP at EU-25 level (see Table 4.11), substantially lower than only a year earlier (44.68 PPP). However, when looking at the price development for the individual Member States, highly individual patterns emerge. In this year, the basket price charged by the main operators in Denmark, Germany, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden and the UK remained clearly under the EU average. Conversely, those in Lithuania, the Czech republic, Slovakia and especially Latvia and Poland were quite high. Prices paid in 2005 for these baskets in Japan and the US remained under the aggregate EU price level. An analysis of the detailed data behind the residential basket prices shown in Table 4.11 reveals that the average fixed (subscription) / usage (price of calls) relationship for 2005 is 41% fixed and 59% usage. This changed from 39% fixed and 61% usage in 2004. Five of the 10 new Member States have a fixed portion well below the average (<30%), while all of the EU-15 countries are reasonably close to the average, most of them with above average fixed proportions. Table 4.12 shows the development of the call charges actually paid by the consumer on individual national calls. For those countries where unit based charging is used, the cost of the amount of full units was calculated (there is a move towards per second charging in most European countries and in 2005 only Germany, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta did not use per second charging). Any call set- up charges, minimum charges and/or call specific duration allowances have been taken into account, on the basis of a ten-minute call at a distance of 50 km. Large price span among the incumbents At EU-25 level, the price for such a call amounted to 0.86 PPP in 2005, 36% less than 5 years earlier. Looking at the individual Member States, the price differences were substantial: in 2005, the price for a national 10 minute call charged by the incumbent ranged between 0.23 PPP (Cyprus) to 2.32 PPP (Slovakia). Observing the prices charged by competitors, savings can be substantial. Large price differences were notably observed in France, Ireland, Italy and Slovakia, whereas they were only marginal in Belgium, Denmark, Spain Luxembourg and Austria. Furthermore, Table 4.12 reveals that the incumbent operator is normally more expensive than the competition, although this is not always the case.

        "4. Information Society 104 (cid:4) Table 4.13 presents the development of the call charges actually paid by the consumer on individual international calls. As the issue of unit based charges is less relevant for international calls, due to very short units, data have been based on average per minute call charges. Call charges have been calculated for 10 minute calls, but the duration doesn't alter much in terms of price relationships between originating countries and destinations. Call setup charges are included, as are the scheme with different prices for first and additional periods used in some countries. Prices of individual international calls are analysed with near EU destination country, as defined in the table below: T L V L Y C T I E I R F S E L E E E E D K D Z C E B m o r F U E r a e n o T E S E S L E L E K U E B T P T I I F R F E S E D R F L N T M U H U L m o r F A S T P L P T K K U E S I F I S U E r a e n o T R F K D E S T A Z C S E E D E D E D T I T A E D Latvia by far the most expensive in 'international' On average (EU-25), the price of an international ten- minute call has dropped by nearly 31% between 2000 and 2005 (from 3.56 PPP to 2.47 PPP). But as for national calls, prices expressed in Purchase Power Parities vary considerably among the Member States. The price range charged by the respective incumbent operators in 2005 went from 0.49 PPP in Sweden to 13.34 PPP in Latvia. Prices for international calls were also expensive in Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia. Choosing a competitor can save a lot of money in certain countries. However, in Member States where there is a mature competitive market, price differences are generally less strong. A careful look at US and Japanese prices suggest that international telephone calls are relatively cheap for US citizens but expensive for the Japanese. Table 4.14 shows the monthly rental (including VAT) for a single PSTN connection for residential customers. For the United Kingdom there has been a change of residential package in 2004, after BT abandoned the Residential Standard tariff. Now the BT Together Option 1 tariff is used. USA data is for the New York Metro area. Message rate service is assumed, i.e. where local calls are charged on an individual basis. In Finland and Japan the monthly rental will depend on where in the country the line is connected. The charges shown are for the capital/most densely populated area. This table doesn't show the corresponding monthly rental charges for competitor providers in each country. However, most of these operators use indirect access, and will as such not have any monthly charges related to line rental. Usage costs down, fixed costs up Table 4.14 outlines that in contrast to the prices for national or international calls, which dropped significantly during the period observed, the rental charges for a fixed residential telephone line actually increased at EU-25 level (gradual increase from 12.13 PPP in 2000 to 15.82 PPP in 2005). Monthly rental charges also went up in the US (on the basis of data from Verizon) whereas they remained stable in Japan. In the individual EU Member States, rental charges increased particularly fast in the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. At the other end of the scale, three countries registered price decreases: Denmark (but only slight), Austria and Finland. In Latvia, charges remained constant throughout the 2000- 2005 period. Still expressed in Purchase Power Parities (PPP), the monthly rental charge for a fixed residential telephone line in 2005 was lowest in Malta (8.90 PPP), quite far off the average price paid at EU-25 level (15.82 PPP). It was by far the highest in Hungary, with 23.91 PPP. Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:45 Page 104 ",

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 107 Large difference in the perception of the cost of telephone services When looking at the results of the Eurobarometer survey (65.3) focusing on consumers' opinions of Services of General Interest services, there appears to be a substantial difference in attitudes in price for fixed telephone services. 93% of Slovaks and 90% of Lithuanians considered the prices affordable and, across the European Union, this was a view held by 76% of the poll (see Table 4.15). On the other hand, a relatively high percentage of Finns (33%), Poles (31%) and Cypriots (29%) said the services they were using were not affordable. This view is, in fact, taken further by the Poles of whom a quarter (24%) said spontaneously that prices were excessive. This compares with an EU-25 average of just 10%. It is important to bear in mind that the affordability remains a personal judgment which may vary from one individual to another. There were just marginal variations on a socio- demographic basis by age, gender, education and occupation. In contrast to the findings of the 2004 Eurobarometer survey, and considering the general drop in telephone communication prices outlined on the previous pages, the numbers of respondents considering the price of mobile and fixed lines as not affordable has almost been halved to 13% (2006) from 22% (2004), while the proportion of those considering the prices to be excessive has gone up by only two points from 11% over this two-year period.

        "4. Information Society 108 (cid:4) With the progressive liberalisation of telecommunications, consumer choice has expanded at a rapid pace over the past decade. A number of new communications providers (as opposed to incumbent, national providers) have entered the EU market and started to compete on price and service, attracting many households with respect to the telephony market (see Table 4.16). Table 4.17 displays the average satisfaction of Europeans consumers with fixed telephony, according to a consumer satisfaction survey on services of general interest 7 undertaken in 2006. Overall, consumer satisfaction assesses the fixed telephone service relatively low in comparison with the other services of general interest. The average satisfaction is slightly higher in the EU-15 than in the new Member States. In fact the differences between the new Member States and EU-15 do not stem from differences between the proportion of satisfied persons - which are not significant - but rather from the higher proportion of consumers who are dissatisfied. At EU-25 level, 8.4% of the surveyed persons declared to be dissatisfied. The new Member States score substantially higher (12.6%) than EU-15 (7.6%). Most dissatisfied consumers were found in the Czech Republic (23%) and Portugal (20%), but relatively high proportions were also registered for Italy (close to 15%), Poland (13%) and Hungary (just over 10%). All other countries showed dissatisfaction rates of well under 10%.

(% of respondents) ( 1 ) The older, the more satisfied Table 4.18 shows the proportion of satisfied and dissatisfied consumers distributed by socio-economic category. The retired people are relatively more satisfied (58.3%), as well as the white collar workers (55.4%). Both groups are significantly more satisfied than the EU-25 average. Next come unemployed people (54.9%), blue collar workers (52.5%), managers (50.6%) and house- persons (49.9%), with satisfaction rates close to the EU-25 average. Finally, substantially lower, students (41.4%) and self-employed people (40.5%) are significantly less satisfied than the average. These two groups also include the highest proportion of dissatisfied consumers (over 10%). Whereas fixed telephone operators enjoy a positive image in most of the European countries with results above 50%, 6 countries stand aside: Portugal (25%), Italy (31%), Spain (35%), Denmark, Netherlands and Sweden (39% each). More than 70% of users in Slovenia, Lithuania, Ireland, Cyprus, Latvia, Belgium, Estonia, Germany and Hungary think that their fixed telephone provider offers a quality service overall whereas this is the case of only 33% of Italians and Portuguese and 47% of Dutch citizens. Germany and Ireland are the countries where fixed telephone users are the most satisfied with the overall prices charged by their operator (61% of \u2018satisfied\u2019 in both countries). At the other side of the spectrum, the lowest shares (less than 40%) of consumers satisfied with the price are found in most of the Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece and Malta), Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, France and Slovakia. (1 ) In each country, the target population was composed of people aged at least 18 years old and having used the service during the past 12 months; respondents have been asked to evaluate their overall satisfaction of the service by using a 10-point scale: the satisfied respondents are those who rated the service from 8, 9 or 10 on a scale from 1 to 10 and the dissatisfied ones rated the service 1, 2, 3 or 4 on a scale from 1 to 10.

        "4. Information Society 110 (cid:4) Commitment to the phone operator high, except for the Czechs and Estonians The level of commitment towards fixed telephone operators is rather high in the European Union. Indeed, 77% of consumers said they will still use their fixed telephone supplier in the next 12 months. In Luxembourg and Greece, this is the case of more than nine users out of ten. People in Czech Republic and in Estonia, on the other hand, show the lowest level of commitment (61%). This variable was not measured in Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia as the fixed telephone service is not liberalised in these countries. Most of the EU-25 consumers (84%), especially in the EU-15 (85% against 79% in the new Member States), think that fixed telephone services are available for everybody in their country. In Greece, Ireland, Portugal and the Netherlands this is true for more than 90% of users. The lowest proportion of people agreeing with this statement is found in Latvia (64%). As regards competition, 75% of EU-25 users (77% in EU-15 and 64% in the 10 new Member States) believe that it is possible to get what one wants from any fixed telephone supplier without having to be afraid to get less quality. Irish and Dutch people as well as Germans agree with this statement most (more than 80% in each country) whereas people in Latvia, Malta, Lithuania and Czech Republic are only 32%, 35%, 43% and 46% respectively to do so. However a lower proportion of EU-25 users think (67% of EU-25 against 69% in EU-15 and 57% in the new Member States) it would be easy to change from one operator to another. The lowest proportions of people agreeing with this statement are found in Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Czech Republic (30%, 35%, 37% and 48% respectively). According to the 2006 Eurobarometer survey (65.3) on consumers' opinions of services of general interest, EU-25 citizens found it generally easy to compare offers from fixed line telephone providers and 53% of the surveyed said this task was easy. However, more than a third (34%) took the contrary view and this important segment is shown by country breakdown (see Table 4.19). In this respect, a look to the number of network operators could be useful (see Table 4.16). Comparing offers gets difficult when there are many competitors Taking a positive stance once again, Greeks headed this ranking with 74% of them saying this comparison was easy and this figure includes the highest 'very easy' response from 43% of the Hellenic survey. On the other hand, 53% of Swedes said that this process was difficult and a figure of 46% was noted in Belgium. Very high 'don't know' figures involving around a third of each country's survey were observed in Estonia (32%), Finland (33%), in Lithuania (34%), Cyprus (35%) and Latvia (37%). The Finnish figure may well be caused by the leaning towards mobile telephony in that country. It is worth noting that there are high \u2018don't know\u2019 figures for the Baltic States. While just 44% of those aged 55 or more found it easy to compare offers from different fixed telephone providers, this figure rises to 60% amongst those aged 15 to 24 (see Table 4.20). There were no significant variations by occupation or education. T able 4.19 In general, how easy do you find it to compare offers from different fixed telephone providers?

Of this group, two-thirds (16%) found the switching process easy and this figure rises to 33% of Swedes and 24% of the Dutch. It is important that citizens who wish to change providers of any service should be allowed to do this without hindrance. Thus, attention should be paid to an average of 4% of Union citizens who switched fixed telephone providers but found the process difficult, notably in Sweden (7%) and Italy (8%). A worse situation from a consumer point of view is, however, noted amongst those who tried to switch but gave up due to the obstacles they faced. This was the situation faced by 8% of the Polish and 9% of the Dutch. On the whole, however, most EU citizens (65%) had no interest in switching service provider in the area of fixed line telephony. Particularly satisfied fixed line users are to be found in Slovenia (89%) and Cyprus (91%).

However, in Italy and Poland, figures are substantially less - at 36% and 33% respectively. There were 9% of the total survey who were not aware of the terms and conditions of their contracts and, in Portugal and Estonia, this rises to 19% and 20% respectively. Eleven percent of EU 25 citizens had made a complaint about the services provided by their fixed telephone operator over the past two years and particularly high figures were noted in Sweden (19%) and Italy (20%) (see Table 4.23). Citizens chose to complain to the service provider rather than to a complaint handling body and the 11% of complainants were split - 10% to the first alternative and just 1% to a complaint handling body. While there were no significant variations by gender or age, amongst those who had made a complaint on fixed telephone services, 15% of the most educated had done this compared with 9% of those whose education had ended at age 15 or less (see Table 4.24). Not surprisingly, having a certain level of education seems to be a contributory factor in voicing complaints. The self-employed were relatively outspoken in this area and 19% of their number had made a complaint over the past two years compared with 12% of white-collar and manual workers and just 8% of house persons and the retired.

        "4. Information Society 114 (cid:4) There has been a widespread adoption of cellular wireless technology in recent years. The number of mobile subscribers reached 409.2 million in the EU in 2004, equivalent to 90% of the population, up from 3.1 million in 1990. Now, in all countries the penetration of mobile phones exceeds that of fixed lines. In fact, the penetration of mobile phones is approximately 1.8 times higher on average than that of fixed lines in the EU, this ratio having almost doubled in Lithuania and in Slovakia (see table 4.26). 4.2 MOBILE TELEPHONY ACCESS AND USAGE 19 96 19 97 19 98 19 99 20 00 20 01 20 02 20 03 20 04 EU-25 8 12 21 35 56 68 75 81 90 EU-15 9 14 24 40 63 74 79 85 93 BE 5 10 17 31 51 68 79 83 88 CZ 2 5 9 19 42 68 84 95 106 DK 25 27 36 49 63 74 83 89 95 DE 7 10 17 29 59 68 72 79 86 EE 5 10 18 28 41 54 65 77 93 EL 5 9 19 36 54 73 85 81 84 ES 8 10 16 38 61 73 82 90 92 FR 4 10 19 35 51 63 65 70 74 IE 8 15 26 38 63 73 77 86 94 IT 11 21 36 52 74 90 93 98 108 CY 11 14 17 22 32 45 59 77 90 LV 1 3 7 12 17 26 39 52 66 LT 1 4 8 10 14 29 47 61 89 LU 11 16 50 49 70 93 107 120 143 HU 5 7 10 16 30 49 68 78 86 MT 4 5 5 6 29 57 70 73 77 NL 7 11 22 43 68 76 76 83 91 AT 7 15 29 53 76 82 84 88 98 PL 1 2 5 10 17 25 36 46 61 PT 7 15 30 46 65 81 83 90 93 SI 2 5 10 33 57 76 77 87 94 SK 1 4 9 12 21 41 54 68 80 FI 29 41 55 63 72 81 87 91 96 SE 28 36 44 58 72 81 89 98 109 UK 12 15 25 40 67 75 84 89 102 BG 1 0 2 4 9 20 32 45 62 HR : : : 8 24 39 53 57 64 RO : 1 2 5 9 20 23 32 47 TR : 3 5 11 22 26 33 40 49 T able 4.26 Mobile telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants (units) Source : Eurostat, Telecommunication Services (theme4/telecom) Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:46 Page 114 ",

In the meantime however, it has been overtaken by a number of countries. Luxembourg boasted the highest penetration rate of mobile phones in 2004, with 143 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. The penetration rate can reach more than 100 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants since one person can have more than one subscription. The Luxembourg figure is influenced by the high number of cross-border workers that frequently have a Luxembourg subscription alongside their French, Belgian or German subscriptions. As in the case of fixed lines, it should indeed be borne in mind that once again these figures include phones acquired for professional purposes, which may account for a significant share of mobile subscriptions. The number of subscriptions per 100 inhabitants has surpassed the 100 milestone in four other Member States: Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom have all gone above this threshold. Many other Member States are close to the landmark and the rest of them are steadily approaching. The saturation of the market at this point, as many had expected, does not seem to be happening. 'Pre-paid': very high in Portugal and Italy An important development within the sphere of mobile telephony in recent years has been the introduction of prepaid access. Pre-paid cards constitute a convenient solution for persons claiming \u2018not to need\u2019 a mobile phone or deeming it \u2018too expensive\u2019. Pre-paid cards grant subscribers the basic benefits of mobile network access (being reachable or being able to make emergency calls), whilst giving them greater control over expenditure without feeling burdened by a subscription. According to the OECD 8 , \u2018with the exception of Finland, the [mobile penetration] rankings of different countries have been increasingly affected by how actively operators have marketed pre-paid cards. In countries such as Italy and Portugal, the overwhelming majority of users are pre-paid\u2019, with levels between 79% and 91% (see table 4.27). In contrast, the post-paid model still represents the vast majority of subscriptions in Finland. 8 Communications Outlook, OECD, 2001. Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:46 Page 115 ",

This means that the mobile telephony penetration rate is slightly higher than that for fixed telephony (including ISDN) at 78%. Nordic countries and Netherlands top the ranking (see Figure 4.28). However, it should be noted that six new Member States have mobile penetration rates above the EU average: Slovenia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Malta, Estonia and Latvia.

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 117 The younger, the more important One of the most significant figures to come out of the survey relating to mobile phones is the importance this service has for younger people. Nine out of ten 15-24 year olds said a mobile phone was important in their daily lives. In fact, 59% of this age-group deemed it to be \u2018very important\u2019 (see Table 4.30). At the other end of the age spectrum, just 46% of people aged 55 or more believed a mobile phone was an important part of their daily lives and of this number just 20% said it was very important. It is interesting to note relatively high figures amongst the unemployed where 75% said a mobile phone was important and just 25% took the contrary view. Education was also a major factor in this with only 52% of the least educated compared with 74% of the most educated giving the mobile phone this level of importance. Larger households rated the mobile phone more important than smaller units with figures rising from 56% amongst single person households to 79% where there were 4 or more people living under the same roof. Nearly three- quarters of the males surveyed (73%) believed a mobile phone was an important part of their daily life compared with just 65% of women.

Well illustrated by the case of Luxembourg, where many (non-resident) cross-border workers also have a Luxembourg subscription, it should be noted that as the number of personal subscriptions increases, the average use tends to decrease. Furthermore, persons might be having (or given by their employer) an additional mobile phone for professional use only, which also influences the average duration of calls. 2.1 1.6 1.72.1 2.1 2.1 2.4 2.6 2.6 2.8 2.8 3.0 3.1 3.3 3.43.84.2 6.0 5.3 2.7 1.6 1.8 1.2 1.3 2.2 2.2 2.2 0 2 4 6 8 TR RO HR PL LU DE CZ EL( ) SE LT IT( ) SK LV( ) HU EE DK NL( ) MT( ) UK( ) ES AT( ) SI IE PT FR( ) FI CY 2 2 3 2 2 4 3 2 F igure 4.31 Average duration of cellular mobile calls, 2004 (minutes per subscriber per day) ( 1 ) Source : Eurostat, Telecommunication Services (theme4/telecom) 9 Excluding BE.

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 119 The analysis of national (as opposed to roaming) mobile services is based on the OECD baskets for digital mobile services. Due to significant changes in usage patterns the OECD baskets have been redefined with effect from August 2002. The new baskets are not compatible with the \u2018old\u2019 ones, in the sense that they contain an SMS element, include calls to several mobile networks, and do not cover international calls. Thus, Table 4.32 analyses the new, revised basket based on a medium usage level. All packages analysed in this table are Post-Paid packages (i.e. covering only about half of the market, as the remainder is pre-paid packages - see Table 4.27). Some of the main properties of the new OECD medium usage basket are: - 75 outgoing calls per month + 35 SMS messages; - 36% of calls are to fixed line phones, 64% to mobile phones. The basket also has a unique definition of time of day distribution and call durations, and includes the monthly rental, and any registration charges distributed over 3 years. The two most prominent operators in each country are covered, based on available subscriber numbers. All relevant packages from each operator are considered, but the final results presented here only show the cheapest package for each basket. Results are shown as Fixed (registration and monthly rental) and Usage (cost of calls and messages). Included minutes, messages and/or values are covered in the analysis 10 . The asterisk (*) behind the package name means that the package name and most probably its structure has changed between the updates. The package chosen at any time is the cheapest package from that provider for the usage profile in question. This may give rise to significant price changes over time. The balance of fixed and usage in the mobile baskets will vary considerably between countries, as the preferred packages in some countries contain a lot of calling time included in the fixed charge, hence a higher fixed charge. 'low fixed-high usage' or 'high fixed-low usage' cost structure Taking into account the above elements, it appears that the price of this medium usage basket amounted to an average 40.35 PPP at EU level (simple average) in 2005. 41% of this amount went to the account of fixed cost (line rental). Far off the average total cost of the basket at EU level were countries such as Denmark, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden in which the operators charged notably less (expressed in PPP), and conversely the Czech Republic, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia, where the basket price was substantially higher. Prices charged by operators vary considerably. As suggested earlier, often a 'low fixed-high usage' or 'high fixed-low usage' pattern can be detected. PRICES AND AFFORDABILITY 10 It has been established that the calculation of included values or allowances produce misleading results in some cases, when the included value or allowance does not cover all types of calls. This is expected to be corrected in the 2006 revision of the OECD baskets. Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:46 Page 119 ",

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 121 Usage of mobile telephony despite financial considerations Considering the results of Eurobarometer survey 65.3 led in 2006 on consumers' opinions of services of general interest, three-quarters of the people actually using mobile telephones said that they considered them to be affordable and numbers of 90% or above were noted in the Czech Republic (90%), Austria (91%), Lithuania (93%), with a high figure of 94% being seen in Slovakia (see Table 4.33). There might be an implied degree of need driving economic decisions amongst the surveyed persons in France: compared with an EU-25 average of 13%, nearly a third (31%) of French mobile telephone users said that they considered the services to be not affordable. This scenario of need outweighing purely financial considerations is also seen in the data of mobile telephone users in Malta where more than one-fifth (22%) of those polled spontaneously said that mobile telephone charges were excessive. Other high figures were observed in Italy (16%) and Poland (15%) compared with an EU-25 average of just 10%. There were minimal variations by gender, age and education when users of mobile phones were asked whether they were able to afford the services they were using. However, as might be expected, managers (82%) and other white-collar workers (80%) had fewer problems in this area than manual workers and the retired (75%) and the unemployed (72% - see Table 4.34).

        "4. Information Society 122 (cid:4) Table 4.35 displays the average satisfaction of Europeans consumers with mobile telephony as assessed in the consumer satisfaction survey on services of general interest 11 undertaken by the European Commission in 2006. Amongst the 11 sectors surveyed in this study, mobile phone service is the third most appreciated service. The average score is 7.9 on a scale from 1 to 10. There is a significant difference between EU-15 and the new Member States: in the latter group the average satisfaction is higher. This difference is due to the much higher proportion of satisfied consumers in the new Member States; in fact the proportion of dissatisfied consumers is not different between both groups of countries. An interesting observation is that most countries have proportions of satisfied consumers that are higher than the EU-25 average. Satisfaction reaches very high levels in Cyprus, Germany and Hungary (wit a satisfaction level of about 83%). Much lower proportions of satisfied consumers are found in France (55%), the Netherlands and Italy (about 50%) and finally Spain (42%). The dissatisfaction rate varies between Spain (9%) and Cyprus (0.7%) but not in the same order. The two outstanding exceptions are the Czech Republic (6%) and Denmark (6%), which are in the top four regarding the dissatisfaction level, while their satisfaction levels are beyond the EU-25 average.

Table 4.36 shows the proportion of satisfied and dissatisfied consumers distributed by socio-economic category. There are no strong differences between the satisfaction levels of the different occupational categories. Self-employed people are the least satisfied, significantly under the EU average with 60%. Other categories are statistically equal to the EU average. Regarding the education level, the distinction that was noted in other sectors also persists here: consumers who did not complete secondary education (significantly under the EU-25 average with a satisfied proportion of 62%), and the other categories (statistically equal to the EU average).

        "4. Information Society 124 (cid:4) Operators in the new Member States enjoy a more positive image than in the EU-15. Indeed, for 80% their mobile provider has an overall good reputation in the market (against 66% in the EU-15). Amongst the new Member States, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia are the countries where the highest proportion of users agreeing with this statement is observed (88% for the first, 80% for the last 3). In the EU- 15, Germany ranks first (82%). Spain and Netherlands are the only countries in the EU-25 where less than 50% of people acknowledge the good reputation of their mobile phone operator (44% and 48% respectively). Speaking of quality, users in the new Member States are also more satisfied of the services provided by their operator than in the EU-15 (80% for the first against 69% for the latter). The results by country are similar to what has been observed for the overall image. Dutch people are more satisfied with their supplier's quality of service (56%) than with its overall image in the market (48%). Italy and Spain are the only two countries where the lowest proportion of people satisfied with the overall quality of their mobile phone provider are found (47% and 43% respectively). Most EU citizens happy with their mobile operator Mobile phone users are relatively satisfied with their operator's prices (55% in the EU-25). This is especially the case in the new Member States (65% against 53% in the EU-15). At the individual country level, in countries such as Ireland, Cyprus, Poland, Denmark, Austria, Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany, the share of people who are satisfied with their operator's prices ranges from 60% to 77%. In 6 countries, this share falls down below 50%: Spain (26%), Italy (39%), the Netherlands (42%), France and Portugal (44% each) as well as Sweden (46%). The level of commitment towards mobile telephone operators is rather high in the European Union. Indeed, 84% of consumers said they will still use their mobile telephone supplier in the next 12 months. In the new Member States there are 88% who say so. In Portugal, Greece, Latvia, Czech Republic and Hungary the level of commitment exceeds 90%. In Denmark, 76% said they will keep their provider but 15% will not, which is the highest score compared to the European average (7%). In Cyprus, almost a quarter could not make up their mind (24% of \u2018don't know\u2019 against a European average of 9%). Most of the EU-25 consumers (88%) think that mobile telephone services are available for everybody in their country. In Greece and Ireland this is true for 98% and 96% of the users respectively. The lowest proportion of people agreeing with this statement is found in Cyprus (60%). Speaking of competition, 89% of EU-25 users (90% in EU- 15 and 86% in the new Member States) believe that it is possible to get what one wants from any mobile telephone supplier without having to be afraid to get less quality. Greeks (98%), Estonians (97%), Latvians and Britons (95% each), Dutch (94%), Germans and Portuguese (93%), Spaniards (91%) and Polish (90%) agree with this statement most whereas in Malta only 52% do so. A lower proportion of EU-25 users (78% of EU25 against 77% in EU-15 and 82% in the new Member States) think that it would be easy to change from one operator to another. In France and Denmark it appears to be more difficult than in other countries as only 54% and 60% respectively said there are no barriers. Comparing different operators' offers difficult in more developed markets Only 50% of EU citizens said in the framework of Eurobarometer survey 65.3 that it was easy to compare offers from different mobile phone operators and, in Greece and in Malta, this reaches 75% and 73% of the poll (see Table 4.37). In fact, in Greece, nearly half (47%) of those surveyed said this exercise was 'very easy'. However, while 13% of Europeans, including 25% in Cyprus and 24% in the UK, were unable to give an answer to this question, a very substantial 38% of the poll found the process difficult. This includes particularly high figures of 58% in Denmark and 63% in Sweden. As these last two countries are two of the most abundant users of mobile telephony, with a take-up rate of 96% compared with an EU average of 85% 12 , it is interesting that price comparisons seem more difficult in well-developed and competitive markets. This argument gains further weight from the fact that the countries which saw the highest proportion of their polls saying that price comparison was 'very difficult' were again Denmark (30%) and Sweden (27%) compared with an EU-25 average of just 14%. 12 According to the same survey, where usage rate is valued among EU citizens having access to mobile telephone services, that is to say 92% of the population surveyed.

As education levels rose, the task also appeared to get easier, 38% of those who had left school aged 15 or less considered price comparison easy compared with 53% of those educated to age 19 and 48% of those educated to age 20 or beyond.

        "4. Information Society 126 (cid:4) Overall, 29% of EU-25 mobile telephone users had looked at the option to change provider (see Table 4.39). What, however, emerges is the enormous variation on a country- by-country basis. In Finland, more than half (52%) of mobile phone users had considered this action and 40% of Danes gave the same reply. At the other end of the scale, figures of just 7% are noted in Portugal, 10% in Malta and 14% in Cyprus. This might be explained by the extent of competition in these countries. Making up the group of people who had actually switched mobile provider over the past two years is a substantial figure of a quarter (24%) of EU-25 citizens. Of these, 20% said the switching process was easy and this figure includes nearly a third (29%) of Danes and Austrians, and a substantial 47% of Finns. This means that in one of the EU's most developed mobile phone markets virtually half of mobile telephone users have changed operator without problem in the past 24 months. Making up the 4% of citizens who have switched but who said that the process was difficult were figures of twice the EU average, i.e. 8% in Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands. Younger people who are highly active users of mobile phones were more prone to switching and 37% of 15-24 year olds have considered doing this as opposed to just 19% of those aged 55 or more. As education levels rose, the likelihood of switching provider also increased. Accordingly, 23% of the least educated group had considered this option compared with 32% of those educated to age 20 or beyond and 36% of those still studying where age and education come together to increase this offer.

Information Society (cid:4) 127 According to Table 4.40, 63% of EU-25 citizens who are using the service believe that the terms and conditions of their contract with their mobile telephone service provider are fair and particularly high levels of satisfaction are noted in Finland (88%), Denmark (85%) and Cyprus (82%). At the other end of the scale are the views of French and Italian mobile users where only 42% and 45% respectively hold this opinion. Knowledge of these terms and conditions appears to be relatively low in certain Member States, with 19% of the Dutch and 18% of Estonians admitting that they either did not know or they did not understand the terms and conditions of their contract.

Relatively high levels of complaint were seen in the UK, Austria and Italy where this group made up 15% of their country's poll while slightly higher figures of 16% were seen in Finland and Sweden (see Table 4.41). Younger people were more inclined to complain and making up the 12% EU-25 average were 15% of those aged 15-24 compared with just 7% of those aged 55 or more (see Table 4.42). There was also a marked increase in complaint level by level of education. While just 7% of those educated to age 15 voiced a complaint, this figure doubled to 14% amongst those educated to age 20 or more. While there were no noticeable changes by household composition, the self-employed (18%) and managers (16%) were the most vociferous by occupation, while smaller figures were observed amongst manual workers (10%), house persons (9%) and the retired (7%).

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 129 Protection of consumer interests: 20% don't know the situation Across the European Union, only 51% of the surveyed citizens believed that consumer interests were well- protected in the area of mobile telephone services (see Table 4.43). This is not a particularly strong figure as only 44% of EU-25 citizens believed that consumer interests were fairly well protected and just 7% said that they were very well protected. In addition, a relatively large proportion (19%) said that they did not know the true situation on this issue. Citizens of Luxembourg and Cyprus, however, held positive views on this issue which led to 73% and 74% respectively of these countries' participants stating that they believed consumers' interests to be well-protected. In France and Greece, however, citizens believe that consumer interests are badly protected and this view is held by 44% of the French and 42% of the Greek. Contributing to the EU-25 average of 19% of the persons surveyed who did not give an answer to this question were 29% of Lithuanians.

The 'don't know' factor amongst people aged 55 or more at 34% is just three points away from the 31% noted amongst those who had left school aged 15 or less (see Table 4.44). In a similar way, the 14% 'don't know' factor amongst those educated to age 20 or more and the 10% figure for those still studying is very close to the 11% noted amongst those aged 15-24. This is a powerful indicator that older people - perhaps through lack of interest and thereby information - have a large percentage of their number who are not well informed on this question and a similar proportion is noted amongst those where the lack of education is a probable driver for these high figures. The 'don't know' factor amongst men is 16% compared with 22% amongst women. There are substantial variations on the 'don't know' responses to this question by occupation. While 10% of managers and white-collar workers gave this response, it rises to 24% of house persons and 36% of the retired. Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:46 Page 129 ",

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 131 According to the Eurobarometer survey (64.4 - E- Communications Household Survey) carried out in 2006, almost everybody has telephone access from the home location (either via a fixed or mobile phone) but the proportion of households having both fixed and mobile access at home is considerably lower (61% at EU-25 level). It appears that 18% of households still only have fixed access. To complement that picture, it is interesting to examine the share of households that only have mobile telephone access. At European level, 18% of households stated they had access to one or several mobile phones but no fixed telephone access (the remaining 3% stated not having fixed nor mobile telephone access). The highest figures for households having mobile phone access only and no fixed telephone access were observed in Lithuania and Finland (see Figure 4.45). Results are also relatively high in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia where around four in ten households gave the same response. All these countries have overall telephone access rates below the EU average to the exception of Finland where penetration reaches 100%. On the other hand, not even one in ten households in Sweden, Malta, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are mobile-only users. However, these countries rank highest for the proportion of households having both fixed and mobile access. In the European countries that are not (yet) EU Member States, the proportion of households only having mobile phone access at home is more or less in line with the EU- 25 average. Only in Croatia there are fewer households having only mobile access.

They were asked if they would give up their landline if they could use a mobile phone at the same price as the fixed line for local and national calls. Overall in Europe, one in four households would give up its landline if mobile phone charges were at the same level. In Malta, Estonia and Poland, as many as four in ten households would give up their fixed line (see Figure 4.46). At the other end of the scale, with figures of more than seven out of ten, the 'no' response prevails in Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. The reasons for this negative response would require complementary data gathering and analysis. Even if access to the Internet is cited by 26% of households as a reason to hold on to their fixed line, it should be noted that it is not the most important reason. Only in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and the Czech Republic it is this reason the most frequently cited one. Unfortunately, the survey did not offer answers allowing differentiating the reasons other than those of ensuring Internet access. Respondents were also asked to give their personal opinion about mobile telephony. They were asked to cite what was, in their view, the most important benefit of mobile telephony.

Underlining the subjective importance of mobile telephony, one-third of EU- 25 respondents indicated that they have the security of knowing that they can make calls from anywhere if things go wrong. Another third of those surveyed indicated they have the possibility to be contacted everywhere at any time. Two in ten also mentioned the possibility of having the freedom to make calls when they are out and about. The security aspect is cited by a majority of respondents in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Sweden and the Netherlands (see Figure 4.47). It is also the most frequently mentioned answer in Denmark, Malta, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany and Lithuania. In Portugal, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, a majority agrees on the benefit of being contacted at any place at any time. Also among Slovenians, Latvians, Poles, Finns, Irish, Italians, Estonians and Hungarians, this is seen as the most important benefit of mobile telephony. In Greece, an equal proportion of respondents cited both benefits whereas, in Spain and Austria, respondents tended to refer more often to the possibility of being contacted anywhere and the freedom to make calls when they are out and about. The possibility to be contacted at any place, any time tops the ranking in all four non-EU Member States. Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:46 Page 133 ",
        "4. Information Society 134 (cid:4) Since 97% of EU-25 households access the Internet via a computer. Internet access via other means is relatively rare (6% via mobile phone, 2% via television) 13 . Hence, an examination of figures on the penetration of PCs in households by country is interesting. As can be seen in Figure 4.48, Dutch households appear to be the best equipped. They are followed closely by Swedish and Danish households. In these three countries, more than seven in ten households have a personal computer. In addition, more than half of the households in Luxembourg, Finland, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Malta and Germany have a personal computer. This means also that in 14 European Union countries, the penetration rate of personal computers is under the 50% mark. The lowest rates are observed in Greece, Portugal, Slovakia and Latvia. 4.3 INTERNET ACCESS AND USAGE F igure 4.48 Percentage of households having at least one computer, 2006 % 0% 0 2 % 0 4 % 0 6 % 0 8 % 0 0 1 -25 U E T M R F E B K U I S I F U L K D E S L N R T G B O R R H L E T P K S V L T L U H L P Z C E I E E Y C S E T I T A E D Source : Eurobarometer 64.4 (E-Communications Household Survey), European Commission, 2006 13 Results of the Eurobarometer survey 64.4 on residential use of e-communications conducted by the European Commission in 2006.

Figure 4.49 depicts the proportion of households with Internet at home. The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark top the ranking. In Luxembourg, Finland and the United Kingdom, more than 50% of households have Internet access from home. Among the new Member States, Slovenian households are the best off with 45% of them with Internet access at home. This is 3 points more than the EU-15 average. Other new Member States are found at the bottom of the ranking, together with two EU-15 Member States, Portugal and Greece. 31% of Croatian households have Internet access, but households in Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania lag far behind. Internet penetration can be high despite narrowband Regarding households' means of access to the Internet, Figure 4.50 compares narrowband penetration rates with broadband penetration rates. Overall, a majority of household's internet accesses in Europe are now broadband. Indeed, broadband Internet penetration rate is 23% among EU-25 households whereas narrowband Internet penetration rate is 16%. As might be expected broadband access is more established in those countries with higher Internet penetration rates. However this is not the case in Luxembourg, Slovenia and Germany, countries that have Internet penetration rates above the EU-25 average. In these three countries narrowband access is still prevalent. The penetration rate of narrowband Internet access was also higher than average in the Netherlands and Sweden, but this is due to the fact that in these countries the level of overall Internet access is very high. It is also clear that among the EU-25 countries, narrowband is still the far most important connection mode in Greece, Ireland, Cyprus and Italy whereas the share of narrowband access within total Internet access remains very high in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In countries where broadband is well established, the ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) connection is still used by a majority. In France, Internet connection in homes is by means of ADSL for eight in ten households. The cable TV network, on the other hand, is more widespread in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal, as well as in Bulgaria and Romania. The standard narrowband connection via dial-up line is used by a majority in Ireland, Croatia, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Finland: 4% access the Internet via the mobile network The case of Finland deserves particular attention since 47% of Finnish households indicate that they are 'mobile only'. How do they access the Internet? Results show that 57% of 'mobile only' households have an Internet access at home. From these, 69% access the Internet through ADSL, 14% through cable TV, 11% via a dial-up connection using a standard telephone line or ISDN and 4% via the mobile network.

        "4. Information Society (cid:4) 137 In addition to the above findings as regards households' means of access to the Internet, it is also possible to provide some explanation as to why narrowband is still such a widespread means of Internet access. Indeed, households with narrowband access were asked to indicate why they do not have broadband Internet access in the framework of Eurobarometer survey 64.4 (e- communications household survey). Interestingly the most frequently cited reason is the price of broadband (22%). An almost equal proportion of households indicated that they are satisfied with the current speed of their dial-up connection (20%) as who cited that they do not use the Internet enough. 14% of European households indicated that their area is not covered by broadband technology. Lastly, 13% of households plan to subscribe to broadband within the next two months. Broadband could tempt more households, if cheaper or bundled with other services Respondents living in households connected to the Internet through narrowband were then asked what factors might influence them to switch to broadband. Almost half of the respondents would be willing to change to broadband Internet if they could do so without paying fixed telephone line rental charges. About the same proportion would switch to broadband if the service was 20% cheaper, whereas only one in three would switch if broadband was 10% cheaper. Furthermore, one in three seems to favour a package offering Internet and television channels. Similarly, respondents living in households with a broadband Internet access were requested for their personal view regarding a switch to more satisfactory services. A package of television services and the Internet could probably persuade 31% of respondents to switch services, while a package of mobile telephony services and the Internet could attract 28% of them. 25% of respondents were in favour of keeping the broadband Internet service but dropping the fixed telephone service. When offered a list of statements regarding an upgrading of the broadband service to an even higher speed service, 38% would be willing to have the higher speed service without having a telephone line. One in three would switch to higher speed broadband if they could buy the service as part of a package, together with television channels. However, the issue of price appears to provoke some reluctance: only 10% of respondents would switch to higher speed broadband if the service was 20% more expensive than the current one. This proportion rises to 19% if the service was 10% more expensive. General consensus in the EU concerning Internet affordability Respondents to Eurobarometer survey 65.3 on consumers' opinions of services of general interest who said that they were users of Internet services were asked whether they thought the service is affordable or not. There was a general consensus across the European Union amongst users that Internet services, be they dial-up or broadband, were affordable and this was a view held by 80% of those surveyed. In this respect, there is no difference between dial-up and broadband users. In fact, in Greece and Lithuania, this is an opinion voiced by 90% of users and figures of 89% are seen in both the United Kingdom and Germany (see Table 4.52). While, on average, only 9% of internet users throughout the European Union see the services as being not affordable, a different view on pricing is taken by Cypriots, Finns (19% for both) and Poles (29%). Despite figures of 20% in Malta, 16% in Poland and 13% in Italy and Hungary, a minimal 6% of the total EU internet user survey said that they thought prices were excessive. Compared with a EU-25 4% average, high 'don't know' factors were present in Poland (10%) and Ireland (15%). SATISFACTION AND PRICES Chapter4_Draft_170407.qxp 25/09/2007 15:46 Page 137 ",

By asking this question, those EU citizens who do not use the service for purely economic reasons can be identified. The sample size here is relatively small and in some countries it is less than 100 but, nevertheless, analysis on a country-by-country basis is undertaken. However, readers should be aware that the sample is still relatively small and that caution should be exercised in interpreting this data. Across the European Union, 38% of the persons who had access to the Internet but had not taken up the service said that the reason was not financial as it was affordable to them (see Table 4.53). In this group, particularly high figures were seen in the United Kingdom (50%) and in Luxembourg and Slovenia (both 51%). A substantial third of this group of persons having access but not taking up the service (34%), however, appeared to be uncertain as to the price of connecting to the internet and gave a 'don't know' response. Particularly high figures in this group were noted in Latvia (63%), Ireland (60%) and Finland (58%). Financial constraints were, however, observed in part of the survey and 21% said that the price of Internet connection was not affordable and figures as high as 38% were noted in Greece and Slovakia. Additionally, 8% of the EU-25 citizens involved in this segment of the survey deemed the price of Internet connection to be excessive and this figure reaches 25% in Slovakia. Ultimately, it is noted that three out of ten Europeans are excluded from using the Internet because they cannot afford to be connected.

        "4. Information Society 140 (cid:4) Competition not limited to telephony With the progressive liberalisation of telecommunications, consumer choice has expanded at a rapid pace over the past decade. A number of new communications providers (as opposed to incumbent, national providers) have entered the EU market (see Table 4.55) and started to compete on price and service, increasingly attracting households with bundled packages (see next section). It is important that in a well-operating free market it is easy for consumers to compare prices. In the area of Internet, a first stumbling block would appear to be the fact that there are high levels of 'don't know' - answers: 27% of EU-25 respondents to Eurobarometer survey 65.3 on consumers' opinions of services of general interest (see Table 4.56). However, it should be remembered that usage of broadband, although growing rapidly, still reaches just 47% of citizens across the Union and dial-up just 28% i.e. a total of 75% of EU citizens. In the light of these figures, the 27% 'don't know' factor may be seen as being relatively small. Generally, European citizens found it easy (43%) rather than difficult (30%) to compare offers from different internet service providers be they dial-up or broadband. Comparing offers of providers considered very difficult by 16% in Germany and Denmark Greeks (26%) and Czechs (22%), in fact, found the process very easy compared with 19% of Slovaks and 16% of Germans and Danes who found the exercise very difficult compared with an EU-25 average of 11%.

The proportion of the poll who had not considered switching varies substantially across the EU. The largest segment (64%) of Internet users were not interested in switching, and, among this group, the highest percentages were observed in Slovenia (82%) and Cyprus (86%). Seven percent of users across the EU had been put off even trying to move providers because they thought the process would be too difficult and these figures rise to 12% in Portugal and 13% in Ireland. Of the 4% of Internet users who had tried unsuccessfully to move providers and had given up due to difficulties in making the transfer were 6% of the Dutch poll and 5% of the French and Polish. Thirty-two percent of Dutch internet users, 30% of the French and 28% of those living in Germany had thought about moving Internet provider in the past two years compared with just 5% of people in Cyprus. The Cypriot attitude on the internet mirrors the responses given on the island to questions on fixed telephone lines and mobile phone services, where respondents seem content to stay with their existing provider. Whether this is because of satisfaction with the existing service provider or the absence of competition is unclear. It is a strong possibility that as the Internet market expands becoming more developed and competitive, the pressure on customers to change providers will increase due to service providers having to make stronger marketing efforts to gain or retain market share.

Operators and providers offer a variety of services for a single global price. One of the purposes of Eurobarometer survey 64.4 15 was to provide a clearer picture of this aspect. Some form of bundling already adopted in 18% of EU households Surveyed households were presented a list of services and asked to indicate if they purchased two or more services as part of one or more service packages at a single price. It was observed that these relatively new 'service packages' have already been adopted by certain proportion of households in several EU-25 countries. Overall, at EU-25 level, 18% of households have subscribed to at least one service package (see Figure 4.61).

Some interesting observations emerged when respondents were asked to give their personal opinion regarding services packages. Table 4.63 presents the results. It would appear that opinion is split between those respondents who receive some e-communications services via a service package and those who indicated that their household had not purchased such a package. Those who had made use of the service package(s) are far less inclined to answer that these packages are not interesting due to the fact that they include services that they do not really need. More than half of these respondents indicated that they considered service packages are more convenient since they only have to pay one invoice.

Postal services are key to consumers' daily life, both as senders and as receivers of mail (invoices, bank statements, advertising, \u2026) T able 5.1 Postal services - network access, 2005 (units) Permanent post offices ( 1 ) Average number of inhabitants served by a permanent post office ( 1 ) Post- boxes ( 2 ) BE 1 409 7 395 19 000 CZ 3 416 2 992 24 107 DK 945 5 747 9 190 DE 12 671 6 526 108 000 EE 544 2 444 3 786 EL 2 093 5 313 11 639 ES 3 291 12 958 33 063 FR 17 008 3 557 145 000 IE 1 570 2 642 6 200 IT 13 831 4 200 62 000 CY 1 111 743 998 LV 975 2 366 2 300 LT 949 3 615 4 141 LU 107 4 345 1 153 HU 2 844 3 551 15 487 MT 51 7 875 472 NL 3 191 5 108 19 540 AT 1 947 4 206 20 539 PL 8 350 4 614 56 623 PT 2 889 3 633 18 232 SI 558 3 525 3 068 SK 1 586 3 405 7 096 FI 1 276 4 114 8 000 SE 1 980 4 566 30 000 UK 14 376 4 151 113 000 BG 3 136 2 464 5 306 HR 1 159 3 927 5 286 RO 6 811 3 188 12 611 TR 4 341 16 861 56 777 Consumer access to postal services relies on postal access points such as post offices, agencies and also of post boxes. There were some 99 thousand post offices in the EU in 2005 (see Table 5.1). This number has decreased in most Member States during the past decade, which could be to the detriment of the consumer interest (especially in remote areas) Each permanent office served on average 4600 persons in the EU in 2005, ranging between almost one per seven hundred inhabitants in Cyprus, up to close to one for every thirteen thousand inhabitants in Spain.

        "5. Postal Services (cid:4) 155 94% of all posted items remain 'national' Approximately 102 billion letter-post items were handled in 2005 by European postal services. This figure includes letters, postcards, printed matter and small packets, but excludes parcels or newspapers. Most posted items are addressed to domestic recipients, as national traffic accounted for 94.4% of the total (sum of domestic traffic, international dispatch and international receipt). Most postal traffic in circulation in Europe originates from business. Although the information dates back to 1997, it is generally estimated that only a tenth of all mail that is posted in the EU is from households, whilst two-thirds of all mail is addressed to them 1 . Combining postal traffic with demographic data, there were, on average, some 220 letter-post items sent per inhabitant in 2005, ranging from 55 items in Greece up to more than 520 in Finland (see Table 5.9). It is important to note that these figures relate to the number of letter-post items treated by the national post for domestic service and international dispatch, and they do not distinguish between private and business use. 1 Post 2005, Universal Postal Union, 1997.

An additional EUR 0.21 was generally required to send them crossborder to another EU country via priority mail. However, as shown in Table 5.11, stamp prices vary considerably across the EU, often by a factor of three. Malta, Slovenia and the Czech Republic offered the lowest national rates, at EUR 0.16, EUR 0.20 and EUR 0.25 per item respectively, whilst the highest prices were found in Sweden (EUR 0.59), Italy (EUR 0.60), Denmark (EUR 0.64) and Finland (EUR 0.70). For intra-EU cross-border traffic, the highest prices were found in Sweden (EUR 1.19), more than 3.5 times the Czech tariff (EUR 0.34). However it can be noticed that the price for intra-EU cross- border traffic in the new Member States was relatively high, exceeding always EUR 0.40 per item, with the exception of the Czech Republic (EUR 0.34) and Malta (EUR 0.37).

These figures can be contrasted with an EU-25 average of 87%.

A high figure of 18% was noted also in Sweden followed by a 13% (double the EU average) in Poland, France and the Czech Republic. Of note, was a high 'don't know' factor of 6% in Cyprus compared with a minimal EU-25 average figure of 1%.

        "5. Postal Services 160 (cid:4) Respondents who are not users of the postal service were asked whether they thought it is affordable or not. The sample size of those EU-25 citizens who have access to postal services (both sending and receiving) but do not use them is too small in a large number of the countries polled to allow a meaningful analysis on a country-by-country basis. Taking this category of respondents from a global EU perspective, two-thirds (65%) said that they could afford postal services. A further 12%, were unsure of the cost of the service (see Table 5.15), 15% said that postal services were not affordable while a further 8% stating that they considered these prices to be excessive. Amongst those EU-25 citizens who did not use postal services (7%, see Figure 5.7), there was a noticeable variation in those who were unaware of the pricing of this facility and therefore replied 'don't know' (12%). Figures ranged from 9% of the youngest age band (which may be explained by these using electronic modes of communication) to 15% aged 55 or more. A similar spread was seen when education levels were studied. While just 7% of those educated to age 20 or more gave this response, the figure more than doubles to 17% for those whose education had ended at age 15 or less. Amongst those who did not use postal services (7%, see Figure 5.7 - but included in the statistical population which relates to Table 5.15), a large proportion still deemed it to be affordable. This was the response given by 72% of those aged 15 to 24 and a similar percentage (74%) of those educated to 20 or more. At the other end of the scale, just one percentage point separated the 58% of those educated to age 15 or less from the 59% of those aged 55 or more who also responded in this way.

        "5. Postal Services (cid:4) 161 Practically the entire EU population had its mail delivered directly to their homes in 2005 (see Table 5.16), and there was at least one delivery per day in urban areas (including Saturdays), and almost as many in rural areas. As regards delivery speed, the current Postal Directive (Directive 97/67/EC as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC) establishes cross-border quality targets that should be met for the benefit of consumers. These targets are 85% delivery within three days and 98% delivery within five days. According to the International Post Corporation, the actual performance of postal operators surpasses these objectives (see Figure 5.17). They state that in 2005, some 93.9% of cross-border priority mail was delivered within three days of posting, up from 69.1% in 1994. The average delivery time in Europe was 2.2 days, an enhancement of half a day since 1998 and almost one full day since 1994. The Commission's aim is to accomplish the Single Market for postal services and ensure a high quality universal service, by opening up the sector to competition in a gradual and controlled way on the basis of the regulatory framework of the Postal Directive. The improvement of the quality of service, in particular in terms of delivery performance and convenient access are fundamental aspects of this policy. In October 2006, the Commission adopted a proposal to take the last step to accomplish the internal market in the postal area. This proposal removes the option Member States have to finance universal service through a monopoly while fully maintaining universal service. Any universal service financing mechanisms which is compatible with the EC Treaty is allowed, except monopolies.

        "5. Postal Services 162 (cid:4) Waiting times are perceived as a difficulty In the framework of Eurobarometer survey 65.3 regarding consumers' opinions of services of general interest, conducted in 2006, those respondents who said they had difficulty accessing or had no access to postal services were asked which particular difficulties they had encountered. The main problems seen by this group of respondents related to the fact that not only was the nearest post office too far away and possibly had inconvenient opening hours but, having got there, the waiting time could also be considered to be too long. This sample, which is less than 10% of the total poll, when broken down by country produces results which should be viewed with caution as the sample size is often just double- digit. Accordingly, the broad findings are based upon the total sample across the EU and are not analysed on a country-by-country basis for this reason. The two major difficulties in accessing postal services were, as seen above, distance of the service from home or work (mentioned by 36% of respondents) and waiting times in the post office (raised by 31% of respondents - see Table 5.18). There was a noticeable difference by respondents' residence with 48% of this segment who lived in rural villages complaining about the distance compared with just 26% in small towns and 33% in large towns. There were minor variations by age, gender or education when waiting times were reviewed. Managers (37%) were more impatient than all other occupations. Again, there was a marked variation between the 14% of people living in rural villages who complained about long waiting times compared with 45% in small towns and 38% in large towns.

Once again, the sample of respondents saying that they had difficult or no access to postal services was small, so results should be looked at with care. The two negative responses ('no, not really' and 'no, not at all') and the two positive responses ('yes a great deal' and 'yes, to some extent') are presented together in Table 5.19 in order to give a broad overview of respondents' attitudes on this issue. For the approximately 10% of EU citizens who have difficulty in accessing postal services, this has a negative effect on the daily life of less than half (44%) of the respondents, of which 7% 'a great deal'.. People in middle age (40 to 54) were more concerned over this issue (48%). When looking at the breakdown, by occupation, this attitude was expressed by 50% of the self-employed and managers compared with just 38% of the retired and 33% of students.

        "6. Banking Services 166 (cid:4) Financial services can be defined as services of a banking, credit, insurance, investment or payment nature. They are offered to consumers to help manage their financial situation or manage risk. One main role is to facilitate transactions through payment services. In addition, they can also help ensure financial protection against accidents, damage to property or health problems (through insurance) and they can provide financial liquidity and a way of building assets over a lifetime (through the granting credit on the one hand, and through savings and investments on the other hand). Insurance and financial services represented 2.9% of total household expenditure in 1999 in the EU-15, ranging between 0.3% in Germany and 11.6% in the Netherlands. It is important to note that the only expenditure items considered in the Household Budget Survey are the charges associated with financial services (bank charges, brokerage fees, tax and pension counselling and service charges for insurance) and not the capital or interest payments (investments) themselves. When excluding insurance, household expenditure amounted to 35 PPS per household at EU-15 level in 1999. Looking at the available data for the individual Member States, expenditure ranged between 2 PPS in Finland to 71 PPS in Luxembourg (see Figure 6.1). F igure 6.1 Financial services n.e.c.

One could even argue that basic banking services do not qualify for such a label, but against the background of social inclusion, this topic should be covered (see box). Financial inclusion: Should a bank account and a payment card be a basic right? Many people, particularly those living on low incomes, cannot access mainstream financial products such as bank accounts and low cost loans. Access to finance is a basic service that appears to be essential for citizens to be economically and socially integrated in today's society. It is a prerequisite for employment economic growth, poverty reduction and social inclusion. A lack of access imposes real costs on individuals and their families - often the most vulnerable people in our society. Families can be locked in a cycle of poverty and exclusion, or turn to high cost credit or even illegal lenders, resulting in greater financial strain and unmanageable debt. Is the tackling of financial exclusion then a responsibility of financial services providers? The topic is being discussed at national level (especially in the United Kingdom) and certain action plans have been launched. However, financial exclusion calls for a European exchange and debate. In the framework of the 2002-2006 Community action programme to combat social exclusion, a study already considered the role of micro-credits and related services. Gradually, the concept of micro-credits was replaced by the broader micro-finance, which includes access to bank accounts, investments and insurance. The thematic study Financial services provision and prevention of social exclusion launched in 2006 will identify and analyse the most effective policy measures to promote and guarantee access to financial services.

        "6. Banking Services (cid:4) 167 Most households principal access to retail financial services is through their local bank or an automatic teller machine (ATM), though an increasing number of persons handle their routine banking operations through internet banking. There was a status quo in terms of the number of local branches between 1994 and 2000 1 and a slight decrease from 2001, whilst the number of ATMs increased. More than 200 thousand local branches and almost 260 thousand ATMs existed in the EU 2 in 2005. As such, there was, on average, one local branch for each 2.2 thousand inhabitants and one ATM for each 1.7 thousand inhabitants. Network access was the lowest in the Czech Republic and in Lithuania, where there were less than 23 local branches and less than 30 ATMs per 100 thousand inhabitants. On the other hand, there were around 100 branches and 125 ATMs per 100 thousand inhabitants in Spain.

        "6. Banking Services 168 (cid:4) Definitions Bank current account and debit card Bank current account: deposit account offering day-to-day money management facilities such as various flexible payment methods to allow customers to transfer money directly to others. Among standard services of current accounts we may find a cheque book, the facility to arrange standing orders and direct debits, withdraw cash from an ATM and make payments via a debit card. A Current account does not include a saving account where no payment facilities are available. Debit card: A card that may be used to make electronic payments taking funds directly from the linked current account. Credit/store cards Credit cards (VISA, AMEX, MASTERCARD, DINERS \u2026) are characterised by a specific credit facility: money is lent to people between the time they purchase goods and the time of full repayment of the amount; an interest is to be paid on any balance that is not cleared at the end of the month. There are monthly statements for the money spent specifying the minimum amount to be paid. Credit cards are not bank debit cards, where the money spent on the card is immediately deducted from a linked bank account. In a Eurobarometer survey (63.2) carried out in 2005 respondents were asked to select from a list of financial services all those which they personally have. The results stemming from this indirect approach represent the types of financial products which first come to mind and items selected are generally those which are primarily used by respondents. It is important to note that the given response rate should not be misinterpreted as implying that the remaining proportion of respondents do not have the corresponding item. The advantage of this \u2018multiple answers\u2019 approach to questions is that it enables to rank ownership of financial products and their role among EU citizens according to respondents' declaration of those which they personally have. As indicated above, this ranking is best interpreted as being representative of the items most frequently used. Current account with payment card most popular service According to Table 6.3 \u2018a current account which comes with a payment card and/or a chequebook\u2019 seems to be by far the most popular financial service among European Union citizens with seven in ten confirming that they have such an account. A marked difference in results is, however, observed between the EU-15 group (74%) and the new Member States (52%). Following next, 34% of EU citizens say that they have \u2018a credit card\u2019. Here again, there is a marked distinction in results between the EU of 15 (38%) and the new Member States (15%). 30% state that they have \u2018a deposit account which pays interests, but has no payment card or chequebook\u2019 (EU-15: 34% and NMS-10: 10%). The results focus on the item which was, by far, cited by most respondents: a current account which comes with a payment card and/or a chequebook. The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Slovenia and Finland stand out at the upper end of the scale with over four in five stating that they have such an account. The situation in Greece, however, seems to be different from the rest of Europe with only one in ten stating that they have a current account. This could be partly explained by the fact that it was only as recently as the early 1990s that the market was opened to private banks. It would seem that deposit accounts without a payment card or chequebook are more popular with 59% stating that they have this type of account. Those who studied the longest as well as managers and those who trust the advice given by financial institutions stand out for the relatively high proportion which cites a current account which comes with a payment card and/or a chequebook as being a financial service which they personally have. It can therefore be assumed that this product is primarily used by respondents of this profile. A comparatively high proportion of respondents in Luxembourg (65%), Sweden (64%) and France (62%) confirm that they have a personal \u2018credit card\u2019 compared to only 10% in Hungary and 13% in Slovakia. Another striking result is that 68% of Belgians have taken the first step towards saving by opening a deposit account. Chapter6_Draft_260207.qxp 12/10/2007 15:58 Page 168 ",

Banking Services 170 (cid:4) Compared with an EU average of 88%, 97% of Finns and Danes said that they had easy access to the banking system through a current account 3 and high figures were also noted in Spain (96%) and in Luxembourg (95% - see Table 6.4). No access to banking services for 2% of EU citizens Sixteen percent of Italians, 15% of Latvians and 12% of Slovaks said that they had difficult access to this service compared with an EU-25 average of just 7%. Italians, in fact, do not appear to benefit from a widespread banking network and 8% of this country's poll says they have no access to this service. This was also the situation with 7% of Hungarians and 6% of Latvians compared to an average of just 2% across the Union. Seven percent of Italians and Hungarians did not give a response to this question - more than three times the EU average.

        "6. Banking Services 172 (cid:4) Making up the 34% average of EU-25 citizens who said that the difficulty they had with current account banking was the distance from the branch were 43% of those educated to age 20 or more and just 30% of those who had left school aged 15 or less (see Table 6.6). As might be anticipated, this reason was cited by considerably more people living in rural villages than those living in large towns and figures of 53% and 18% are seen respectively. This geographic problem is also observed when 10% of those living in rural location say that they do not have a means of transport to get to their bank compared with just 4% of those living in large towns. 20% of men consider opening hours of banks as 'not convenient' There appears to be strong feeling about the convenience of bank opening hours amongst certain groups. Accordingly, the EU-25 16% average saying opening hours are not convenient contains figures as varied as 20% for men and 13% for women, 9% for the least educated and 27% for those educated to age 20 or beyond, and even wider differentials between 37% of managers and 33% of white-collar workers compared with just 10% of the retired, 9% of the unemployed and 8% of house persons and students. Efficiency within the bank itself, as demonstrated by waiting times, is cited by 11% of this particular poll. Making up this EU-25 figure, there was 14% of men and 9% of women. No patterns emerged by age or education but occupation was, as might be expected, a driver, with less patience being shown by managers (21%) and white-collar workers (19%) compared with just 11% of the retired, 9% of house persons and 2% of the unemployed.

Debit cards, transfers and other forms of electronic payment are now widespread and the market is still developing, for example with the arrival of electronic purses. In 2005, a special Eurobarometer survey (63.2) looked at Europeans payment preferences for significant purchases (worth more than EUR 100 or its equivalent in national currency) in their own country and in another Member State. Figure 6.7 shows that one in two EU citizens confirms that they prefer to pay for a significant purchase in cash, corresponding to a rise of 3 points since 2003 4 . However, looking at the breakdown of this result for the EU-15 block (45%) and that of the new Member States (69%), this rise is partly explained by the considerably higher result for the latter. The proportion of respondents using a credit card or other bank card for the payment of significant purchases remains identical since 2003. Here again there is considerable discrepancy between the EU-15 group (39%) and the new Member States (21%). 4 Eurobarometer 60.2 (Public Opinion in Europe on Financial Services), European Commission, 2003.

        "6. Banking Services (cid:4) 173 Chequebooks still widespread in France The analysis focuses on the items which bear the greatest weight, cash and credit card or other bank card. However, some of the more noteworthy points with regard to the other payment possibilities can be noted. For instance, three in four of the French own a chequebook and it does not come as a surprise that their preference for paying for significant purchases by cheque stands out at 35%, corresponding to a dip of 2 points since 2003. The proportion of Austrians opting for a bank or postal transfer is also noteworthy at 29%. As was observed in 2003, the average result for those opting for cash masks considerable disparities between countries ranging from 95% of Greeks (+1 point) to 11% of the French (-9 points). In all of the new Member States, with the exception of Estonia, at least one in two respondents prefers to pay for significant purchases in cash. The other Member States where a majority would opt for cash for making significant payments are Greece (95%), Italy (68%), Spain (65%), Portugal (53%), Ireland (52%) and Germany (51%). (repeated from a paragraph above) The use of a credit card or other bank card seems to be more widespread in Sweden (62%), the Netherlands (61%), Luxembourg (59%) and Belgium (58%). Regarding the evolution of the use of credit card or other bank cards in all Member States, the general tendency across Europe is a rising trend in the use of electronic means for the payment of significant purchases. Particularly notable positive evolutions are Luxembourg (59%; +17 points) as well as the Netherlands (61%; +14 points).

At the European level, it seems that payment preferences for significant purchases are split between credit or other bank card (37%; +4 points) and cash (35%; +1 point - see Figure 6.9). When it comes to making a payment with a credit card or other bank card it is worth noting the difference in results between the EU-15 group (38%) and the new Member States (29%). At the national level, a much stronger preference for electronic payments by citizens in the EU-15 group compared to their counterparts in the new Member States was also observed.

        "6. Banking Services (cid:4) 175 The proportion of respondents who spontaneously stated that they never bought anything in another Member State dipped to 14% (-6 points). It seems that one in five of the citizens from the MS having recently joined the EU has not yet made a significant purchase in another Member State compared to 8% of citizens in the 'old' Member States, a disparity which can be expected to decrease with time. The range of results for those preferring to pay for a significant purchase in another Member State using a credit card or other bank card ranges from three in five in the Benelux countries to only 7% in Greece. Over one in two citizens in Greece (57%), Slovenia (56%) and Cyprus (53%) prefer to pay in cash for a significant purchase elsewhere in the European Union. With regard to Greece, we saw earlier that the Greeks stood out with a result of 95% preferring to pay for significant purchases made in their country in cash. Close to or over three in ten respondents in Latvia, Portugal, Hungary and Greece spontaneously indicated that they never bought anything in another Member State. Shopping abroad: increasing popularity of payment cards Regarding the evolution in results in all Member States, it seems that for purchases made in another Member State, equivalent to over EUR 100, the proportion of users opting for card payments increased in practically all Member States, with the exception of Cyprus (where the results remained static), Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and Italy. Contrary to the trend observed for electronic payments for purchases made in another Member State, the tendency for payment in cash for such purchases is declining in most countries. This would suggest that in these countries at least, there has been a switch-over from cash to card for making cross-border payments for purchases equivalent to at least EUR 100. However, the rise in preferences for paying in cash is notable in Slovakia (46%; +14 points), Spain (44%; +11 points) and Greece (57%; +10 points). 7% 15% 23% 25% 26% 28% 30% 30% 30% 31% 32% 34% 36% 36% 39% 42% 42% 45% 46% 47% 50%56% 58% 59% 60% 37% 57% 39% 53% 48% 46% 26% 56% 39% 29% 23% 39% 44% 28% 45% 25%26% 13% 28% 43% 29% 28% 14% 20% 27% 35% 29% 30% 10% 11% 14% 32% 10% 22% 15% 34% 18%11% 16% 12% 15% 24% 5% 4% 10% 9% 2% 8% 14% 6% 6% 6% 7% 18% 2% 6% 8% 9% 3% 14% 3% 6% 5% 4% 4%5% 4% 1% 1% 1%1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 5% 9% 8% 7% 12% 21% 5% 5% 20% 2% 11% 1% 3% 4% 9% 15% 3% 3% 4% 5% 1%1% 1% 2% 3% 4% 13% 1% 1% 2% 2% 6% 1% 2% 2% 2% 3% 2% 2% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 2% 6%1% 3% 4% 4% 3% 10% 1% 2% 2% 9% 6% 3% 3% 6% 3% 6% 6% 3%3% 4% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% EL HU CY IT SK PT SI PL AT LV CZ ES IE DE UK MT EE DK FI LT SE FR NL LU BE EU-25 Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) or other bank card Cash Never bought anything in another Member Country (spontaneous) Bank or Postal Transfer Cheque Other form of payment (spontaneous) Do not know F igure 6.9 Which one of the following means of payment do you prefer to use to pay for a significant purchase of at least 100 Euros in another Member Country of the European Union?

        "6. Banking Services 176 (cid:4) Respondents who generally prefer paying in cash for a significant purchase in another Member State tend to be young, still studying and opt for cash when it comes to paying for significant purchases made in their own country. Those who prefer to pay for a significant purchase by electronic means tend to be more highly educated (have pursued their studies until at least the age of 20), managers, owners of credit cards or other bank cards and prefer this means of payment for significant purchases made nationally. Respondents who spontaneously state that they have never bought anything in another Member State are more inclined to be older, have completed their studies by the age of 15, retired and not in possession of a bank or credit card. As it was seen for significant payments at the national level, ease stands out as the main reason explaining the payment preferences for cross-border purchases of the majority of citizens in each Member State (with the exception of Lithuania where this reason was cited by exactly one in two - see table 6.10).

Banking Services (cid:4) 177 One third allows others to use personal bank card or credit card Focusing specifically on respondents who own a bank card or credit card, close to one in three respondents in the EU confirm that they allowed someone to use their personal bank or credit card. However, a distinction is observed between the results for the EU-15 group (31%) and the new Member States (40%). This average once again masks some differences at the national level: the results range from close to one in two in France (49%) to 14% in the United Kingdom (see Figure 6.11). Respondents who confirmed that they allowed someone to use their personal bank or credit card were then asked to whom they granted permission. A majority of respondents stated that they lent their bank or credit card to their spouse or partner. Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal can be distinguished for the relatively higher proportion of respondents who state they allowed their child to use their bank or credit card.

        "6. Banking Services 178 (cid:4) In the framework of Eurobarometer survey 65.3 on consumers' opinions of services of general interest led in 2006, respondents who were users of bank current account services were asked whether they thought the service was affordable or not. 82% of EU-25 citizens felt that bank current account charges were affordable and, in Lithuania, with a figure of 96%, this is a sentiment felt by virtually all those surveyed (see Table 6.12). Figures of 90% or above were observed in Slovakia (94%), Greece (93%), the UK (92%), the Netherlands (91%) and Austria (90%). However, in Finland, virtually a quarter (24%) of that country's poll said that bank charges were not affordable. High figures were also observed in France (17%) and Cyprus (15%) - considerably more than the 8% average across the Union. A substantial one in five (21%) of Italians felt that bank charges were excessive and relatively high figures were also noted in the Czech Republic where 15% of the poll gave this spontaneous response. 5% of the Portuguese, Cypriot and Irish polls and 6% of the Maltese poll gave a 'don't know' response to this question compared with an EU average of just 1%. There are no significant variations by gender, age and education. The only exception to the 82%- 85% spread by occupation was the 78% noted amongst the unemployed (see Table 6.13).

        "6. Banking Services (cid:4) 179 Respondents who are not holders of bank current accounts were also asked whether they thought the service was affordable or not. This relatively small sample of around 11% of the respondents across the EU-25 contains -samples that in several Member States are too small, making an analysis between countries statistically invalid. Looking at the broad EU-25 figures, however, produces statistics that show 43% of people without bank current accounts had not done this for financial reasons as they considered this service to be affordable. Almost 1 in 3 Europeans that don't have a current account claim that the reason for this is affordability. Indeed, 18% of this 'non-banked' group considered bank current accounts to be unaffordable, while 10% went as far as to spontaneously say that the charges for this service were excessive. A sizeable 29% of the poll, however, did not know what it costs to establish and run a current account and therefore replied 'don't know' to this question. Amongst this group of respondents who gave a 'don't know' response were 36% of those aged 55 or more, 32% of those whose education had ended at age 15 and 41% of the retired. In the Eurobarometer survey 63.2 on financial services carried out in 2005, a series of statements concerning the perceptions of financial institutions and services were shown to respondents who were asked to identify those with which they agree or tend to agree. A given response rate should therefore not be misinterpreted as implying that the remaining proportion of respondents disagrees with the statement in question. This \u2018multiple answers\u2019 approach provides a clear ranking of statements as shown in Table 6.14. The item with which most respondents agree is: \u2018financial transactions are generally secure\u2019 (37%). However, this average result at the level of the European Union of 25 masks a distinction in results between the EU-15 group (40%) and the new Member States (23%). Sticking with positive perceptions, 29% believe that \u2018the confidential information they give to banks or insurance companies is adequately protected\u2019. Here again, the difference between the EU of 15 (32%) and the new Member States (16%) is significant. While on the issue of security, the results of a public at large Flash Eurobarometer survey 5 conducted in November 2002 are somewhat pertinent. The results to the question on encounters with security problems revealed that one in two (48%) spontaneously stated that they never experienced security problems 6 . e l b a d r o f f a t o N e l b a d r o f f A e v i s s e c x E ) s u o e n a t n o p s ( t o n o D w o n k 5 2 - U E 1 8 8 2 8 n o i t a p u c c O d e y o l p m e - f l e S 1 3 1 7 9 7 r e g a n a M 1 7 7 5 8 r a l l o c e t i h w r e h t O 1 8 0 1 2 8 r e k r o w l a u n a M 1 8 8 2 8 n o s r e p e s u o H 2 8 8 2 8 d e y o l p m e n U 3 9 0 1 8 7 d e r i t e R 2 8 8 2 8 t n e d u t S 3 4 7 5 8 T able 6.13 In general, would you say that the price of current bank account services is affordable or not?

        "6. Banking Services 180 (cid:4) On a more negative note, 35% of respondents tend to agree that \u2018having a bank account is expensive\u2019 and the same proportion considers that \u2018the marketing techniques of financial institutions are aggressive\u2019. Regarding the latter statement, the difference between the EU-15 result (38%) and the new Member States (21%) is again notable. In the Nordic Member States and the Netherlands, close to, or over two thirds of respondents identified \u2018financial transactions are generally secure\u2019 as being one of the statements with which they tend to agree the most. However, in six of the new Member States as well as three of the Southern Member States (Portugal, Greece and Italy), less than one third of respondents share this opinion. Denmark and the Netherlands stand out with respectively 59% and 57% of respondents tending to agree that \u2018the confidential information they give to banks or insurance companies is adequately protected\u2019. In contrast, in the Czech Republic only 6% cited this. However, it should be noted that the results in the Czech Republic are particularly low in all instances which is partly explained by the considerably high \u2018don't know\u2019 response rate. Looking at some of the more negative perceptions, Italy (68%) and Ireland (57%) stand out for the particularly high proportions of citizens tending to agree that \u2018having a bank account is expensive\u2019. In the Baltic States, few identified this as one of the statements with which they agree. As many as seven in ten Dutch respondents believe that \u2018the marketing techniques of financial institutions are aggressive\u2019 compared to less than one in ten Lithuanians (9%) and Czechs (7%) who tend to agree with this.
