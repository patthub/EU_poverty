        "9 The mandate of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is to provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU and its Member States with independent, evidence-based assistance and expertise relating to fundamental rights 1 . Data collection, including comparative data collection in the form of survey research, on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU provides the basis for FRA\u2019s assistance and expertise. Roma and Travellers have a long history of experiencing discrimination, persecution and exclusion in Europe 2 . \u2018Roma are still being deprived of their basic human rights in Europe,\u2019 as the European Parliament underlined in its 2019 resolution on the post-2020 Strategic EU Framework for National Roma Inclusion Strategies and the fight against antigypsyism 3 . Following the first and second waves of the European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS I and II) 4 in 2018, the aim of the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 is to collect representative data on the situation of Roma and Travellers in six western European countries that have (with the exception of France) previously not been covered in a multinational comparative survey: Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom 5 . The outputs of the survey will provide a baseline for the new EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation 6 and help in advising the EU and its Member States on measures to effectively ensure the fundamental rights of Roma and Travellers, and their equal social inclusion and participation, and tackle institutional discrimination. Altogether, the results of the upcoming Roma Survey 2020 in seven countries previously covered by EU-MIDIS II, the national data collections on Roma in Slovakia and Bulgaria, and the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 provide baseline data for the new strategic framework to be evaluated at the end of the next decade. Following an EU-wide open call for tenders, FRA commissioned Ipsos MORI, a large international survey company based in the United Kingdom, to carry out the Survey on the Rights and Living Conditions of Roma and Travellers 2018/2019 (Roma and Travellers Survey) in the six survey countries. FRA staff supervised the entire project closely, monitored compliance with high quality standards and followed strict quality control procedures.

        "10 was, however, only possible thanks to the extensive participation of the Roma and Traveller organisations in each country. They supported the preparation and implementation of this survey in their respective countries, making the survey not only about Roma and Travellers but a piece of research that was developed and conducted together with the Roma and Travellers. Interviews were conducted face to face, with trained interviewers using a computerised questionnaire. The survey targeted individuals aged 16 or over who self-identified as having a Roma or Traveller background (or any group subsumed under these umbrella terms), who lived in private households and whose usual place of residence was the survey country for at least six of the 12 months before the survey. The survey collected information from 4 659 respondents in Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom and concerning 8 234 individuals living in the respondents\u2019 households (i.e. 12 893 Roma and Travellers in total) and about the infrastructure of the halting site or neighbourhood 7 . The fieldwork took place from December 2018 until July 2019 through face-to-face interviews. The results of the survey are published in the main results report, Roma and Travellers in Six Countries 8 . All survey tools were set up to ensure comparability between survey countries, between target groups and with the data of the previous survey (EU-MIDIS II) and in view of the upcoming Roma Survey in 2020\u20132021. Sampling and survey strategies had to be tailored to each country, in the absence of comprehensive sample frames; i.e. reliable data on the population sizes, sociodemographic characteristics and places of residence were lacking, leading to difficulties in reaching the populations and to the necessity to build these frames, limit the target population or adapt the sampling methodologies. Extensive country-specific background research was conducted, which included mapping and constructing sample frames of Roma and Traveller subgroups in consultation with national Roma contact points, experts from academia, national and local civil society organisations, and administrative bodies, as well as secondary research. The methodology of the background research is outlined in Chapter 1. The main methodological results and key findings are incorporated in the descriptions of the corresponding project steps (e.g. sampling, fieldwork, weighting). The questionnaire was developed, reviewed and finalised as described in Chapter 2, and supporting survey materials were drafted. The translation process (Chapter23) was followed by the pilot survey, which was conducted 7 Roma and Travellers in the UK living in bricks-and-mortar housing, Roma living in camps or houses and Travellers living outside halting sites in France were excluded, as it was not possible to obtain a representative sample. 8 FRA (2020), Roma and Travellers in Six Countries , Publications Office of the European Union (Publications Office), Luxembourg, doi:10.2811/30472. \u2018Roma\u2019 and \u2018Travellers\u2019 are used as umbrella terms according to the definition of the Council of Europe. They encompass Roma, Sinti, Kale, Romanichals, Boyash/Rudari, Balkan Egyptians, Eastern groups (Dom, Lom and Abdal) and groups such as Travellers, Yenish and the populations designated under the administrative term Gens du voyage, as well as people who identify themselves as Gypsies. The Agency, like the Council of Europe, adds the term \u2018Travellers\u2019 as necessary to highlight actions that specifically include them.

        "11 between August and October 2018, resulting in 52 interviews in total (Chapter 5). The pilot provided crucial insights into the feasibility of the survey and sampling approaches in each country and with each target group, and helped to define reasonable sample sizes and to design appropriate and workable approaches for the main-stage fieldwork. These insights are reflected in the chapters on sampling and fieldwork (Chapters 4 and 6, respectively). While the sampling approach at household and respondent levels differed between countries \u2013 taking into account the challenges of unavailability of registers and unknown population sizes \u2013 all applied a random probability sampling approach when selecting the locations (primary sampling units (PSUs) and, if applicable, secondary sampling units (SSUs)) where the fieldwork took place. Within PSUs and SSUs, random selection of households and respondents was implemented in France, the Netherlands (Traveller/Sinti) and the United Kingdom. In Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden, a non-random approach based on quotas was employed (see Chapter 4). The technical aspects of the fieldwork are explained in detail in Chapter 6, and the data processing and weighting in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 9 sheds light on the quality of the data, and reviews critically the quality but also the limitations of the data, along five quality dimensions. Chapter 10 sets out the lessons learned during the project. ",

BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION Given the specific nature of the population surveyed, and the lack of data on the number and geographical spread of Roma and Travellers across the selected six countries, the initial stage of the project consisted of thorough background research and stakeholder consultations to collect information on possible sampling frames and survey approaches and to gain insight into the local Roma and Traveller communities. The background research consisted of: \u2015 the country teams reviewing any publicly available papers and reports on the relevant populations, including reports already prepared by Franet 9 , in order to conceptualise the overall survey design and to collect information on possible sampling frames and approaches; \u2015 identifying key organisations, experts and stakeholders with different areas of expertise to be consulted; \u2015 exploring available data that could be used for sampling (a list of sources to be consulted in each country was provided by the Central Coordination Team (CCT)) 10 ; \u2015 setting up group discussions and/or in-depth interviews in each country with experts and stakeholders; The objectives of the stakeholder consultations were: \u2015 to raise awareness and explain the purpose of the survey; \u2015 to explain the methodology to be used; \u2015 to understand if peer interviewers could be recruited to maximise response rates; \u2015 to build rapport, trust and cooperation with these experts and Roma and Traveller community representatives, and identify key players who could help with implementing the survey, as their support in the implementation of the survey was critical to its success; \u2015 to identify further experts if the previous consultations could not answer all the research questions. 1.2. METHODOLOGY AND MATERIALS FOR STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS In total, 221 experts and Roma and Traveller community representatives across all survey countries were identified and invited to participate in the 9 Franet is the Fundamental Rights Agency\u2019s multidisciplinary research network, consisting of contractors in each Member State, the United Kingdom and observer status countries who provide FRA with relevant national data upon request. 10 The CCT included the management team from the main contractor, Ipsos MORI, and three external experts supporting the project. The CCT was responsible for the management of the survey as well as the communication between FRA and local survey teams. 1. DEVELOPING THE SURVEY ",
        "13 consultation. Of those, 81 experts actively participated, face to face, by telephone or over email . Experts from a wide range of organisations were consulted, including academics and representatives from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and central and local governments. FRA and the Ipsos MORI CCT also participated in some of the consultations. It was very difficult to align the experts\u2019 schedules with the time frame available for the background research, which led to organising one-to-one consultations instead of focus group meetings more often than was originally foreseen. However, these one-to-one meetings still proved to be very useful, as specific topics, relevant to the experts consulted, could be discussed in more detail. In Sweden, recurrent meetings with community representatives were required, in order to build trust, before valuable information on the target population could be obtained and further cooperation secured. Wherever necessary, after the initial meeting or telephone consultations, the national survey experts (NSEs) 11 followed up with further written correspondence to clarify outstanding queries. For the stakeholder consultations, the following materials and protocols were prepared to ensure that all the necessary information was captured and recorded systematically and consistently across countries: \u2015 a protocol for contacting stakeholders and experts including a log for recording contact and outcomes with each stakeholder approached, and detailing: \u00cb the steps to be undertaken when making contact, \u00cb an overview of the information to be collected, \u00cb general guidelines for communication with Roma and Travellers, \u00cb data protection-related issues; \u2015 background information to be provided to the stakeholders, which included: \u00cb a letter introducing the survey and the purpose of the consultation, \u00cb a one-page overview of the questionnaire, \u00cb a consent form to store stakeholder contact details and share them with FRA, \u00cb a set of slides to be used during the consultations to provide further information about the survey; \u2015 a meeting guide providing: \u00cb a comprehensive set of questions and discussion points for the consultations, covering sampling, sampling approaches, engaging local communities, engaging respondents and questionnaire design considerations, \u00cb the objectives to be achieved from each section, and some background information, followed by the detailed discussion points; \u2015 a template for recording the notes from each consultation; 11 Each local agency was supported and led by one or two NSEs who provided input into the mapping of the target group(s) and survey approaches, and submitted the deliverables, fieldwork updates and translations of survey materials to the CCT. ",
        "14 1.3. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES IN DATA COLLECTION The preparation of the survey needed to take into account the particularities of the target population and ensure that ethical and cultural aspects and specific needs or vulnerabilities of the Roma and Travellers were addressed. To reach out to these often called \u2018hard to reach\u2019 groups, the survey tried to apply a set of principles the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has formulated to ensure the respect of human rights-based principles in data collection: 12 participation, self-identification, transparency, privacy and accountability in the design, collection and use of data in line with Agenda 2030 to leave no one behind. 13 Participation: The survey paid particular attention to the principle of participation, one of the EU\u2019s 10 common basic principles on Roma inclusion 14 , by including communities in the preparation, sampling and implementation of the survey. Moreover, the survey either recruited and trained interviewers with Roma and/or Traveller backgrounds or worked with mediators with Roma or Traveller backgrounds or strong ties to the communities involved. In France, access to halting sites was organised through municipalities and halting site managers. Self-identification: Roma and Travellers in the survey countries are hard to identify or might even be reluctant to self-identify. This might be due to experiences of historical persecution as well as mistrust in authorities or experiences of discrimination and exclusion due to ethnic, racial or religious origin. In some countries, legal restrictions prevent data collection on ethnic or racial origin (e.g. French law prohibits the collection of data based on race, ethnicity or religion). The principle of self-identification can overcome these barriers, and it should always be applied to populations with sensitive personal identity characteristics. It can also help to overcome mistrust and reluctance to participate. The target population was therefore consulted beforehand about how they would like to be identified. The concepts of privacy, transparency and data protection are inherent to the principles of statistical data collections and were applied with particular emphasis to overcome mistrust and reluctance to participate. 1.4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRA managed the survey in close cooperation with the contractor, Ipsos MORI. The CCT was responsible for the coordination and management of the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 and functioned as the link between FRA and the local survey teams. The CCT members were carefully selected based on their expertise in coordinating and designing multi-country surveys with hard-to-reach groups, particularly experience obtained through the implementation of FRA\u2019s EU- MIDIS II. To complement the team\u2019s expertise, three external experts supported the project: \u2015 Dr David Smith (University of Greenwich) as Senior Survey Expert, who was involved in the questionnaire design and implementation phase and the training of the NSEs (see below); 12 United Nations (2018), A human rights-based approach to data , Switzerland, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 13 Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 14 European Union (2010), The 10 Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion \u2013 Vademecum , Luxembourg, Publications Office. ",
        "15 \u2015 Professor Peter Lynn (University of Essex) as Senior Sampling and Weighting Expert, overseeing the sampling and weighting designs and the sampling plans for each survey group; \u2015 Gergely Hideg (international consultant \u2013 survey statistician and methodologist) as Sampling Consultant, developing the overall and country-specific sampling designs. FRA was supported by the sampling and weighting expertise of Dr Francesca Gagliardi and Professor Gianni Betti from the University of Siena in the capacity of senior consultants on sampling and weighting. They were involved in the review of the sampling and weighting scheme, the checking of the calculations, and the documentation of the sampling and weighting procedures. They also did a final quality assessment of the chosen methodology and formulated recommendations for future research. Country-based partner agencies were selected based on their continuous successful work with Ipsos MORI for other projects, and their experience with surveying Roma and Travellers or other hard-to-reach populations. These agencies were IRB Europe (BE), Efficience3 (FR), Ipsos MRBI (IE), Labyrinth (NL), Ipsos Sweden (SE) and Ipsos MORI (UK). The local teams were responsible for the data collection and overseeing fieldwork in each country. The local agencies were supported and led by NSEs: Peter Willis and Tena Lavrencic (BE), Alexandre Riffaud (FR), Kieran O\u2019Leary (IE), Nathan Rozema and Debberah ten Velthuis (NL), Hans Tjernberg and Eva Ohlsson (SE) and Kully Kaur-Ballagan (UK). FRA participated in debriefings and coordination meetings with the NSEs as needed. Local teams worked closely with community members, support organisations and other mediating persons to introduce the survey to communities and potential respondents. The community members and Roma and Traveller organisations helped to set out the sampling frames, developed and provided training, and helped to recruit interviewers and mediators from the communities or related organisations. Most importantly, their support helped to overcome mistrust and pessimism of Roma and Travellers about \u2018surveys from institutions\u2019 and encourage them to participate. Without their contribution this survey would not have been possible. It showed that active participation and partnership increase the quality of such a project. The project was commissioned in December 2017 with a view to delivering all outputs within 21 months of the contract signature date. The contract was extended for 1 month, until October 2019, to complete all the activities, because of the additional time needed to develop and adapt the sampling strategies. A quality assurance plan (QAP) was agreed with Ipsos MORI at the beginning of the project (see Annex 12.2). This outlined the procedures, indicators and targets that would be used to monitor quality at all stages of the survey life cycle, and detailed how these targets\u2019 achievement would be documented. The QAP in the annex of this report, and the relevant chapters of the report, describe the quality assurance procedures relevant to various activities, such as sampling, translations and interviewing. ",
        "16 This chapter provides an overview of the development of the questionnaire and other survey materials, the translation process and the production of the computerised version of the questionnaire for use in the field. The Survey on the Rights and Living Conditions of Roma and Travellers 2018/2019 was implemented through face-to-face interviewing with computer- assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) in all countries. The questionnaire was developed in Excel format before being scripted in Ipsos\u2019s bespoke CAPI software, iField. In addition to the CAPI questionnaires, the other materials used for the implementation of the survey were: \u2015 contact sheets for screening respondents and monitoring fieldwork (these included a PSU contact sheet to record activity at the PSU level and an electronic contact sheet (ECS), which was administered at the household level); \u2015 a training manual issued to all interviewers; \u2015 a set of briefing slides to train the NSEs and interviewers in each country; \u2015 show cards for interviewers and respondents to use during the interview; \u2015 a letter and an information postcard to help interviewers introduce the survey to potential respondents; \u2015 a short introductory video for each country/language to be used by interviewers and mediators to introduce the survey to respondents; \u2015 a privacy notice to be provided to respondents at the end of the interview in line with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The contractor worked closely with FRA on the development of all materials. Further details about the development and content of each item are provided throughout this chapter. In addition incentives were used to thank respondents or their communities for their time and participation in the survey. 2.1. QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT The questionnaire from FRA\u2019s Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS II) was used as a basis for the Roma and Travellers Survey, with a number of questions deleted and some new questions added in order to ensure that it was the appropriate length and relevant to the survey respondents as well as the stakeholders. Overall, the final questionnaire was shorter than the questionnaire fielded for EU-MIDIS II. The structure of the questionnaire 15 followed a modular approach and was divided into sections as shown in Table 1. 15 The main source questionnaire is available in FRA (2020), Roma and Travellers in Six Countries \u2013 Questionnaire , Luxembourg, Publications Office. An overview of the subchapters is presented in a flowchart in the Annex, Section 1. 2. DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSLATION OF FIELDWORK MATERIALS ",

        "18 Ipsos MORI worked closely with FRA on the development of the final questionnaire based on the draft version provided by FRA. The Senior Survey Expert 16 was consulted during the development of the questionnaire. The background research and country- / target group-specific considerations were also taken into account. The questionnaire was piloted in all countries prior to main-stage fieldwork, and a number of changes were made following this to reduce the questionnaire length, improve the flow of questions and clarify some questions. Collecting a valid response on age and gender for all respondents and household members was mandatory (i.e. no refusals or don\u2019t know responses allowed). To aid this, if a respondent did not know or preferred not to give their exact age or that of any other household members, an estimate was asked for. The response categories were provided to determine whether the respondent/household member was a child, a young person, of working age or older than working age. The age bands provided were also aligned with the quotas that were set in certain countries (see Chapter 4). A number of country-specific questions/categories were required in order to accurately capture the population group, and personal and household-related details. In the data, these are presented as single harmonised variables, but the country-specific questions and categories are also provided. The country- specific codes for each of these questions can be found in the questionnaire. Ethnicity One element of the survey that needed careful consideration was the method of screening for eligibility. Respondents needed to self-identify as being Roma, Travellers or Gypsies, using any of the locally employed terms associated with these umbrella terms. FRA and experts advised the fieldwork teams to provide a detailed list of the different ways in which Roma and Travellers might identify themselves in each country. This was important to ensure that the human rights principles concerning self-identification were taken into account, to guarantee that groups were not stereotyped in any way and that individuals neither declined to participate nor were excluded because they did not recognise themselves within the categories provided. The question on belonging to the target group was tailored to the country, based on the information collected during the background research stage (and updated following the pilot). The list of terms used in each country is provided in the questionnaire. Umbrella terms While it was important to use a detailed list of ethnicities when asking potential respondents which Roma, Traveller or Gypsy group they identified with, it would not have been practical or possible to use these narrower categories in all the survey materials or throughout the questionnaire. Given this, an umbrella term was used when referring to the survey and when asking if respondents had had certain experiences because of their Roma or Traveller ethnicity. These umbrella terms were suggested by the NSEs based on findings from the background research. Table 2 provides the survey title and umbrella term used in each county (in the national languages, and other languages used in Belgium). 16 Dr David Smith has extensive experience of quantitative and qualitative research and specific expertise related to Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. He provided insight into the questionnaire design and implementation phase, trained the NSEs and signed off the interviewer-training manual and central briefing slides. ",
        "19 Housing During the preparatory phase, different kinds of accommodation were identified for each target group and country. This was important for sampling and analysis purposes and also to filter or adapt the wording of certain questions that concern respondents\u2019 living arrangements. This was coded by the interviewer for interviews that were conducted at the respondent\u2019s home. In countries where the interviews were conducted somewhere other than the respondent\u2019s home, respondents were asked to indicate what type of accommodation they lived in from a list provided. A further question, related to the ownership of the halting sites that Caravan dwellers and Travellers lived in, was also included and tailored as appropriate, by country. Education The questions regarding the highest level of education gained within the survey country were based on the internationally comparable International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 2011 17 categories. The NSEs provided the country-specific categories for use in their respective countries along with how they would be mapped onto the harmonised code frame, which were approved by FRA prior to their use. 17 ISCED 2011 is an instrument to compile, present and compare education statistics at national and international levels. More information can be found in UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2012), International Standard Classification of Education \u2013 ISCED 2011 , Quebec, UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

        "20 Respondents who were not born in the survey country were also asked about the highest level of education completed in another country. Given that the respondents might have previously lived in a variety of countries, it was not possible to provide country-specific categories for each of these. Therefore, a generic code frame was developed to capture the highest level of education that may have been obtained outside the survey country, based on ISCED 2011. For children in the household, the survey asked if they attended any educational institution. Categories were again based on ISCED 2011, adapted to the national context. The compulsory school age varies between countries. This was also taken into account when finalising the final code frame for each country. Income The questionnaire asked the household\u2019s combined net monthly income. In case of non-response, standardised income bands were used across all countries. The original code frame was taken from the EU-MIDIS II questionnaire. The original scale was in euro. For countries that do not have euro, the exchange rate from the European Central Bank on 10 July 2018 was used to convert the income into national currencies. Some adjustments and rounding were done to make the eventual code frames more user-friendly for respondents. Equality bodies Respondents were asked about their awareness of country-specific equality bodies dealing with discrimination issues and if they had reported any experiences of discrimination to these bodies. The list of equality bodies for each country was provided by FRA. Health The translations of the three questions regarding respondents\u2019 assessment of their overall health, the Minimum European Health Module, originate from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). Names of national basic health insurance schemes were used in the questions. Poverty threshold For the question measuring if a household could afford an unexpected but necessary expense, the amount specified was set at one twelfth of the national at-risk-of-poverty threshold for a one-person household in 2016 (60 % of the yearly median income) according to Eurostat. Scripting All interviewing was conducted face to face using CAPI on interviewers\u2019 touch- screen devices (tablets). The same CAPI software was used in all countries (iField data collection platform) to field the questionnaire. The ECS (see Section 2.2.1) and questionnaire were scripted by Ipsos MORI once the Excel versions of both documents were finalised. The Excel documents contained the scripting instructions necessary for the scripters who developed the iField tool based on the Excel documents (e.g. taking note of the conditions for questions to be skipped, whether questions allow single or multiple answers, if certain text should be underlined, etc.). The ECS and the questionnaire were set up so that the relevant information collected during completion of the ECS was pulled through to the questionnaire, for example the names/initials and gender of eligible household members, to help ensure that the questions in the questionnaire could be tailored to respondents\u2019 household composition and so that the respondent would not need to be asked the same questions twice (once in the ECS for screening purposes and again in the questionnaire). The ECS and questionnaire scripts went through extensive checks. These involved: ",
        "21 \u2015 Ipsos MORI manually checking the questionnaire for accuracy and completeness; \u2015 Ipsos MORI flooding the script with dummy data and checking the data output files to ensure that all questions were being asked and that all routing was correct based on the expected base sizes for each question if the routing had been accurately implemented; \u2015 FRA checking and providing detailed feedback with suggestions for improving the overall appearance of the scripts as they appeared on the interviewers\u2019 tablets; a log of all requested corrections and changes was maintained. Once the main source script was approved it was then exported into an MR Translate file. This is an Excel file that contains the full questionnaire and any necessary code that affects the appearance of the script on the CAPI devices (for example if text should start on a new line or be a certain font colour or style). This is the version of the questionnaire that was used for translation. Once the translated/adapted versions of the ECS and questionnaire were approved, the main source script was overwritten with the country/language versions of the scripts. The translated ECS and questionnaire scripts were provided to the NSEs to check that the country/language versions of the scripts had been correctly uploaded, before again providing these to FRA for its own checks and approval. 2.2. DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER SURVEY MATERIAL 2.2.1. Electronic contact sheets Instead of recording details of interviewers\u2019 contact with the households on paper, ECSs were used, allowing easier administration and integration with the main survey interview and data. The ECS was used to manage the sample, screen households, make appointments, select the respondents for interviews (if applicable) and start the interview. The ECS was managed through the same iField application that was used for the survey questionnaire. There were essentially two versions of the ECS: one for random selection of respondents and one for non-random/quota sampling. Both versions of the contact sheet included an introduction to the survey and a self-identification question (this was asked even when respondents were pre-recruited by mediators in some instances of non-random/quota sampling). They collected information on the address or place where the interview was carried out, the number of visits to each household/respondent and the outcome of each visit. Where the outcome of the visit was a refusal, the ECS also required the interviewer to state the reason for refusal. The random selection version of the ECS was used, in the end, in France, the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti) and the United Kingdom. This version also collected information on the type of accommodation of the selected household, the number of eligible household members and (if there were any) the name/initials and age of each of the eligible household members. The application then randomly selected the respondent for the interviewer to attempt an interview with, and it was possible to select a respondent directly in the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti) and the United Kingdom 18 . For these two groups, a separate ECS could be opened to interview a second eligible household member (who was treated as living alone in order to avoid the repetition of, for example, collecting information on other household 18 Given the feasibility of random selection of respondents in France, the option of direct selection was not applied in France as in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. ",
        "22 members). The second interview was then linked to that of the first respondent by means of a household identification (ID) code generated during the first interview. 2.2.2. Sampling unit contact sheets The PSU contact sheet provided interviewers with details about the PSU (or where applicable SSU) they would be working in and helped them to keep a log of activity at the PSU (or SSU) level \u2013 for example on the type of PSU, sampling unit, and outcomes of visits to the PSU. Two types of PSU contact sheets were used: one for random sampling and one for quota sampling. The PSU contact sheet for random sampling contained information on how to complete a listing of households and to calculate the interval for selecting households from the list. The PSU contact sheet for non-random (quota) sampling provided details of pre-set quotas. Table 3 summarises the final structure of the two PSU contact sheets including the changes that were made based on the experiences from the pilot study. TABLE 3: STRUCTURE OF THE PSU CONTACT SHEETS Section PSU contact sheet random PSU contact sheet non-random/quota A PSU details: \u2022 This section included details about the PSU including the PSU ID and interviewer ID numbers; PSU name; target group; type of PSU; if there was a mediator / site manager / representative at this PSU; and if permission had been sought and received in advance for interviewers to visit the PSU\ufffd It was also to confirm whether there was a list of households already available or not PSU details: \u2022 This section included details about the PSU including the PSU ID and interviewer ID numbers; PSU name; target group; type of PSU; barriers to accessing the PSU or to fulfilling quotas; if there was a mediator / site manager / representative at this PSU; and if permission had been sought and received in advance for interviewers to visit the PSU B Household selection: \u2022 how to make a list or mark the PSU map with households (if no list could be made); \u2022 when to use random route; \u2022 how to calculate the sampling interval; \u2022 which should be the first household to select if working from a list; \u2022 when a \u2018full census\u2019 of the PSU should be conducted Total number of interviews and minimum quota: \u2022 minimum quotas for age/gender and other \u2018soft\u2019 quotas 19 ; \u2022 maximum number of interviews that could be recruited through one support organisation / mediator; \u2022 maximum number of interviews that could be achieved from a single extended familial unit (several households); \u2022 one or two respondents could be interviewed per household C Contact record: \u2022 the date and time of each visit to the PSU; \u2022 whether the interviewer spoke to a site manager/mediator/traveller or not; \u2022 if random walk was implemented; \u2022 why no random walk was implemented; \u2022 why it was not possible to contact any household; \u2022 any other information Any other information: \u2022 any useful information about the PSU not covered by earlier sections 19 Minimum quota by age and gender set up to 75 % of the sample, soft quota to less than 75 %; see Section 6.7. ",
        "23 2.2.3. Interviewer manual The interviewer-training manual was largely based on the one used for EU- MIDIS II, but was adapted and tailored by Ipsos MORI. The input of experts and Roma and Traveller representatives was also incorporated to give special recognition to the sensitivities around interviewing these target groups. The manual was used to accompany interviewer training and served as a comprehensive reference for interviewers once fieldwork had started. Country versions of the manual were tailored as necessary according to the sampling method being implemented and target group considerations. It covered the following topics: \u2015 introduction to FRA and its work; \u2015 background to and aims of the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019; \u2015 information on who are Roma and Travellers, including country-specific and group-specific background information; \u2015 ethical and cultural considerations for interviewing Roma and Travellers and conducting a survey on this subject matter; \u2015 working with mediators; \u2015 the sampling method for each country / target group, how to make contact with and select respondents; \u2015 advice on how to introduce the survey and maximise response rates; \u2015 the fieldwork materials; \u2015 administering the questionnaire and use of show cards; \u2015 quality control and interviewer feedback. Following the feedback from the pilot, summary sections were added to the manual, providing a short overview for each section to make it easier for interviewers to use in the field. In addition, in France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, some pictures of halting sites were included to help familiarise interviewers with the areas in which they would be interviewing. 2.2.4. Other survey materials Show cards, an introductory video, an introductory letter, an information postcard/leaflet, a list of support organisations and a privacy notice were also produced for use in the survey. \u2015 Show cards \u2013 sheets listing the available answer categories for a specific questions \u2013 were based on the final approved questionnaire translations and used in paper format. For some questions the codes on the show cards were presented alternately in standard (e.g. codes listed A\u2013E) and reverse order (e.g. E\u2013A) to help mitigate any order effect, that is, codes from the top or bottom of the list being selected because of their position on the show card. Each pack of show cards included only one version \u2013 either standard or reverse \u2013 and interviewers were given one or the other to use for all their interviews. Respondents only needed to state the number or letter from the show card that corresponded to the item they selected. If the respondent, owing to poor literacy, was unable to read in any of the languages offered in the country, the interviewer read out the answer options for them. The interviewer was instructed to also read out the answer options if the respondent was showing difficulties with reading without officially admitting it. \u2015 The introduction letter to be handed out to all respondents was drafted and translated into all survey languages used. It provided a brief overview of the objectives, context and administration of the survey and provided a contact in the national fieldwork agency to whom the respondent could turn with further questions. If the respondent was unable to read in any of the languages owing to poor literacy, the interviewer read out the letter for them. ",
        "24 \u2015 The introductory video 20 was prepared by FRA, translated into the relevant national languages 21 and provided on the CAPI devices for interviewers to show to respondents when first making contact. It briefly described the purpose of the study, the methodology and how the results would be used. It was provided in the relevant national languages for each country. Based on a mediator\u2019s advice, a second video by the NSE was produced for use in Belgium to try to encourage Roma living in the Wallonia Region, specifically, to participate. In agreement with FRA, this video was also distributed via selected social media channels. \u2015 The postcard/leaflet provided a visually appealing informative document, containing the most important information from the introduction letter and the privacy notice in a concise format. The postcard was used by both interviewers and mediators to inform people about the survey. \u2015 The privacy notice was designed in line with national implementation of the GDPR. It contained more information about the survey, how respondents\u2019 data would be used and their rights to amend or delete it. It also provided details on whom respondents could contact should they have an enquiry or a complaint. \u2015 Interviewers were also provided with a list of support organisations in the relevant survey country. This was handed out to respondents at the end of the interview, unless interviewers felt it to be more appropriate earlier on during the interview, for example if the respondent requested such a list, or if they had emotional reactions, triggered by remembering upsetting or frustrating events while answering the questions. 2.3. INCENTIVES I ncentives in the form of low-value gift vouchers and cash, conditional on completion of the survey, were offered in all countries but Ireland and the Netherlands as a way of thanking the respondents for their time. No incentives were handed out to the respondents in Ireland and the Netherlands, as it was agreed with the community organisations that the incentives would go directly to the entire community. 2.4. TRANSLATION 2.4.1. Overview All interviewer- and respondent-facing materials were translated into the relevant national languages 22 for use in each country, other than Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the main source version (English) was used as the basis for national tailoring of the materials. Following the background research, FRA, the CCT and the NSEs reviewed which non-national languages would be required in each country. Additional languages were deemed necessary only in Belgium, where all of the respondent-facing survey materials were provided in Bulgarian, Romanian and Slovak as well as French and Dutch. In the other countries, either the groups that would speak the non-national languages were dropped from the survey design (e.g. immigrant Roma in France) or it was felt that too few respondents would participate to warrant country-specific non-national language versions to be produced. Romani, 20 The experience of NSEs suggested the explanatory video in addition to the introductory letter could help to gain the trust of target populations, and could also address the potential problems with literacy. 21 In Belgium, versions with subtitles in Bulgarian, Romanian and Slovak were also provided. 22 Dutch (separate versions for Belgium and the Netherlands), French (separate versions for Belgium and France), Swedish. ",
        "25 the common language of Roma, has a lot of variations depending on country of origin, and its codification is not standardised yet. Therefore, it was not feasible to produce the survey materials in Romani. The CCT worked with the linguistic quality control agency cApStAn for the translation component. Located in Brussels, cApStAn specialises in the translation and verification of research instruments for high-quality cross- national/cross-cultural surveys. cApStAn had already worked on the EU-MIDIS II project and was therefore familiar with the questionnaire. Each team of translators, appointed by cApStAn and the national survey agencies, consisted of two linguists, who each produced an original translation of new questions in the source questionnaire (translation 1 and translation 2), and an adjudicator responsible for the merging and adjudication of the two translations. 2.4.2. Questionnaire translation and adaption steps Step 1 \u2013 briefing All translators and adjudicators were required to attend a briefing session, held as a webinar, led by Ipsos MORI and cApStAn. Participants were briefed on the survey\u2019s background, purpose and intended use; the meaning of any complex terms or concepts were explained; the translation environment was presented; and Ipsos MORI and cApStAn prepared hands-on exercises. There was also time for questions from translators. Sessions were held separately depending on the role of each participant (translator or adjudicator) with clear instructions on what was expected at each stage. This briefing was supported by written notes in the form of an annotated questionnaire, to which the translators could refer. In addition, a bilingual glossary and a set of item-by-item translation and adaptation notes was provided. The glossary explained key terms used in the survey instruments. Channels of communication were kept open throughout the translation process so that if the translator had a question concerning a term or phrase in the source text they could ask for clarification. Step 2 \u2013 translation Where translations already existed from EU-MIDIS II, these were kept but nevertheless reviewed by the translators. Furthermore, for questions that feature in EU-SILC the translations available from that were used. New or adapted questions that did not appear in either of the aforementioned surveys were translated. The English main source questionnaire was also reviewed and adapted to ensure that the terminology was appropriate and local differences were accommodated. The adapted translation, review, adjudication, pretesting and documentation (TRAPD) approach was used for translation of the new and adapted parts of the questionnaire. For around 50 % of new content, two independent professional translations were produced in parallel by different translators (translator 1 and translator 2) which were then merged (reconciled) by an adjudicator. For the national languages, translator 1 and the adjudicator were appointed by cApStAn while translator 2 was appointed by the local fieldwork agency. For Bulgarian, Romanian and Slovak, the whole team was appointed by cApStAn. The translated questionnaires were provided to FRA for approval. The other 50 % of the new content was identified as less sensitive or very straightforward to translate and thus marked for single translation; such parts nevertheless were reviewed by the adjudicator to ensure overall consistency. ",
        "26 For languages that are shared by two or more countries (e.g. French for Belgium and France), typically a first version would be prepared and then adapted in the review and adjudication stage. Given the high percentage of already localised/adapted content to be recovered from EU-MIDIS II and EU-SILC, it was decided to skip the adaptation step and directly produce a national version for each country. A simplified translation approach was adopted for the other survey materials 23 : single translation and proofreading by two separate linguists, before providing the translation to FRA for final approval. The NSE in each country was responsible for overseeing the translation and independent proofreading of the survey materials in the national language(s) of each country, while Ipsos MORI appointed cApStAn to translate and proofread the materials in the non-national languages. Step 3 \u2013 review and adjudication For each language version, an adjudicator was appointed. The adjudicators all belonged to cApStAn\u2019s network of experienced verifiers of data collection instruments and were familiar with state-of-the-art linguistic quality assurance documentation practices. All had one or more higher education qualifications, and all were native speakers of the target language and highly proficient in English. They were all accustomed to explaining the rationale behind their choices in English and to adjudicating in accordance with the \u2018ask the same question\u2019 approach, whereby the final version must be fit for purpose, linguistically correct and equivalent to the source. As explained under \u2018Step 1 \u2013 briefing\u2019 above, adjudicators joined a web-based training session provided by cApStAn. This helped them to familiarise with the survey and the monitoring tool. The adjudicators were instructed to: \u2015 carefully read the source document, the translation notes and the adaptation notes; \u2015 read through the translations proposed by translator 1 and translator 2 and consult their comments; \u2015 provide a reconciled version, in which consistency in terminology and repeated elements needed to be guaranteed, taking the best elements from each translation; \u2015 report any doubts, challenges in making choices or adaptation issues in their comments column; \u2015 highlight the issues to discuss during the team review meeting. No segments were marked for discussion by the adjudicator in any language version. The adjudicated version was shared with the translators, who had the opportunity to challenge it and mark segments for discussion. The translators agreed with the adjudicated version for all languages. No team review meetings were held. Step 4 \u2013 proofreading The adjudicated version was proofread to ensure that no typographical errors, errors related to punctuation or grammar, accidentally omitted items and the like were present. The proofreader did not consult the source version as far as content was concerned, except for a \u2018completeness check\u2019 of the target version. Step 5 \u2013 preparation of the final version The proofread and quality-checked version was sent to the local agencies to do a final check on translations in terms of suitability for the target groups 23 Show cards, PSU contact sheet, interviewer manual, introduction letter, postcard, privacy notice.

        "27 and for preparation of the final online implementation version with all local tailoring. This version was provided to FRA for final comment/approval before overwriting the main source script. 2.4.3. Tools and instruments used for the translation of the questionnaire All translations were performed in OmegaT, a translation program for professional translators to assure the security and confidentiality of each translation. Each linguist received personalised access to the translation project (hosted on a cApStAn server) and processed it in OmegaT. The item-by-item guidelines and the key terms were available in OmegaT for the linguists to consult and apply in the translation. The linguists benefited from the bilingual glossaries and used an active translation memory in the tool. All the translations and documentation were recorded in a centralised monitoring tool in Excel format, prepared by cApStAn and referred to as the translation, adaptation and adjudication follow-up form (TAAF). This tool contained the source version of the questionnaire as exported from the scripted main source version (this allowed efficient overwriting of the main source script with the translated versions once they were approved). It also contained the agreed item-specific translation and adaptation notes. The TAAF contained separate columns for each contributor: translator 1, translator 2, adjudicator, proofreader, Ipsos MORI and FRA. It also included details on where translations of the new/changed questions differed or not and the outcome of the review process plus any details on suggested amendments to existing questions. The names of the adjudicators and the NSE or project manager signing off each translated version were provided in the file. ",
        "28 This chapter provides an overview of the field force and its training in each country, and a summary of the mediators with whom each local agency worked throughout the implementation of the main-stage fieldwork. Interviewers were responsible for conducting the interviews in all countries. The mediators assisted with the recruitment of respondents in all countries. Details of the country-specific arrangements are described in each section of this chapter. 3.1. CENTRAL PROJECT BRIEFING Three NSE briefing sessions were held prior to any interviewer training and followed a \u2018train the trainer\u2019 approach (Table 4). The NSEs were briefed on their responsibilities during the fieldwork period and how they should communicate specific components of the fieldwork and interview process to the interviewers. The NSEs\u2019 briefings also provided an opportunity for FRA, the CCT and the local agencies to meet and discuss sampling and survey approaches in the main-stage fieldwork and experiences from the pilot.

INTERVIEWER SELECTION AND TRAINING ",
        "29 It had originally been intended that the project teams from all six countries would attend the same central briefing. As the preparations for the fieldwork in the Netherlands and in Sweden were ahead of other countries and the plan was to start the fieldwork in these countries first, briefings for these two agencies were held separately ahead of the others. The briefings covered the following topics: an introduction to the survey and its background; historical and cultural information on Roma and Traveller subgroups in the participating countries; sampling and contacting the respondents; ethical and cultural considerations; interviewers\u2019 behaviour during fieldwork; strategies to maximise response rates; the questionnaire; and the responsibilities of the local teams/NSEs. 3.2. INTERVIEWER SELECTION Given the complexity of the survey, it was preferred that all interviewers working on it had experience of interviewing respondents on sensitive topics and (where relevant) of working on random probability surveys. In addition, interviewers (and those from the community where possible) were also required to have at least 3 months\u2019 active interviewing experience, experience in conducting interviews using CAPI, fluency in the national language(s) of the survey country and, if possible, experience of interviewing Roma and Travellers. In Belgium fluency in the language of the target population (Bulgarian, Romanian or Slovak in addition to Dutch or French) was also required of selected interviewers. The possibility of working with interviewers who were from the Roma or Traveller communities (also referred to as community interviewers in this report) was also discussed with FRA and with the NSEs. It was thought that working with Roma or Traveller interviewers would help with engaging the relevant communities, and in the Netherlands it was considered essential. The main issue with working with community interviewers was that there are generally not enough of them who are already trained and working as professional interviewers. Thus, they did not have the requisite experience or would have to undergo more extensive training and supervision before they could be employed. For the main-stage fieldwork, community interviewers were employed in four of the six countries 24 . Table 5 provides an overview of the number of interviewers who were briefed on the survey, the number who eventually conducted at least one interview and some basic profile information on the ages and backgrounds of the interviewers (where available). 24 The local agencies in France and Sweden opted not to engage community interviewers but still used the mediators for getting access to target populations.

",
        "31 3.3 WORKING WITH MEDIATORS One of the outcomes of the background research and the discussions between FRA, the CCT and the local agencies was that the use of mediators could help ensure access to some of the Roma and Traveller communities and advance the fieldwork in other ways. Mediators could be members or representatives of the Roma and Traveller communities or persons who worked closely with the communities, such as social workers. As part of the survey fieldwork, mediators were used in all countries and with all target groups, except in France with Travellers (Gens du voyage). Halting site managers were contacted there to facilitate access. Contact with mediators was established during the first phases of the project (background research and stakeholder consultations, pilot phase). The role of the mediators varied a little between countries, but in general they were responsible for promoting the survey within the relevant communities, recruiting respondents in the case of non-random selection and accompanying interviewers in the field. They played a key role during the main-stage fieldwork. Mediators received remuneration from the local agencies for their services (usually as a part-time engagement alongside their main job). Because they were important interlocutors with the target communities, FRA also engaged with them during the follow-up activities. They were also given a privacy notice detailing how their personal data would be securely handled. Despite the benefits that mediators brought to the survey, each country also identified some challenges. In all countries, this included the time it took to engage mediators, and delays in responding, which often led to substantial fieldwork delays. Feedback from each of the countries is provided in Table 6. ",

It forms a framework within which local tasks are carried out together. It is the least integrated form of intercommunality. In all countries, mediators were provided with the fieldwork introduction materials (introduction letter, postcard, one-page presentation of the questionnaire) and were shown the video prepared by FRA. In the Netherlands, where the mediators played an important role in the fieldwork coordination, they were provided with the interviewer-training manual, while in Ireland and in the United Kingdom they received a summary version of the document. ",
        "33 3.4 INTERVIEWER TRAINING All interviewers had to attend two days of training before conducting any interviews. On the first day, the project background, objectives, practising the use of the questionnaire, etc. were covered and then, after completing the first interviews, the interviewers attended a second day to go through their experiences and receive further training as necessary. The training sessions were organised and conducted by the NSE(s) of each country. The structure of the sessions followed the agenda of the central project briefing, with special focus on cultural and ethical considerations, behaviour when interacting with respondents (for non-community interviewers), the questionnaire and how to use the CAPI software. As was encouraged after the pilot, mediators, experts and support organisations were present at the training in some countries and provided insights and advice on conducting fieldwork that were more local and specific to the community. A FRA representative participated in at least one training session in each of the survey countries and, upon request, provided clarifications directly to the local teams as necessary regarding the fieldwork implementation and the rationale of the survey questions. FRA also provided feedback to the CCT if no CCT member participated in the training session. The number of training sessions varied between the survey countries (Table 7), reflecting the size of the country, the possibility of finding a commonly suitable date and the number of participating interviewers, as well as the need to flexibly react to fieldwork development.

        "34 This chapter provides an overview of the sample design for each country. The sampling was developed based on extensive background research, as in none of the countries was a sampling frame available. The choice of the actual sampling and survey design depended on the availability of information about where the Roma and Travellers live and the feasibility of implementing the survey for a specific group. As a first step, the NSEs identified the different Roma and Traveller target groups in each country, estimated the population size and assessed if groups should be distinguished in terms of sampling and how a group could be accessed. The experiences from the pilot survey contributed to the final decision regarding the target group and sampling design in each country. 4.1. TARGET POPULATION AND SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS The survey targeted members of the population who: \u2015 self-identified as being Roma or Travellers or belonging to one of the subgroups in the survey country; \u2015 were aged 16 years or older and had been living in private households within the survey country, irrespective of language, nationality or legal residence status; \u2015 were resident in the survey country for a total of at least 6 months 27 of the 12 months prior to the interview; The groups surveyed in each country during the pilot and the main survey are listed in Table 8. 27 This decision was taken in order to accommodate the non-sedentary lifestyle of the target groups, e.g. in cases of cross-country travel by Caravan dwellers. 4.

However, interviewers were instructed not to exclude respondents if they identified with any other group not explicitly targeted through the sampling frame. B Referred to as Gypsies and Travellers in this report. C Only halting sites in England and Wales are covered. D The General Pardon group of Roma (GP Roma, also often referred to as the 1970s Roma or 1960s/1970s Roma) who arrived in the Netherlands during the 1960s and 1970s without passports or any other official documents. In 1978, the Dutch government offered the \u2018generaal pardon\u2019 (i.e. general pardon, also called amnesty) to this growing group of Roma. At the time they were about 550 families. Not all Roma have been able to make use of the general pardon, therefore, some of the members of this group are now stateless. ",
        "36 The pilot fieldwork (see Chapter 5) encountered difficulties with applying the standard definition of \u2018private household\u2019 28 to the target groups, especially those living in caravans/mobile homes. To overcome those problems, the definition was extended and the interviewers were provided with a variety of examples. The same definition was used for all the countries and target groups: \u2015 A household included either one person living alone or a group of people, not necessarily related but who knew each other, living at the same address/in one or several caravans with common housekeeping, i.e. sharing at least one meal per day or sharing a living or sitting room. It had to be the individuals\u2019 main place of residence, excluding holiday homes. \u2015 A household included children, newborns, older persons, and persons who were temporarily absent (maximum three months) for work, education or health reasons. Temporary household members (e.g. visiting family members, friends) were included if they had lived in that household for at least six months or intended to stay six months or longer. A private household excluded business addresses, and collective and institutional accommodations such as student homes, residential homes, workers\u2019 hostels and shelters for homeless persons. It could also occur that several distinct households and caravans would share one pitch and it might be difficult to establish the household setting. 4.2. SAMPLING METHODOLOGIES, SAMPLE ALLOCATION AND COVERAGE 4.2.1. General sampling methodology approaches The general approach was multistage area-based sampling. Sampling units in the first stage (PSUs) for each group covered by the survey were selected randomly or all of them were used. A single-stage approach was used when the required information (the number of occupant target group members per unit, and the contact and access details of the sites) was already available at PSU level across the areas to be covered by the survey. This was applied in the case of Ireland, for Caravan dwellers and Roma in Belgium, in Sweden, and for Roma in the Netherlands, mostly because household screening was not necessary, as quota sampling was used for household selection. The local agency still needed to consult various sources in order to obtain details of specific locations where the target population live, and their population estimates. For the populations that do not live in high concentrations (Roma in Belgium, Roma in the Netherlands, and Roma and Travellers in Sweden), it was only possible to identify municipalities where the target population resides and obtain rough estimates of their population numbers. The estimates relied on various publications and on the opinions of experts and organisations consulted. A two-stage approach was taken when the concentration levels of the target group members at primary level (municipalities or regions) were too low to use directly for random selection of households. After a random selection among PSUs, information on smaller units (locations and estimated population sizes) was gathered from knowledgeable persons and organisations within the 28 A \u2018private household\u2019 usually means \u201ca person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living.\u201d Eurostat (2017), \u2018 Glossary: Household - social statistics \u2019. ",
        "37 selected PSUs (mapping). Then a random selection of SSUs was undertaken. This was the case in France and the United Kingdom, and for Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands. The procedure for the random selection of PSUs in the single-stage approach was the same as in the second stage of SSU selection, and involved two steps. 1. Small SSUs/PSUs were grouped into larger units based on geographical proximity prior to selection. PSUs/SSUs are small if the number of interviews expected to be obtained in the PSU/SSU based on the response rate and size of the PSU/SSU is below the target number set per SSU/PSU (on average, 10 interviews). 2. The number of SSUs/PSUs to be selected was determined based on the required sample size and the average number of interviews to be conducted per SSU/PSUs (set as 10). This allowed a probability proportional to size selection, and stratification by agreed variables (see Table 11). Larger SSUs/PSUs were selected multiple times, meaning that a larger number of interviews was allocated to them at the next stage to deliver an equal probability sample (e.g. if selected twice, then 20 interviews were allocated). Two approaches were then developed for the selection of households and individuals within the selected sampling units. A random probability approach was used where the Roma and Traveller population lives in higher concentrations or in more disparate areas than can be indicated in a sample frame. The non-random quota approach was applied where a detailed sampling frame that would make a random selection feasible (by random walk, from lists, etc.) could not be established because the information was not available or because the Roma and Travellers do not live in selected concentrated areas. 4.2.2. Sample sizes, allocation, selection of sampling units and coverage Various sources were used for the estimation of the total population sizes for each group. In order to establish sample frames, the background research (see Chapter 2) in each country included extensive mapping of available data sources that could enable the creation of sample frames for each target group. Various experts were also consulted in order to evaluate the quality of the available data or provide estimates if no other data were available. The initial estimation of the total population, the data sources used and the sample frame population, with the corresponding data sources used for the estimation, are listed in Table 9. ",

        "39 The following factors influenced the decision on the sample size allocation (target sample size) across the groups: \u2015 overall estimated population size, \u2015 envisaged minimum sample size per country / target group (400 per country and 200 per target group), \u2015 feasibility of achieving the minimum sample size, \u2015 sampling approaches planned for a group, \u2015 budget available. Taking all factors into account resulted in target sample sizes per country and group that in some cases were significantly larger than the minimum sample sizes set per country. The minimum sample size requirement per country was fulfilled for each country. The minimum size of 200 for a group was neither planned nor reached for Caravan dwellers in Belgium, owing to its small population size, and the findings from the pilot survey (see Chapter 5) on the success rate. Interviewers had significant difficulties achieving the number of planned interviews. Table 10 provides the target sample sizes, as well as the coverage with regard to the originally estimated population size and the population size included in the sample frame. It also gives an overview of the numbers of PSUs and SSUs for each target group. In Belgium , a total of 115 Caravan dweller sites or groups of sites (PSUs) were identified. Owing to the small population size, an attempt was made to approach all sites in the sample frame, reaching a coverage of 100 %. However, as a result of inability to obtain final access, ineligible populations, refusal by the site population or closure of the site, cooperation could only be established with 24 sites. The initial population size was estimated as 2 300 persons in the Flemish Region and Brussels (unknown for the Wallonia Region). The sample frame provided slightly different numbers. Moreover, during fieldwork some estimates were corrected, and additional sites were discovered and added to the sample frame list. Hence, the final population number in the sample frame is higher. The total population size for Roma in Belgium was estimated as 30 000 persons based on the experts consulted during and after the background research. The sample frame estimations of 28 400 persons was derived from estimations at municipality level. The five cities of Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, Charleroi and Sint-Niklaas were included, covering an estimated 95 % of the total Roma population of Belgium. Where the remaining 5 % live is unknown, so they were excluded from the sample frame. As was found during the pilot stage, sampling temporary sites could potentially provide higher coverage than the sample frame figures suggested, given the limited duration of stay of a maximum of several weeks, limited numbers of visits per year and therefore a high turnover. Multiple visits by the interviewers with three to four week breaks in between, would guarantee coverage of different families and could potentially also include Travellers from the Wallonia Region 29 . Of the target population in the Flemish Region and Brussels, 30 % was expected to go through temporary sites during the fieldwork period. Hence, the sample design targeted 30 % of interviews to come from the temporary sites in this region. In France the sampling approach changed in the course of the preparatory and pilot phases from partly non-random selection to full random selection. 29 Legal sites allow Caravan dwellers only outside the winter months. ",
        "40 Since this comes with higher costs but also higher quality, the target sample size was reduced (from 1 600 to 1 500). After the selection of the PSUs (departments, 62 out of 96, covering 94 % of the Traveller population), it turned out that the data at municipality level provided by the Sch\u00e9ma d\u00e9partemental d\u2019accueil 30 was outdated and the local team had to complete an extensive and time-intensive mapping of halting sites in the selected PSUs including the updated sizes. All existing sites were mapped, so no losses in coverage due to the mapping were assumed. However, this resulted in a substantially lower number of Travellers (around 60 000) than assumed based on the data of the Sch\u00e9ma d\u00e9partemental d\u2019accueil (around 190 000, used for the sampling frame) and originally estimated (250 000\u2013300 000, estimate obtained during the background research). Following the mapping, the local team combined the small sites in order to create 420 SSUs of suitable size. Sites with fewer than 20 standing places, according to the sample frame information, that did not have neighbouring sites with which they could be grouped were dropped, which caused a coverage loss of 1 %. Mapping the population who lived outside halting sites and on private land locations proved to be less successful, so it was not possible to cover this population. In Ireland, the All Ireland Traveller Health Study was used for the initial estimation of the population size of 40 000, because of suspected undercoverage of Travellers in the 2016 Census. This undercoverage was taken into account and combined with data from the Traveller Count at local authority level identifying 41 345 persons. Using the electoral divisions, 291 PSUs were identified. PSUs with fewer than 100 Travellers in close proximity to each other were combined in order to maximise the coverage. The units created in this way resulted in excluding only 7 % of the target population. In the Netherlands, the background research obtained initial estimates of 13 000 Roma. For the sample frame, new estimations based on Roma Foundation Utrecht (RFU) data at municipality level were undertaken and reached 16 700 persons. All municipalities with a small number of Roma (fewer than 100) were excluded from the selection, with 222 PSUs remaining. It was estimated that this corresponds to a loss of 3 % of the coverage. Regarding the Traveller population in the Netherlands, the various sources and literature consulted during the background research indicated a population of 30 000. For the sample frame, only Travellers living in halting sites were considered and the estimates dropped to 9 600 based on Centre of Big Data Statistics data from 2018 and Association for Sinti, Roma and Travellers Netherlands (Vereniging Sinti, Roma, woonwagenbewoners in Nederland, VSRWN) estimates about Traveller houses. All municipalities with fewer than 40 Traveller houses were excluded from the sample frame, as they were considered to be too small to provide the 10 interviews required in each municipality. This resulted in an estimated reduction of 26 % of coverage among the Travellers. Furthermore, Traveller sites with fewer than 11 standing places that did not have neighbouring sites with which they could be grouped were excluded from the coverage. This caused another 3 % of coverage loss. The overall coverage of both sampling stages is 72 %. In total, 146 SSUs (halting sites) were selected within the PSUs selected in the first stage of sampling. In the Netherlands, the split of the target number of interviews between Roma (200) and Travellers and Sinti (500) was in part based on the estimates of population size that could be obtained at the time of deciding the allocation and in part based on what was considered feasible by the local fieldwork team and the supporting Roma organisation. The eventual sample frame population sizes were different from the estimates, and after the coverage losses they were actually very similar for the two groups, but 30 Direction D\u00e9partementale des Territoires (n.d.), \u2018 Sch\u00e9ma d\u00e9partemental d\u2019accueil pour les gens du voyage \u2019. ",
        "41 it would still not have been possible to increase the number of interviews completed with Roma. The originally estimated 50 000 Roma and Travellers (based on the 2010 report from the Delegation for Roma Issues) in Sweden live mostly dispersed, and there are no particular areas with higher concentrations. The sample frame population was estimated to be at 43 050 in the Franet report and Eurocities report 31 estimates at municipality level. The following cities were initially included: Stockholm, Malm\u00f6, Gothenburg, Helsingborg, Link\u00f6ping and Bor\u00e5s. Lund, a municipality close to Malm\u00f6, was included within Malm\u00f6. Similarly, Haninge is a part of greater Stockholm and was included within the Stockholm PSU. During the fieldwork implementation stage, the local team established a good relationship with the community in Uppsala, and eventually covered it by fieldwork. This resulted in an increase of coverage to 99 %. In United Kingdom, the 2011 Census estimated that the population size was around 63 000, which was discovered during the background research to be a significant underestimation of at least 50 %. Following the advice of the experts consulted, the total population was estimated to be 120 000. The governmental count of Gypsy and Traveller caravans was used for the sampling frame, and the local authorities were considered PSUs and provided a sample frame population size of 24 633. In a first step, all local authorities with fewer than 50 caravans were excluded from the coverage (16 % of the caravan-dwelling population). Consequently, the local fieldwork teams identified the caravan sites within each local authority and discovered that the number of pitches identified on sites represented only 64 % of the number of pitches reported by the local authorities. Smaller neighbouring sites were combined. Small caravan sites that did not have neighbouring sites were still included in the selection. Mapping the population who live outside caravan sites was not successful, so it was not be possible to cover this population. This partly explains the difference between the initial population estimates and the sample frame figures. However, the sample frame numbers are still lower than suggested by the original estimates of the proportion of the population outside caravan sites. 31 Eurocities (2017), Roma Inclusion in Cities.

Stratification At the first stage of the selection, stratification was applied if feasible: Table 11 provides a summary of the stratification variables used when selecting sampling units for each of the target populations, and an indication of whether the stratification was implicit or explicit. Explicit stratification assumes explicitly the number of sampling units (PSUs) to be selected in each stratum. Implicit stratification sorts the sample frame by strata and selects PSUs systematically with probability proportional to size (PPS), i.e. larger PSUs have a greater probability of being sampled. ",

Selection of households and respondents within sampling units Households and respondents were selected either with random probability or with quota sampling within the selected sampling units (PSUs/SSUs). Table 12 summarises the sampling approaches and reflects the revisions made following the pilot survey and the first stages of the main fieldwork period 32 . 32 The sampling approach was changed for France (removing the option to change to quota sampling) and the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti \u2013 option for non- random selection of respondents in case of refusal was added). ",
        "44 Random selection of households and respondents within PSU/SSU The selection of \u2018households\u2019 was defined according to the information available centrally at each site (families, accommodation units, etc.). If it was not feasible to make a random selection from lists because of unclear size of site, refusal or non-availability of this information, random walk was used instead. In smaller SSUs/PSUs this involved taking a census of all available households, in case the calculated random walk interval was less than 2. Secondly, sufficient household units were selected to deliver the required number of interviews, factoring in the expected response rates. The response rates that could be achieved were highly uncertain, so only rough estimates could be used for deciding on the number of addresses to issue per PSU/SSU in the first phase of the fieldwork. This could result in more households than originally foreseen in an SSU, and the unequal probabilities of household selection had to be corrected during the weighting process. Within households, random selection was a particular challenge. To facilitate fieldwork, it was possible to select two respondents per household among the Travellers in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom (16 % and 15 %, respectively, of the respondents are second respondents). In addition, in cases of hard refusals the non-random selection of persons was allowed; this was used in 8 % of the interviews in the Netherlands and 21 % in the United Kingdom. A minimum of two visits per site and per household (in total four minimum), if possible on different days of the week and at different times, needed to be made before the outcome could be classified as non-contact. The selected addresses were released for fieldwork in a staggered approach in order to evaluate and potentially modify the approaches if necessary. The majority of municipalities in France had only one halting site, which was often very small. These sites had to be grouped with neighbouring municipalities into SSUs often covering larger geographical areas. This created difficulties in linking a specific household to the degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) classification and to a municipality, and information concerning the DEGURBA had to be added later manually through GPS data coding. Moreover, the sample frame information at PSU level was not always accurate, as the number of Travellers identified in the selected departments differed significantly from the population figures reported in the Sch\u00e9ma d\u00e9partemental d\u2019accueil des Gens du voyage. Hence, the results of the mapping of halting sites, conducted by the local agency, had to be used for reallocating the sample.

",
        "45 Unless an alternative reliable data source on the department level becomes available, a recommendation for any future surveys with Travellers (Gens du voyage) in France is to conduct mapping of all halting sites in the country before sample selection, in order to avoid unequal selection probability and to be able to plan fieldwork more systematically. The selection within the site was done with the help of maps, if available, or through random walk. Among the Netherlands Travellers, all halting sites were identified using Google maps, and on a first visit to the site an enumeration of all caravans was made before selecting the households. In the United Kingdom, random walk was used in case household selection was necessary within the halting sites. Non-probability quota sampling approach within primary sampling unit Within each randomly selected sampling unit, the respondents were purposively selected, using a quota sampling approach. This method assumed a convenience sample reaching out to members of the target group and inviting them to the survey by any means possible 33 , including chain referral, recruitment through organisations or persons that interact with the target group, or any other method that ensures access to members of the target groups. However, the sample was constrained by quotas based on individual characteristics (such as age by gender, Roma/Traveller group, type of housing) and geographical distribution to ensure heterogeneity and prevent apparent sample biases. It was also assumed that controlling for biases in the quota variables would also control for potential biases on survey variables, via their correlations with the quota variables. The regional (or municipality) targets were set based on the sample frames covering 100 % of the sample. Only in Ireland at the first stage was a random sample with PPS drawn, being representative of the country. The minimum quota on gender/age and a soft quota were based on the (estimated) composition of the target population and on the number of interviews expected for the sampling unit. In order to provide some tolerance \u2013 given the lack of data about the actual distribution in the population \u2013 quotas on age by gender were set as minimum targets, adding up to 75 % of the total sample size. Other quota criteria, such as type of housing and Roma groups, were set as \u2018soft\u2019 quotas, owing to the lack of knowledge on the population proportions of the quota parameters. The actual distribution of the quota can be found in Section 6.7. Information on age and gender was collected for all household members of each respondent. The data were then used for evaluating the population structure in general and for weighting, when it was necessary to correct the demographic profile of the achieved sample. In addition to these quotas for individual\u2019s characteristics, the subgroups of Roma in the Netherlands, and Roma and Travellers in Sweden, the accommodation types in Ireland were set as \u2018soft\u2019 quotas to promote further heterogeneity and balancing of the sample (Table 13). 33 Some constraints still applied: the maximum number of targets a single entry point could provide, the maximum number of interviews that could be achieved from a single extended familial unit, only one respondent to be interviewed per household, direct family members of a respondent not to be recruited by the mediators, etc. ",
        "46 Beyond the control provided by the quotas, respondents were recruited purposively by mediators or interviewers using any means available to them. Given that in the instance of the Roma and Travellers Survey the quotas were imprecise, for lack of available data on target group characteristics, this approach contained a higher risk in terms of sample quality. Therefore, the following further constraints were placed on the sample recruitment process to ensure heterogeneity and increase variance. \u2015 A large number of support organisations, persons or interviewing venues (\u2018entry points\u2019) were involved in recruiting respondents. A maximum was set for the number of respondents a single-entry point could provide. However, this rule needed to be flexible, and allowed for particular circumstances when only a few support organisations existed in an area, and most of the respondents needed to be recruited by them. \u2015 A maximum of three interviews could be achieved from a single extended familial unit, except for Caravan dwellers in Belgium, where, given their small population size, the maximum was set as five. \u2015 Only one person was interviewed per household. \u2015 Direct family members of a respondent (father, mother, children, sister and brother) could not be recruited by the mediators (where this information was known to them). \u2015 If a household was approached for an interview and there were two or more people who fulfilled a specific quota (e.g. women aged 16\u201329) then the one whose first name began with the earliest letter in the alphabet was asked to participate. Efforts were made for this person to be included (e.g. if not immediately available, then interviewers tried to arrange for interview at another time). This was introduced to avoid including only the most easy-to-reach persons in the sample. \u2015 Within age groups it was aimed to achieve a variety of ages, and this was checked throughout the fieldwork. \u2015 Interviewers were available to conduct interviews in the evenings and at the weekend to ensure that persons in employment or those not available during daytime hours were included in the sample. \u2015 Because of protection of personal data, referral contacts could not be provided directly to the interviewer by the respondent or mediator. The mediator or respondent had to establish the initial contact and ask for consent to share the contact details.

Pilot fieldwork took place between August and October 2018 in all six countries where the survey was conducted. The aim of the exercise was to test the survey approach (sampling methods, target groups, collaboration with mediators) as well as the questionnaire and survey tools (introduction letter, postcard, video and show cards) in order to identify the amendments needed prior to launching the main-stage survey. Table 14 provides an overview of the number of interviews conducted in each country by target group, along with information about the location in each country.

PILOTING ",
        "48 All pilot interviewers by the NSEs were briefed in advance of the pilot fieldwork. Interviewers were required to provide detailed feedback on the pilot interviews using a standardised template. The NSEs summarised the feedback in individual country reports (again using an agreed template to ensure that each country considered all relevant aspects of the pilot in its feedback). The individual country reports contributed to the overall pilot report prepared by the CCT. The key recommendations from the pilot are reflected in the corresponding chapters of this report. The main outcome from the pilot was that more time should be taken to facilitate the collaboration of mediators and interviewers and to access sites or find respondents. It became clear that local agencies would need to work flexibly and adapt to the mediators\u2019 and respondents\u2019 schedules. Various challenges were encountered during the pilot exercise \u2013 particularly in Belgium, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom \u2013 which led to extending the overall fieldwork duration to over six weeks (rather than two weeks as originally foreseen). Still, the pilot fell short of the target number of 10 interviews in France, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Some of the main challenges encountered were related to reaching certain target groups, communicating with mediators (lack of availability of mediators during August, meetings being cancelled or rescheduled in order to follow mediators\u2019 schedules, or mediators withdrawing support), reaching and cooperating with association/organisations (owing to a lack of resources), and cancellations by and suspicion on the part of respondents.

        "49 This chapter provides an overview of the main-stage fieldwork, detailing the fieldwork progress, procedures, size and composition of the final samples achieved, and other outcomes. Owing to the challenges involved in surveying a hard-to-reach, partly mobile population without comprehensive sample frames, the assumptions made concerning the achievable sample size had to be revised several times during the project, as described in this chapter. 6.1. FIELDWORK DATES AND PROGRESS The fieldwork started in December 2018 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In France fieldwork started in February 2019, and in Ireland in March 2019. The fieldwork was originally scheduled to take place between 24 October 2018 and 14 March 2019. This start had to be delayed because the pilot fieldwork period needed to be extended by four weeks, after which the final survey design was discussed and changes were made to the survey materials. Table 15 shows the fieldwork dates and the distribution of the number of interviews planned, achieved (before applying the quality criteria) and accepted (after applying the quality criteria) across survey groups and countries. The number of interviews originally requested by FRA in the technical specifications of the survey 34 could not be fully reached. Each country encountered various challenges in the implementation of the survey, as detailed later in this chapter (in Sections 6.1.2, 6.2.3 and 6.7). Some of the difficulties encountered could not be fully followed up and remedied in the time available for the fieldwork. The indicative target sample sizes identified in the technical specifications for each country were revised following the contractor\u2019s technical offer, input from the background research, findings from the pilot (numbers not included in this table) and, finally, assessment made after the first interviews of the main-stage fieldwork had been completed (\u2018Revised sample size\u2019). A total of 4 715 interviews were achieved; out of those, 4 659 interviews were accepted and included in the final data set, providing information on 12 893 respondents and members of their households. 34 FRA (n.d.), \u2018 Annex A \u2013 D-SE-17-T02 \u2013 Roma and Travellers Survey 2018 \u2013 Tender specifications \u2018, FRA (n.d.), \u2018 Annex A \u2013 D-SE-17-T02 \u2013 Roma and Travellers Survey 2018 \u2013 Tender specifications amended \u2018,. 6.

D Respondents and household members in the households of accepted interviews. 6.1.1. Fieldwork progress The progress of the fieldwork was monitored on a weekly basis using a number of indicators including the number of interviews achieved, the response rate, and the number of PSUs/SSUs issued and started. The revised main-stage fieldwork period was planned from December 2018 to the end of March 2019. Because of several challenges, which are described in this chapter, the fieldwork period was extended and interviews were finally completed in mid-July 2019 (Table 16). In Belgium, the winter months contributed to a slow start to the fieldwork with both Roma and Caravan dwellers. It also took a long time for the fieldwork teams to establish trust in the community. On some occasions the fieldwork had to be paused until meditators were available to facilitate access to respondents, as the mediators had regular work to do in parallel and were engaged in the survey in their leisure time. At times, mediators struggled to find people willing to participate in the survey, particularly among the Roma community in Charleroi and the Caravan dwellers in the Wallonia Region, where the halting sites were closed during the winter months. In both groups it was ",
        "51 not possible to reach the target sample size set for the Wallonia Region, and the planned interviews were shifted to other municipalities, where possible (Brussels and Ghent). The local team in Belgium attended celebrations for International Roma Day in Antwerp on 7 April 2019 to build relationships with mediators and the local community, who were able to share referrals. In May 2019, there was a large police operation in the camps in Belgium, during which many Roma and Travellers were arrested 35 . This created further concern among the community and made it even more difficult to reach the Travellers living in the Wallonia Region. In France, there were some delays in the start of the full fieldwork, since the sampling process took longer than expected owing to the need for extensive mapping of the halting sites and the differences found in the population sizes when comparing different data sources. The full fieldwork started in April 2019. Travelling through France was more challenging (particularly on Saturdays) because of protests by the \u2018yellow vest\u2019 movement, although interviewers tried not to schedule interviews during the protests. In one French department there was a small protest by Travellers against the local authorities, so the fieldwork continued only when the situation had calmed down. In one region the local authority, which plays a decisive role in managing the halting sites, was not willing to support the survey and did not give its consent for interviewers to visit the sites. In Ireland, it took longer to establish trust and cooperation with the Traveller communities. The fieldwork started with non-Traveller interviewers and was delayed until mid-March. To improve reach, the contractor started recruiting interviewers with a Traveller background from late March onwards. Traveller interviewers started their part of the fieldwork in May. Work with mediators was sometimes slow and, in Cork, not all interviews could take place because the mediators were not available. In the Netherlands, despite the close involvement of respected community organisations, the fieldwork with both survey groups was hampered by the communities\u2019 mistrust of participating in a survey conducted (as it seemed to the respondents) on behalf of the government or any other official institution. For the Roma, the leaders of the community organisation (RFU) were responsible for recruiting all respondents. It proved difficult to find respondents to fulfil the set quotas, because information was lacking on where Roma live in the Netherlands. To obtain this information, substantial efforts were needed to build relationships with local Roma organisations in each municipality (where one existed), and in other cases mediators\u2019 or interviewers\u2019 own social connections had to be used to find eligible respondents. For Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands, the sampling process was time- consuming. This was in part the reason for the slow progress throughout fieldwork. The VSWRN visited each sampled site to introduce the survey, secure access for the interviewers and gather additional information for random selection of the pitches. During the first few months of fieldwork the refusal rate among respondents (25 %) was much higher than expected. To achieve a sufficient number of interviews, interviewers were given the option of non-random selection of respondents (in case of refusal or absence of the randomly selected person) in March, and further SSUs were issued. In Sweden, a well-known member of the Roma community who was employed as a consultant for the project, to provide advice, mediation 35 The large-scale police operation \u2018Strike\u2019 took place on 7 May 2019 in various residential car parks. ",
        "52 and recruitment assistance, could not work on the survey, as a result of unforeseen circumstances. This happened in the beginning of the fieldwork phase and the NSEs then took on this role, but had to take time to travel to the different municipalities, build relationships with the communities and identify new organisations that are in contact with Roma, to support the fieldwork activities. Slow progress (especially in Malm\u00f6) led to the addition of the Uppsala municipality to the fieldwork in the week commencing 27 May 2019. In the United Kingdom, the fieldwork started slowly, as it coincided with Christmas and New Year, but also because of a lack of fieldwork capacity. To mitigate this, more interviewers were identified and allocated to the survey. Several other factors also contributed to the slow progress. \u2015 Samples were prepared in batches. Interviewers could not always start working on the project immediately after training, because some delays occurred when a new or reserve sample had to be issued. \u2015 Throughout the fieldwork the interviewers faced issues with accessing sites, i.e. being refused entry or aggressive behaviour from residents. This had an adverse effect on interviewer motivation. \u2015 Some of the sites were located in areas with only few interviewers, so the team had to recruit interviewers who were willing to work in areas that were a considerable distance from their own homes. \u2015 A TV channel in the United Kingdom aired a show that was ill received by the Traveller communities. In some sites, rumours spread that the survey was affiliated with the show. This made it more difficult for interviewers to gain access. \u2015 In the later months of the fieldwork, in the spring and early summer, interviewers started to report that the Travellers had started to leave the sites, which resulted in the sample being less productive than expected. TABLE 16: NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS (ACCEPTED, AFTER QUALITY CONTROL) EACH MONTH OF THE FIELDWORK PERIOD BY SURVEY GROUPA Target group December 2018 January 2019 February 2019 March 2019 April 2019 May 2019 June 2019 July 2019 BE Roma 8 38 50 89 191 90 16 0 BE Traveller (Caravan dwellers) 10 18 48 31 10 7 0 0 FR Travellers (Gens du voyage) 0 0 97 362 533 231 319 2 IE Travellers 0 0 0 28 108 152 53 177 NL Roma 33 38 58 49 23 0 0 0 NL Travellers and Sinti 4 37 37 118 120 171 24 0 SE Roma and Travellers 15 3 74 34 50 73 155 0 UK Gypsies and Travellers 13 8 37 156 257 110 294 0 A Figures are based on the accepted interviews. ",
        "53 6.1.2. Meeting sample size targets at survey group level Targets were met in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Sweden, but not in Ireland or the United Kingdom. The additional efforts required to achieve the required sample came at a financial cost, with expenditure on fieldwork and communication with mediators exceeding the expected budgets. The final sample size in Ireland was 518, below the target sample size of 650, but not below the minimum in-country sample size of 400 set in the technical specifications. The fieldwork progress varied in different areas of the country. The fieldwork started first, and proceeded well, in the areas where it was planned from the beginning that Ipsos MORI\u2019s (non-Traveller) interviewers would work alone. Work in the areas where Traveller interviewers worked alone started later in fieldwork and were also completed on time. In the areas identified where mediators would be needed to support the non- Traveller interviewers, the progress was variable. It took several months and a lot of effort to appoint the mediators and introduce them to the respective interviewers. In 13 PSUs, the mediators were only allocated in July 2019, resulting in a delayed start to the fieldwork in these areas. In the Cork area, it was only possible to conduct a very limited number of interviews because mediators were not available. In seven PSUs in other regions, support could not be secured and some PSUs could not be accessed. This, coupled with the delay to starting fieldwork in those areas, meant that fieldwork had to be closed before the target sample size could be reached. The final sample size for Gypsies and Travellers in the United Kingdom was 875, below the target sample size of 1 100. During the fieldwork it became apparent that the sample was less productive than expected, since the Traveller caravan count and local authority Gypsy and Traveller accommodation lists were not comprehensive, often out of date and very variable in the quality of information. Backup sites were added and the number of interviewers working on the project was increased, but the backup sites also turned out to be less productive than expected, or not productive at all, so fieldwork was not efficient. In many cases, interviewers had further issues accessing sites because there was no dedicated site manager, or there were security gates preventing access. Moreover, it took a considerable amount of time to build trust with the mediators and local communities. 6.2. MAKING CONTACT AND CONTACT SHEETS This section details the experiences interviewers had making contact with respondents, working with mediators and using both contact sheets. 6.2.1. Visiting primary sampling units/sites On average, sampling points or sites 36 were visited four times; efforts to reach the sites exceeded the minimum requirement of two visits per site. The number of visits varied between groups, with interviewers in Belgium (Roma) carrying out at least six visits and interviewers in the Netherlands carrying out a maximum of four visits to meet their quotas. Interviewers in the countries with the largest sample sizes (France and the United Kingdom) completed fewer visits per sampling point / site on average. 6.2.2. Contact sheets For the main fieldwork, different types of contact sheet were used: \u2015 the PSU contact sheet for collecting information at the PSU level; 36 Halting sites in France and sampling points (PSUs or SSUs) in the other countries. ",
        "54 \u2015 the ECS for collecting data at the household/respondent level and to screen for and select eligible respondents; The interviewer was required to collect information about each PSU that they visited in the PSU contact sheets (on paper). The PSU contact sheet also provided interviewers with details about the PSU they would be working in, for example on the type of PSU and the sampling unit. A number of challenges were encountered in practice because the information was collected on paper (e.g. empty fields, or missing or wrong entries that could be avoided with automated checks). For the future, electronically integrated PSU contact sheets in the CAPI software are recommended for faster, automatised and more accurate administration. The use of the ECSs was relatively straightforward for experienced interviewers. The ECS could be completed offline in case internet connection was not available. The completion was more challenging for newly recruited interviewers from the community, since it took them longer to fill in the answers, which created tension when they were completing the ECS in front of a respondent. Further guidance by the NSE and the CCT was provided to the community interviewers. 6.2.3. Making contact with respondents Interviewers in all countries were required to make contact with respondents face to face to invite them to participate in the survey. The ease of gaining respondents\u2019 participation varied between and within countries, and was often dependent on the involvement of mediators and how trusting the target group were. Regardless of the presence of mediators, additional time was often needed to build trust with individual respondents. In the countries using random sampling (France, the Netherlands (Travellers/ Sinti) and the United Kingdom), interviewers were required to make a minimum of two visits to each address before it could be assigned a final non-contact outcome code. Interviewers were encouraged to revisit at different times of the day and during different days of the week, wherever possible, in order to help maximise the response rate. Around a quarter of visits occurred in the evening and around one fifth during the weekend (24 % and 18 %, respectively). In the final contact sheet data, 12 % of addresses in the random sample have the final outcome \u2018non-contact\u2019. On making contact at a household, interviewers had to establish if there were any eligible people within the household, randomly select one or two people (two in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom only) and attempt to interview them. Screening on self-identification for Roma and Travellers worked well, and respondents were able to answer the screening questions easily. In Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden, a quota sampling approach was used so there were no minimum requirements on the minimum number of visits to be made. Mediators (and in Ireland in some cases also interviewers) were mainly responsible for recruiting respondents and making the initial contact. After the mediator secured an interview, they passed the contact details on to the interviewer so that they could finalise the arrangements and conduct the interview. After the information had been passed from the mediator to the interviewer, it took an average of one contact attempt (as recorded in the ECS), this means contact with the first respondent at one address, to secure an interview (in rare cases up to three were needed). Belgium Caravan dwellers were found to be easier to approach than the Roma; they have lived in Belgium for a longer time, over several generations, had good relationships with the mediators and speak the national languages well. ",
        "55 They also tended to show more interest in the survey and trust than the Roma. The involvement of mediators was essential for the willingness of the respondents to participate in both groups. The mediators introduced the interviewers and the survey to the communities, showing them that they trusted the interviewer and the survey. This impact was even greater when the mediators were known to the respondents. The time it took meditators to arrange interviews varied from one phone call to multiple face-to-face meetings. The willingness of the interviewers to spend extra time with respondents seemed to increase the success rate. Regarding the survey material, the video and postcard were deemed most useful; respondents showed very little interest in the other materials (introduction letter, list of supporting organisations, etc.). France Travellers (Gens du voyage) were often suspicious of interviewers entering the halting site, not welcoming them or considering them to be working for the police or social services. However, once the interviewer was able to clearly explain the purpose of the survey, they were welcomed, and many households were willing to take part. The average number of contact attempts made per address was 1 (ranging from 1 to 12). Working alongside a site manager was helpful for the interviewer, and halting sites with site managers were around 10 percentage points more often productive (that is, leading to at least one interview) than those without site managers. It also had a positive impact if interviewers introduced themselves to the respondents together with the site managers, as it reduced suspicion and the site managers could advise the interviewers how best to approach potential respondents. The interviewers stated that the postcard was the most useful material for establishing contact. The day or time of the visit did not seem to have a great effect on the response rate. Ireland In Ireland, there were no reports of respondents being unwilling to self-identify as a Traveller. The non-Traveller interviewers did report experiencing some mistrust from the community. The video and the postcard were most helpful for establishing contact. Regarding the use of mediators, it was agreed with the country\u2019s main Roma and Traveller organisation, Pavee Point, that interviewing would be conducted using a mix of: \u2015 the contractor\u2019s (Ipsos MRBI\u2019s) interviewers working alone in areas where Pavee Point did not have a network of interviewers or mediators; \u2015 Ipsos MRBI interviewers working together with Pavee Point mediators in areas where this cooperation seemed necessary to gain access and where Pavee Point had a network of mediators; \u2015 Traveller interviewers working alone (from May onwards). The involvement of mediators in the project was essential for facilitating access to halting sites, assisting with recruitment and providing general support to the interviewers in Galway, Cork and Kerry. However, it was challenging to make contact with mediators from these regions. In the end it was not possible to reach mediators in Cork in time and interviewing could only take place in a few cases. Interviewers were able to work without mediators in Dublin, as they had experience working with communities in the area on other surveys. The main barrier to accessing sampling points was a lack of mediator support in certain areas. In 10 out of 65 PSUs in Ireland it was not possible to conduct the survey because mediators were not available to assist in the fieldwork owing to operational problems. ",
        "56 Netherlands For Roma (quota sampling), it would not have been possible to approach and to recruit respondents for the survey without the cooperation of the RFU. The RFU has sufficient knowledge and connections to approach Roma communities throughout the Netherlands and was able to encourage specific groups among the Roma (e.g. older people) to participate. Personal knowledge of a member of the RFU was very beneficial for persuading respondents to participate in the survey. In general, it proved to be more difficult than the RFU expected to prevail on people to participate. This was because of mistrust of the government and research. Many people refused to take part, while those who arranged appointments often did not show up at all. Information concerning missed appointments was not systematically recorded; however, it seemed that women were more difficult to recruit than men. Some of the topics included in the questionnaire (income, health and home facilities) proved to be sensitive within the community, which also showed in high levels of item non-response. For Travellers/Sinti (random sampling), the average number of contact attempts made per address was 1. However, very rarely more attempts were necessary; the maximum was eight. The interviewers\u2019 arrival at the sites was at times met with suspicion and mistrust, as well as concerns about privacy, and about the usefulness of the research and participating in it. This contributed to the higher than expected refusal rate among Travellers/Sinti in the Netherlands. Arranging interviews at the majority of sample points required at least two separate visits to the halting sites: one visit for handing out flyers and establishing contact by the representatives from the VSRWN or the interviewer, followed by one or more visits to the selected households to ask them to participate. The survey benefited from the initial visit by the VSRWN or the interviewer to the selected halting sites. This enabled easier access to the sites for the interviewers and secured better cooperation with the community members. Many halting site dwellers know the VSRWN, which had a positive effect on their willingness to participate. In addition, the personal networks of the community interviewers positively affected recruitment. In general, the best time to visit halting sites of the Travellers/Sinti was the evening, around 19.00 or 20.00. Some respondents reacted positively to the possibility of an interview with a second person from the household, while others did not want to take part in a second interview. The reasons given for refusal were the time and the types of questions asked (sensitive issues, repetitive patterns of questions on discrimination, etc.). For both target groups, face-to-face communication was found to be more important than any kind of written materials when establishing contact. Respondents rarely read the materials provided at the time of the visit. The video was better received. For both target groups, no barriers to accessing sampling points were reported. Sweden Roma in Sweden are often suspicious of strangers and of people from authorities, as a result of past negative experiences. It was difficult to establish contact, and the recruitment of respondents could only be undertaken by the mediators. This was the only way to reach a relatively large number of Roma and Travellers in Sweden, as there is limited interaction of Roma and Travellers with people outside the communities. It took a significant amount of time and effort to establish the relationships with the mediators in the first place and, as a result of the mediators\u2019 importance to the fieldwork, the work of the interviewers was entirely reliant on the availability of the ",
        "57 mediators. They were in direct contact with each other, with mediators informing interviewers about appointments that had been arranged, which worked relatively well. No specific differences in recruiting different types of respondents were reported. United Kingdom The average number of contact attempts made per address was 1; the maximum number of contact attempts made was 10. Reactions were very mixed when interviewers approached the sites. Many residents mistrusted them and their aims and were sometimes even hostile, telling the interviewers to leave. It was challenging to obtain site permission. Private owners would be reluctant to give permission because they perceived no benefit in taking part. With public sites, local authorities were often uncommunicative or unresponsive and it was hard to find the right person to speak to. Interviewers also faced a number of practical barriers to accessing sites (locked gates, loose dogs, etc.). Once one individual on site had completed the interview, it tended to be easier to gain buy-in from others on site. Interviewers also found mediators very helpful in gaining trust on site and encourage participation, especially when mediators knew somebody on the site. During the pilot it was found that respondents were reluctant to provide information about other household members, which prevented random selection of respondents. After interviewers were given more training on how to elicit information on all household members, and with the support of mediators, random selection of respondents within households was possible for the main stage of fieldwork. Owing to variations in literacy levels, interviewers did not tend to use the written survey materials, but would read out the introductory letter. The video was seen as useful, especially for those with lower literacy levels. An article was published in the online magazine Travellers\u2019 Times to help establish the legitimacy of the survey. Based on the findings of the background research, interviewers were advised not to visit in the evening, as this was family time. The interviewers\u2019 experience of completing a second household interview was mixed. Interviewers found that sometimes other members of the household volunteered to take part, wanting their opinion to be heard, and found it difficult to understand why the interviewer needed to adhere to random selection. 6.3. INTERVIEW ADMINISTRATION AND LANGUAGE 6.3.1. Language in which the interview was conducted Interviews were mainly conducted in the national language and the language of the questionnaire script in CAPI. However, in some cases, the respondent spoke another language more comfortably, and, if the interviewer or mediator spoke the same language, questions were read in both languages and the respondent could answer in the language they felt more comfortable with. In France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the interviews were conducted in the national language and no language issues were reported. In the Netherlands, and very rarely in Ireland and the United Kingdom, the interview process was sometimes supported with on-the-spot interpretation into Romani. For Roma in Belgium, a substantial proportion of the interviews was conducted in Bulgarian (11 %), Romanian (10 %) and Slovak (23 %). Several interviews in Belgium were conducted with on-the-spot interpretations into Serbo-Croatian and into unspecified Romani languages. The category \u2018Other\u2019 in Table 17 refers to 13 interviews that were conducted in two languages (e.g. Slovak and Romani or English and Romani). ",
        "58 6.3.2. Respondents\u2019 literacy levels Interviewers working across all countries and target groups reported that low literacy levels were an issue, as the survey used written introductory materials and show cards. In order to avoid uncomfortable tension when handing out the written materials, the interviewers read out the information on the advance materials, as well as the show cards. In all countries the interviewers also used the video to convey information about the survey when they suspected a respondent had difficulties reading. 6.3.3. Comprehension of the questionnaire At the end of the questionnaire, interviewers provided their own assessment of the extent to which the respondent understood the questions. The results are illustrated in Table 18. The numbers suggest that Caravan dwellers in Belgium (8 %) had the most difficulty in fully understanding the questionnaire.

        "59 According to interviewers, 66 % of respondents were able to understand all the questions, and 29 % understood most of them. However, overall, 34 % encountered at least some difficulties in understanding the questions. The way the questions or items were phrased was the most common reason why respondents did not understand questions. This could mean the length of the questions, the vocabulary used and/or the concepts included. Table 19 shows the prevalence of reasons in each target group.

        "60 6.3.4. Respondent and interviewer perceptions of the questionnaire Overall, the questionnaire worked well and respondents appreciated the interest shown in their living conditions and experiences. However, a number of difficulties were encountered while interviewing. Respondents\u2019 feedback was collected by open text question at the end of the interview. Interviewer feedback was collected in a special section of the interview (interviewer answers (IA) questions). The fieldwork agency also debriefed interviewers separately once they finished their fieldwork. Then there was also a debriefing session between the local agency and FRA. The results of the sessions and the country visits conducted by FRA are summarised in Table 20 and described in further detail following the table. The issues raised were raised by a very limited number of respondents/interviewers and should not have a significant impact on the data quality.

        "61 For five out of eight target groups, the interviewers report that 90 % or more of the respondents were (very) interested in the topics of the survey (Table 21). Only in France, among Roma in Belgium and among Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands is the share lower (81 %, 85 % and 89 %). Question/section/topic Issues raised Country that the comment is applicable to Missing situation of discrimination in the questionnaire Some respondents in Belgium stated that the situations in which they feel discriminated against are not covered by the questionnaire (e\ufffdg\ufffd the absence of Roma history in the school curriculum) BE Lack of knowledge in order to answer some questions on household / place of residence Some respondents were not in a position to answer questions because they did not know the answer\ufffd This may have been the case (especially for younger respondents) when asked about their household, place of residence or household (parents\u2019) income All countries Impression of respondents that questions were asked to confirm stereotypes Question SI01 (sources of income) was perceived as to some degree problematic in Ireland\ufffd Question DO24 (asked to pay bribe) was considered inappropriate and offensive by some of the respondents in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as it was considered to paint the community in a negative light IE, NL, UK Suggestion for additional items/questions The verbatims revealed a number of items respondents missed among the answer options given to adequately reflect their responses\ufffd In Sweden, it was suggested to ask if respondents were open about disclosing their ethnicity to people who are not Roma or Travellers All countries, SE TABLE 21: RESPONDENTS\u2019 INTEREST IN THE TOPICS OF THE SURVEY BY TARGET GROUP (%) A,B Target group Very interested Somewhat interested Not very interested Not at all interested BE Roma 29 56 13 2 BE Travellers (Caravan dwellers) 51 44 6 0 FR Travellers (Gens du voyage) 26 55 15 4 IE Travellers 59 35 4 1 NL Roma 67 28 4 0 NL Travellers and Sinti 60 29 10 2 SE Roma and Travellers 74 24 2 0 UK Gypsies and Travellers 48 42 9 1 Total 44 43 10 2 A Figures are based on the accepted interviews, answers to question IA12, \u2018How interested, if at all, was the respondent in the topics of the study?\u2019, a nswered; n = 4 659.

The presence of other people during the interview may affect some responses of the interviewee, for example in cases of experience of harassment/physical violence when the perpetrator is a household member. It could, however, also be beneficial for data quality in cases of the estimation of household income by younger respondents. In most cases, respondents were alone throughout the whole interview, as illustrated in Table 22. ",
        "62 Table 23 provides an overview of who was present during part or all of the interview, in cases when the interviewer and the respondent were not alone the whole time. This could be relevant because the other person present could have an influence on the answering pattern of the respondent in order to avoid socially undesirable situations or repercussions that could derive from their answers. The table also shows the number of interviews during which a mediator or another interviewer was present throughout the interview. The presence of a mediator during the interview varies across countries. While having mediators was key to accessing the target groups, once trust had been built the respondents were happy to complete the interview without the presence of the mediator. It should be noted that mediators make up a large proportion of the persons present during the interviews in Sweden.

INCENTIVES In Belgium, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom, respondents were offered an incentive in the form of low-value gift vouchers and cash, conditional on completion of the survey, and used as a way of thanking the respondents for their time. These incentives were mostly appreciated by respondents and seen as a valuable means of recruiting respondents or thanking them for their time. Around 20 % of the respondents in France, 22 % in the United Kingdom and 6 % in Sweden declined the incentive (Table 25); some felt that the low amount offered was offensive or they did not feel it was necessary because they appreciated having their views heard. No incentives were handed out to the respondents in Ireland and the Netherlands; it was agreed with the community organisations that the incentives would go directly to the entire community.

        "64 6.5. INTERVIEWERS\u2019 FEEDBACK ON THE FIELDWORK SUPPORT MATERIALS The introductory letter was handed out to all respondents in all countries, but it was not often read by the respondents (for various reasons, including in some cases low literacy levels). Interviewers started by either reading the letter or explaining the content to the respondents before handing it over. The letters may have had limited efficacy in this context. The postcard with brief information on FRA, the survey objectives, the sample size, types of questions, methodology and the indication of when the results would be available was handed out to all respondents in all countries and was received more positively than the letter, with respondents more likely to read or attempt to read it. The interviewers felt that the postcard was useful to demonstrate the legitimacy of the survey, explain the purpose succinctly and help to start a relationship with respondents. Mediators also sometimes used the postcards for recruitment purposes. The introductory video was produced for each country/language to be used by the interviewers and mediators in order to introduce the survey to respondents. It briefly described the purpose of the study, the methodology and how the results would be used. The video was well received and is recommended for future use (and again could be seen as a replacement for the letter). The privacy notice was handed out to respondents in all countries, and interviewers made efforts to explain the contents where necessary. While interviewers acknowledged the importance of the privacy notice, respondents rarely read the (long) document or did not understand the concept. Less technical language would have been more useful. 6.6. FIELDWORK OUTCOMES \u2013 RANDOM SAMPLING This chapter provides an overview of the fieldwork outcomes where random sampling was used to approach the target group, i.e. in France, the Netherlands (Traveller/Sinti) and the United Kingdom. 6.6.1. Response rate Table 26 provides a summary of fieldwork outcomes by country and the associated response rate. This is based at household level and is only provided for target groups where a random probability approach was used. The final outcome \u2018Ineligible household\u2019 describes a resident household that is not eligible for the survey (e.g. no self-identified Roma or Travellers living in the household, ineligible for other reason). The final outcome \u2018Unknown eligibility\u2019 was used if all information was refused, or if screening was not possible because of language barriers or because the whole household was away or in hospital during the fieldwork phase. Eligible households include completed interviews (the calculations include only accepted interviews), partial interviews, interviews refused by the target respondents before their interview, refusal by proxy (other household member) after the respondent selection, refusal during the interview, broken appointment, no recontact, screened out (respondent was identified as eligible but refused to participate or provide essential information during the interview) or the respondent was away or in hospital during the fieldwork period. Interviewed households include only those where at least one interview was completed. ",
        "65 The eligibility rate e is calculated as follows: \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = ! \"#$ & '()#) The response rate is calculated at household level in accordance with the definition of Response Rate 3 by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) 37 : \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = ! \"#$ & '()#) 6.6.2. Number of second interviews In the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti) and in the United Kingdom, interviewers were allowed to interview two respondents per household. In the Netherlands, 81 out of 511 (16 %) accepted interviews with Travellers/Sinti were conducted with a second respondent. In the United Kingdom, 129 out of 875 (15 %) accepted interviews were carried out with a second respondent. 6.6.3. Random selection of respondents In the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti) and in the United Kingdom, the interviewer did not have to conduct the random selection of the respondent if the household refused this element but otherwise agreed to take part. In the Netherlands, 42 (8 %) accepted interviews were conducted with Travellers/Sinti who were not randomly selected. In the United Kingdom this was the case for 185 (21 %) accepted interviews. How this is dealt with during weighting is described in Section 8.1.3. There is no difference between the percentages of women and men among the non-randomly selected respondents in the Netherlands. In the United Kingdom the distribution is very imbalanced with an overrepresentation of women (71 % versus 29 %); however, this largely matches the gender distribution among randomly selected respondent (67 % versus 33 %). There are no large differences in the patterns of the age distribution between randomly and non-randomly selected respondents (Table 27). 37 AAPOR (2011), Standard Definitions: Final dispositions of case codes and outcome rates for surveys, 7th edition, AAPOR, p. 46.

        "66 6.6.4. Number of primary sampling units where a full census was done A full census was completed in 106 out of 160 (partially) productive SSUs (66 %) in France and in 146 out of 152 (partially) productive SSUs (96 %) in the United Kingdom. This indicates that sites were smaller than expected. In the Netherlands, sites were expected at the outset to be small, so it was decided to do a full census in each site and not use a sampling interval. 6.6.5. Age and gender distribution of respondents and household members Table 28 shows that gender distribution is more or less balanced for household members in all three survey groups with a random household selection approach. Among respondents there is a slight overrepresentation of women in France and the Netherlands, and a significant overrepresentation of women in the United Kingdom. The age distribution of respondents does differ quite significantly in the Netherlands, where young respondents are less represented in the sample. Background research indicates that this might reflect the actual age distribution, as younger Travellers progressively stop living at a mobile home location, because of the \u2018extinction policy\u2019 ( uitsterfbeleid \u2013 a policy aimed at reducing the number of mobile houses and pitches per municipality) 38 . 38 See Blaakman et al.

        "67 6.7. FIELDWORK OUTCOMES \u2013 QUOTA SAMPLING Quota sampling was used in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden. This subsection provides an overview of the regional targets, minimum quotas on age by gender and other \u2018soft\u2019 quotas set for each target group, the performance against these targets and quotas, and any reasons for deviations from these. It is not possible to calculate a response rate for the quota samples. These are non-probabilistic samples, so the AAPOR concepts of response rates are not applicable. The eligibility rate is unknown, and the denominators cannot be calculated. 6.7.1. Quotas set and achieved For each sampling unit a quota was set on the total number of interviews expected. Within this target, interlocked quotas on gender by age (six categories in total, with three categories used for age) were also set. In order to provide some degree of tolerance \u2013 given the lack of local-level data available \u2013 the gender by age quotas were set as minimum quotas, totalling 75 % of the total sample size. In addition, targets on regional distribution (or the distribution across selected municipalities) were set in all groups, proportional to size in the sample frame distribution. Therefore, they totalled 100 % of the target sample size (as described in Table 13). Further \u2018soft\u2019 quotas totalling less than the 75 % threshold used for age by gender quotas were used in Ireland for type of accommodation (up to 60 % of the target sample size), in the Netherlands for the various Roma groups (up to 43%) and in Sweden for the various groups of Roma/Travellers (up to 55 %), and in Belgium (Travellers) for the type of sites (73 %) to promote further heterogeneity and balancing of the sample. The tables in this subsection show the targets and quotas that were set at the beginning of fieldwork and the revised targets/quota that were determined during data collection, after experiences gained in the early stages of the fieldwork. 6.6.6. Productivity of sampling points Sampling points in the Netherlands were the most productive, with no issues hindering fieldwork reported, as illustrated in Table 29. Two SSUs in the Netherlands were replaced because the local supervisors advised that potential respondents would be suspicious of the research. In France and the United Kingdom, halting sites were less productive than expected. In both countries, the main issue was that sites were empty, destroyed or not populated. This eventually contributed to not being able to reach the full sample size in the United Kingdom. In a few cases in France, a site was not accessed because it was considered too dangerous for the interviewer to go there.

C Quotas for age by gender were set as minimum targets adding up to 75 % of the target sample size. D Soft quotas for the types of site were set as minimum targets adding up to 73 % of the target sample size. Belgium (Caravan dwellers) Owing to the unavailability of mediators and therefore difficulties in reaching respondents during data collection, the sample from the Wallonia Region needed to be reallocated across the Brussels Region and the Flemish Region, and the overall sample size needed to be reduced (Table 30). The additional interviews were allocated to the Roma community instead (see Section 6.7). Following the reallocation of the sample from the Wallonia Region to the Roma target group, the regional targets were met. Quotas for age by gender were recalculated accordingly and met for almost all subgroups. There was a slight shortfall of men aged 30\u201344 (three interviews short) and women aged 30\u201344 (two interviews short) vis-\u00e0-vis the quotas. The quotas for the type of site were exceeded for those living on private sites. There was a slight shortfall in those living on temporary and residential sites (three and four interviews short, respectively). While the number of interviews for private sites was exceeded, given that interviewing was only possible in 9 % of identified sites of this type it is likely that this part of the population is underrepresented in the data. ",
        "69 Belgium (Roma) During data collection, the sample from Charleroi had to be reallocated across Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp because it became increasingly difficult (because of mediator inavailability) to conduct any research in the Charleroi region. The quotas for age by gender were recalculated accordingly. Similarly, because of difficulties with fieldwork in Sint-Niklaas, the sample was, where possible, relocated to Brussels and Ghent. Following the revision of the regional quota targets in Belgium, the fieldwork team reached the minimum target in all regions except for Sint-Niklaas and met or exceeded the revised quotas for age by gender (Table 31).

Ireland Because of difficulties in organising the timely support of mediators in some regions and the delayed start of the fieldwork, the total target sample size of 650 was not reached (518 accepted interviews) and regional targets were not achieved (Table 32). In the South-West region around Cork it was only possible to conduct a very limited number of interviews. Quotas were set for age by gender and for the type of accommodation (halting site or other type of accommodation). Some quota targets were not met because the total sample size was not reached. The quotas set for both accommodation types were exceeded. Despite the final sample size being below the target sample size upon which the minimum quotas were set, the sample can still be seen as representative (with the exception of Cork). ",

        "73 6.7.2. Age and gender distribution of respondents and household members Table 35 shows that the gender distribution is more or less balanced for respondents and household members in the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden, and for household members in Belgium (Roma) and Ireland. Among respondents, women are underrepresented in Belgium (46 % versus 54 % for both Roma and Caravan dwellers). Among Caravan dweller household members, however, they are overrepresented (56 %). Respondents in Ireland are more often female than male (56 % versus 44 %). The age distribution of respondents does not differ much from the distribution among household members in Belgium. The age profile of respondents seems to be more balanced than the profile of the other household members in Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands (Roma).

For each target group different limits were set for the total number of interviews one interviewer could conduct. Any deviations from this were to be discussed with the CCT in advance. This rule was largely adhered to, but in some cases it was not possible to do so. Reasons for going over the target included the following, for example. \u2015 It was difficult to recruit interviewers with certain backgrounds (Roma, Traveller or Sinti) or with certain language skills (for Bulgarian-, Romanian- and Slovakian-speaking respondents in Belgium). \u2015 Some interviewers were the only ones who could cover a certain area. \u2015 Some interviewers needed to work all of the addresses issued in a PSU. It would not have made sense for a different interviewer to take over the PSU, even though it meant the interviewer exceeding their interview quota. \u2015 Mediators scheduled more interviews than needed in case one or more respondents did not show up. In cases where all respondents did arrive for their interviews, these were not cancelled even if the target number of interviews had been met. 6.8.2. Fieldwork control This subsection provides an overview of the measures put in place to ensure that high quality standards were met during the fieldwork. The local agencies were in regular contact with the interviewers and mediators in the field, as well as with the CCT, to ensure that the sampling approach was applied, that any deviations from the protocol were agreed in advance, ",
        "75 and that interviewers were performing well and understood the project requirements. As specified in the quality assurance plan (see Annex 12.2), every national agency was required to re-contact a minimum of 10 % of respondents to validate the interviewers\u2019 work. Local agencies were required to use one of two methods to carry out the callbacks: \u2015 by telephone: respondents were contacted by a member of the validation team and asked to confirm details of their interviews; \u2015 by post: a postage paid card was given to the respondent, who was asked to confirm demographic and survey details. It was not possible to conduct telephone back-checking with Roma in the Netherlands and Sweden because interviewers were not able to collect the names, telephone numbers or addresses of individuals. This was because respondents were very cautious about giving out personal details. Instead interviewers handed out postage paid cards that included some demographic and survey questions, which could be mailed back to the NSE for verification. In addition, the local teams verified with mediators/supervisors that interviews took place and the respondent did not raise any issues about working with the interviewer. The local team in the Netherlands also regularly checked the GPS coordinates of the interviews to compare them with the coordinates of the sampling point. Table 38 provides an overview of the back-checking approach in each country along with the outcomes. FRA conducted fieldwork observation visits to France, Ireland, the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti), Sweden and the United Kingdom. FRA shared feedback and suggestions with the local agencies as well as with the CCT, for example that a variable should be included in the ECS that records who arranged the interview, that specific questions should be rephrased for better understanding by the respondent, or that show cards should be shown for all long scales. Further instructions or reminders were sent out to the local interviewers as appropriate. ",

        "77 7.1. DATA FILES All data files were delivered to FRA without personal details such as names or addresses. There are three main data sets for the Roma and Travellers Survey, each with its own codebook: \u2015 the individual register (IR); \u2015 the ECS; \u2015 the PSU file; The IR includes data from the questionnaire for all productive interviews. It contains a row for each respondent interviewed and for each household member recorded in the household grid. Each household has a unique identifier (HHID), which enables members of the same household to be linked. The HHID is a 13-digit number, starting with 1, continuing with two digits denoting the country, and ending with ten digits denoting a unique household. For the purposes of the survey, each individual was assigned a unique personal identifier (PID). This is a 15-digit number formed of the HHID plus two digits. The first respondent who took part in the survey is always listed first, having a PID ending with 01. The remaining household members are then listed in the order they were listed by the respondent when completing the household grid, and the PIDs are allocated in sequential order. If a second household member was interviewed, they appear in the order that they were listed by the first respondent, and their PID will end in the corresponding two digits. The variable \u2018Resp\u2019 denotes whether the individual was the first respondent interviewed, the second respondent interviewed or a household member who did not participate. Household-level data provided by the first respondent were copied across for all household members (variables HH01 39 , HLSN01 40 to SI09 41 and SI01_01 42 to SI06 43 ). 39 Number of household\u2019s members. 40 How long have you (your household) been living here in this neighbourhood (place)? 41 In the past month, have you or anyone in the household ever gone to bed hungry because there was not enough money for food? IF YES, how often did this happen in the past month? 42 Kinds of income that household has received in last 12 months. 43 Thinking of your household\u2019s total income, is your household able to make ends meet? 7. DATA PROCESSING AND DATA FILES ",
        "78 The IR file also includes the interviewer demographics 44 (where consent was given by the interviewers to include these) and the weighting variables. Furthermore, the IR file includes the following variables: \u2015 metadata, for example sampling group (variable SGR), criteria of eligibility (variable IN09), sampling frame (variable CN01), sampling method (variables STYP and SSEL), \u2015 paradata, for example interviewer feedback on each interview (IA variables), interviewer characteristics including sociodemographic characteristics (variables interviewer_sex, interviewer_age and interviewer_ethnic). FRA provides anonymised microdata for further research. A detailed codebook will be made available together with the data set and accessible on the project\u2019s website ( https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2020/roma- travellers-survey ). The ECS file includes data from the address-based sampling contact sheet for all survey groups. This file includes all sampled or selected addresses, contact attempts made by the interviewers, and interim and final outcome codes, and can be linked by the unique HHID and the unique PID for productive cases. The PSU file includes data from the sampling points such as the number of households visited, availability of mediators, barriers to the sampling point, the sampling interval and the total number of visits. This information was primarily collected through the PSU contact sheets. 7.2. DATA PROCESSING AND QUALITY CONTROL In all countries, the ECS and questionnaire were administered on tablets using Ipsos MORI\u2019s iField platform. For each case, the interviewer would first open an ECS to complete some initial details about their visit. Where applicable, they would then enter the questionnaire on iField. Once they had finished the interview, the iField script would take them back to the ECS to record an outcome code of the visit. Any data collected would be automatically saved to the device, and data were transferred to the Ipsos MORI data-processing (DP) team once the device had an internet connection. Once received, the DP team would process the data into SPSS format in accordance with the data structure defined in the codebook. The PSU contact sheet was not managed using iField but was administered separately either on the tablet or on paper. Local teams were required to perform quality checks on the PSU data and to submit these data to the CCT in Excel format, in accordance with a standardised template. These Excel files were then merged and converted into SPSS format. The questionnaire contained a number of questions, which had an \u2018other \u2013 specify\u2019 response code. When a respondent selected this option, their verbatim response was captured. During the DP, these responses were translated into English, and where possible they were back-coded into the existing code frame. In some instances, the back-coding brought questions on route, which were not on route during the interview with the original answers by the respondents. In these cases, the data are recorded as missing (code \u201392). To keep an overview of the data-related observations and issues and systematically provide explanations and verification, a data quality control 44 For Ireland, the variable interviewer_ethnic indicates whether the interviewer was from Ipsos MRBI or Pavee Point (\u2018Traveller interviewer\u2019) because the local agency does not collect or hold information on whether interviewers are from the target population or not. ",
        "79 log was established. It was updated and exchanged between FRA and the CCT on a rolling basis during and after fieldwork, until the data set was considered final. An ID code that was allocated to each issue was also included in the IR data set if the issue related directly to an interview that was under investigation or needed to be flagged in the data. Four interim data deliveries were sent to FRA for additional quality checks. The final weighted data were sent on 22 November 2019 (IR, ECS and PSU contact sheet files). The ECS data were regularly checked for logical errors during and after completion of fieldwork, including for consistency, missing values and completeness vis-\u00e0-vis the IR file. PSU data were centrally checked for completeness, correct routing and consistency vis-\u00e0-vis the ECS file to verify the final status (unproductive, partially productive or fully productive). In instances where the routing had not been followed, the local agencies were required to source and amend any missing data 45 . Various quality checks and DP steps were undertaken on the main interview (IR) data throughout main-stage fieldwork and after completion. \u2015 Local agencies were required to follow up on short interviews with the interviewers, verify GPS coordinates and back-check 10 % of interviews. Any irregularities were automatically flagged on iField for the local agencies to review, by inspecting the case in more detail, and occasionally liaising with the interviewer. The validation script ran on a daily basis and checked that the data matched the data map, the ID numbers were unique, only permitted values were inputted, no duplicate records were included, the routing was correct, and the information in the household grid and demographic information were consistent. \u2015 The data files were also checked for implausible answers, outliers and accuracy of derived variables. If unusual patterns or responses or issues across or within target groups were discovered 46 , the local agency, the survey experts or sampling experts concerned were consulted for possible explanations or confirmation of plausibility. \u2015 The IR data set was also checked for duplicate and near duplicate observations using the statistical software Stata, first looking for any duplicate PIDs or duplicate interviews 47 . Secondly, a measure of similarity 48 based on 45 Checks against the ECS data proved to be complicated for France, since the PSU contact sheets contained records for each caravan site in the sampling points. It was possible to detect logical errors but not to fully confirm the data in the PSU file, because the ECS only collected information for the whole sampling point, not per site. 46 A univariate outlier identification procedure was used in Stata. This approach ensures that the number of cases flagged is not inflated for skewed or heavy- tailed distributions by adjusting the conventional values for the whiskers in a boxplot (e.g. lower threshold = Q0.25 \u2212 1.5 IQR (interquartile range) and upper threshold = Q0.75 + 1.5 IQR). For more detail see V. Verardi and C. Vermandele (2018), \u2018Univariate and multivariate outlier identification for skewed or heavy- tailed distributions\u2019, Stata Journal , Vol. 18, No 3, pp. 517\u2013532. 47 Duplicate and near duplicate observations can be defined as where an entry in the data set has been duplicated (copied) or is very similar to other entries across the survey variables. A duplicate entry in the data might indicate that the responses of one respondent have been double-counted. Near duplication can be accidental or a result of an intentional effort by interviewers in the data collection stage. If the duplicates or near duplicate interviews are due to intentional effort, the internal logic of the survey is less likely to hold. 48 For further details see N. L. Kuriakose (2015) \u2018PERCENTMATCH: Stata module to calculate the highest percentage match (near duplicates) between observations\u2019, http://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/s457984. htm . ",
        "80 a range of substantive survey variables (questions HH01\u2013WB06, excluding demographic variables, interviewer questions and open-ended questions) was calculated. A number of near duplicates were expected as a result of questionnaire routing, item non-response (INR), second respondents\u2019 answers, and generally similar living conditions and experiences of respondents living in the same sampling point (especially among those living on caravan sites). Overall and country distribution of the percentage matched, indicating how similar two observations in the data set are to each other, did not indicate any obvious fraud 49 . The highly similar interviews were further evaluated case by case, by looking at a number of other quality indicators (e.g. level of item non-response and the results from back-checks) No obvious fraud was identified, and no interviews were selected for removal as a result of the checking for duplicate observations. \u2015 INR was regularly checked during fieldwork and appropriate measures were taken to address and minimise its occurrence. The local agencies contacted interviewers and enquired about any problems they had encountered while interviewing. Interviewers were given tips on how to encourage the respondent to give an answer to reduce the INR (that is, an item being coded with \u2018Refused\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t know\u2019 or a similar code). Overall, INR was more likely if respondents did not fully trust how their answers would be used, they considered it a social taboo to talk about the topic (for example income and health), they did not understand the question/terms/concepts or they did not know the answer (for example, someone living with their parents was less likely to know the monthly net income of the household). In total, 54 interviews had INR rates 50 equal to or more than 25 %, ranging from 0 interviews (0 %) in both Belgium and Sweden to 12 interviews (5.9 %) among the Roma in the Netherlands. France had 28 such cases (1.8 % of sample), Ireland 7 (1.3), Travellers/ Sinti in the Netherlands 4 (1.8 %) and the United Kingdom 3 (0.3 %). \u2015 Owing to the generally higher levels of missing data on income and the importance of having information on household income for all household members for calculating social inclusion indicators, respondents who were unable or unwilling to indicate the exact available household income were offered country-specific income bands. The income imputation for all survey groups was done by first imputing the income from income bands (done for all cases where income was not stated but the income band is available). More than 40 % of the respondents in France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom did not report their income in any way, and were therefore not considered for the full imputation process. For Roma and Travellers in Belgium and Sweden (fewer than 30 % of missings), the K nearest neighbour methodology imputation was applied. \u2015 In the Roma and Travellers Survey, no non-response was allowed for the questions on age and gender for all household members. If respondents were unable or unwilling to indicate the exact age, they were given the opportunity to indicate an age band. This was the case for fewer than 50 household members (out of 12 893, see Table 15); their exact age was imputed by using a random selection of household members (with exact age indications) within the same age band and country. Given the small number of imputed cases, the impact of the imputation was very small. 49 Mean percentage matched was 88 %, and the distribution did not peak at the right end of the scale, which is similar to the distributions from other social surveys. Overall, 4 % of interviews resulted in a maximum percentage match higher than 95 %. 50 Percentage of all questions that were answered by the respondent. A value was seen as a missing value if it was coded as \u201396 (refusal), \u201397 (doesn\u2019t understand the question), \u201398 (not applicable) or \u201399 (don\u2019t know) in the IR file. ",
        "81 Following internal quality checks on interview length and INR, 55 interviews were selected for removal. All interviews with more than 45 % of INR, and those in which the average time spent per variable was less than 4.34 seconds, were selected for exclusion 51 . The final decision to remove an interview took into account the challenges in the fieldwork: technical issues in measuring time, which led to shorter interview lengths than interviewers and respondents recalled; sensitive questions leading to higher numbers of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 and refusal responses; and lower education levels leading to higher number of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses. Where interviews were flagged as potentially suspicious or failing the quality criteria, they were also checked through additional callbacks to respondents and discussion with the interviewer. Table 39 shows the breakdown of excluded interviews by target group. 51 The lowest percentile of the average time per variable. The average time spent per variable is calculated as a ratio of IntLength and the total number of variables answered by the respondent (variable all_valuesT).

DATA PROTECTION Data protection measures were taken in line with the GDPR and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data. Respondents were informed of their rights as data subjects in the privacy notice form and had to give consent to participate in the survey. Participation in the survey was on a completely voluntary basis, and eligibility for the survey was based only on self-identification. Respondents were able to request the deletion of data until a few weeks after the end of the fieldwork in the country. After that date, which was given in the privacy notice, the NSE were responsible for deleting and destroying all the respondents\u2019 personal data, such as name, telephone or addresses, which were kept if available during fieldwork to administer back-checks. The local fieldwork agencies had to fill in and sign data destruction protocols, which were shared with FRA. Data files were transferred through a safe data share system. ",
        "82 This chapter provides an overview of the overall weighting procedures applied to data and the weighting efficiency achieved across countries. Weighting adjusts the statistics produced in accordance with the sample selection process, and corrects for potential deficiencies due to non-response. The weighting included several weight types, which were calculated respecting the differences between target groups and depending on sample designs. The three weights that were calculated are: \u2015 design weights \u2015 non-response weights and \u2015 post-stratification or calibration weights. The weighting procedures sometimes resulted in large variations between weights. Large weights can result in substantial losses in sample efficiency, so it is common practice to trim weights. Weights were therefore trimmed at several stages during the weight construction process. Since the distribution of weights in this survey was skewed towards lower values, the trimming was applied only to larger values. 8.1. DESIGN WEIGHTS Design weights are used to equalise differential selection probabilities arising from the sample design. In the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019, random probability sampling methods were used in three countries/target groups (France, the Netherlands (Traveller and Sinti population) and the United Kingdom), so that is where design weights were applied. The sample design for these three groups included the following three stages (for more information see Chapter 4): \u2015 selection of sampling units (PSUs and SSUs), using a two-stage approach; \u2015 selection of addresses/households; and \u2015 selection of one or two individuals to participate in the interview. The product of the probabilities calculated at each stage provided the overall probability of inclusion for each case in the sample, and the overall design weights were calculated as the inverse of this probability. Design weights were not calculated for the non-probability samples, even though it would have been possible to calculate them for the stage of sampling units\u2019 selection. However, it would not have been possible to calculate design weights for the second stage of selection (the selection of households) in the non- probability samples, meaning the weights would not have reflected the full design; therefore, the target groups with non-random (quota) sampling design approach were considered self-weighting in terms of the design, and adjustments were made at later stages of weighting, to correct for any regional or demographic imbalances against the population profiles. 8. WEIGHTING ",
        "83 8.1.1. Sampling unit selection weight The sampling units were selected in a two-stage process for all three countries/ target groups using random probability sampling methods. The units were selected with PPS. The sampling unit selection probability, p PSU1 , was calculated as follows: p PSU1 = n PSU * size i /\u2211size i * n ssui * size j /\u2211size j where: n PSU = number of PSUs sampled size i = size of PSU i n SSUi = number of SSUs sampled in the i th PSU size j = size of SSU j The sampling unit selection weight DW PSU1 was calculated as the inverse of its probability, p PSU1 : DW PSU1 = 1/ p PSU1 8.1.2. Addresses selection weight Within each sampling unit in the three countries/target groups using random probability sampling methods, addresses (households) were selected randomly either from the list or by random walk. Addresses had different selection probabilities across sampling units, given the sampling units were of different sizes, and the numbers of addresses selected were designed to deliver similar numbers of interviews in each sampling unit. The probability of selection of each address (conditional on selection of its sampling unit) was: p unit1 = n unit1 / N unit1 where: n unit1 = number of addresses selected and used in the sampling unit (i.e. the number visited, whether interviewed or not). N unit1 = total number of addresses/households in the sampling unit. This figure was counted or estimated by the interviewer/mediator during the first visit to the sampling unit. The address selection weight DW unit1 was calculated as the inverse of its probability, p unit1 : DW unit1 = 1/ p unit1 The samples were designed to be self-weighting up to this stage. That is, the product of the sampling unit selection weight and address selection weight was supposed to give similar weights across cases. Using the number of addresses found in the field ( N unit1 ) as the denominator in the address selection probability calculation meant this combined weight would vary. In effect, it corrected for inaccuracies in the sampling frame in terms of the number of the target population households expected in each sampling unit. 8.1.3. Individual respondent selection weight The survey protocols permitted one respondent to be selected per household in France, and up to two respondents per household in the Netherlands and ",
        "84 the United Kingdom. The selection was random in France, while a non-random selection was permitted in the other two countries, when the random selection was refused. The method of selection was recorded in the data. However, the same adjustment was used irrespective of the approach, in order to give individuals equal weighting irrespective of the selection method. This meant that equal treatment was given to both types of approaches at the design stage. The alternative, not applying a respondent selection weight where the respondent selection was non-random, would be equivalent to treating each of these households as single-person households. This would result in them receiving a larger weight than randomly selected individuals in households of two or more persons, and therefore a greater share in the weighted data. Hence, this was not considered an acceptable approach. The probability of a respondent being selected (conditional on selection of their household) was: p ind = n ind / N ind where: n ind = number of individuals selected (1 or 2) N ind = total number of eligible individuals in the household The individual respondent selection weight DW ind was calculated as the inverse of its probability, p ind : DW ind = 1/ p ind The overall design weight (W dw ) was the product of each of the weights that were required for the applicable sample design: W dw1 = DW PSU1 * DW unit1 * DW ind The full address selection weight (sampling unit and address unit selection weights combined, DW PSU * DW unit ) was trimmed when the ratio of the largest to the smallest weight was greater than 10, at maximum 95th percentile of the distribution. This was the case in the United Kingdom, while in France and the Netherlands trimming the 99th percentile was applied, since the ratio of the largest to the smallest weight could be brought under 10 with less trimming. The individual selection weight, DW ind , was trimmed when the ratio was above 5. In accordance with this rule, the trimming was applied only in France, at the 99th percentile. This was not necessary for the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as the selection of two individuals per household was allowed. This meant that the probabilities of selection were higher, and hence the variation in weights lower. The maximum weight was 2.5 in the Netherlands and 4.5 in the United Kingdom. 8.1.4. Alternative design weights The random probability samples were designed to be self-weighting up to the address selection stage \u2013 that is, the product of the sampling unit selection weight and address selection weight was supposed to give similar weights across cases. However, as the sampling frame information proved to be inaccurate in many cases, the resulting weights had greater variation. Namely, the population sizes across SSUs identified during the mapping stage often differed from the sizes expected in the PSU sample frame. Then, the sizes identified during fieldwork sometimes differed from the expected ",
        "85 SSU sizes. Even using population figures corrected for inaccuracies on the sampling frame, it did lead to large variations in weights. In an attempt to decrease the variation, two alternative options for calculating the sampling unit and addressing selection weights were considered. The first option assumed only PSU selection probabilities ( p PSU2 = n PSU * size i /\u2211size i ) when calculating the sampling unit selection weight (DW PSU2 = 1/ p PSU2 ), and consequently used the number of addresses selected in the PSU ( n unit2 ) and the total number of addresses found in the PSU ( N unit2 ) when calculating probabilities of address selection ( p unit2 = n unit2 / N unit2 ) and the address selection weight (DW unit2 = 1/ p unit2 ). The second alternative option also assumed only PSU selection probabilities ( p PSU2 = n PSU * size i /\u2211size i ) when calculating the sampling unit selection weight (DW PSU2 = 1/ p PSU2 ), and then used the number of addresses selected in the PSU ( n unit2 ) and the PSU size ( N unit3 = size i ) when calculating probabilities of address selection ( p unit3 = n unit2 / N unit3 ) and the address selection weight (DW unit3 = 1/ p unit3 ). The alternative versions of the overall design weight were then calculated: W dw2 = DW PSU2 * DW unit2 * DW ind W dw3 = DW PSU2 * DW unit3 * DW ind The next stages of weighting also included all three (the original and two alternative) options, and three versions of the final weight were consequently calculated. The second design weight option (W dw2 ) proved to have the lowest variation across all three random probability samples, and it was hence decided to use this option as the final version of the design weight (W dw ). 8.2. NON-RESPONSE WEIGHTS Non-response weights were applied to all samples in order to reduce the non-response bias by adjusting the interview sample to the gross sample on the basis of information available from the sampling frames about the units in the gross sample. Non-response weights are effective to the extent that (a) the weighting variables chosen correlate with sample members\u2019 likelihood of responding, (b) they correlate with key survey variables and (c) key survey variables take the same mean values for respondents and non-respondents within weighting cells. Conditions (a) and (b) can be tested empirically on survey data whereas condition (c) cannot. The survey collected data on the age, gender, main activity and education level of each household member in responding households. This information was used to derive the profile of all eligible household members in these households (the gross household member sample) and use it for the non- response weighting. Logistic regression was used to fit a model with response to the survey as the dependent (binary) variable, after applying the overall design weight (W dw ). The non-response weight, W nr , was calculated as the reciprocal of the probability of response generated by the model. When the selection of individual(s) to participate in the survey was made at random, it was expected that the interview profile and gross profile would be similar on the available variables. Slight deviations were noticed in France, and the non-response weight was used to correct this. In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the selection was not always made at random, and both random and non-random methods were used in the same samples. In these samples the adjustment was made to align the interview and gross ",
        "86 household member samples, to reduce bias caused by the non-random selection of individuals. The approach was not different for households where two respondents were interviewed. Each of these individuals was a part of the interviewed sample, which was adjusted to the gross sample of all individuals in the households. The adjustment was made for the full samples in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, including both randomly and non-randomly selected respondents, in order to maximise the sample size and the stability of the adjustment. As households were not selected randomly for the non-probability quota samples, these household samples could not be considered unbiased. Therefore, it cannot be claimed that the gross household member sample would provide reliable information on the target population profiles. However, there was value in reviewing the gross household member profiles against the interview profiles, and applying the non-response weighting for these samples; hence, the adjustments described above were made for the non- random samples, too. The within-household non-response weight, W nr , was trimmed when the ratio between the smallest and largest weights was greater than 10. This was necessary for Belgium (Roma) 52 , France and the United Kingdom, where trimming at the 99th percentile was applied. 8.3. POST-STRATIFICATION WEIGHT In order to ensure that the samples accurately reflect the structure of the target populations, a post-stratification or calibration weighting procedure was carried out on a country-by-country basis. This was applied to all types of samples. These weighting adjustments depend on reliable population data covering the survey population. Since the target groups represent small proportions of the overall country populations, sociodemographic profile data about the population were generally limited to Ireland and the United Kingdom where the census captures Roma and Traveller backgrounds. However, even in these countries the census is not believed to capture the total target population. Moreover, in some countries the survey did not cover the full target group population in the country, meaning any profile data that could be found were likely to cover a slightly different population. For these reasons the main variables considered for post-stratification weighting were those found in the survey sampling frames, specifically region and urbanisation (where available 53 ). The sampling frames also provided information on estimated target population sizes, which could be used for weighting to the gross population. If there was a good reason to believe that the sampling frame counts were inaccurate, then other options were considered. This was the case in France, as explained in Chapter 4, where the weighting profiles were based on the population covered only, and there was no attempt to use the weighting to correct for coverage. This approach is advised, since weights are not able to correct for gaps in the sample where there are no similar cases that can be used to represent those that are missing. Post-stratification or calibration weights were calculated using a suitable approach, either rim weighting (raking) or cell weighting. Rim weighting 52 The variation of non-response weights for Roma in Belgium was high because the proportion of non-response to the education questions was higher for household members than for the individuals interviewed. 53 DEGURBA was not available in the sample frames for France and the United Kingdom. ",
        "87 was used for France, as population profiles by region and urbanity were only available independently. In all other countries the two variables were interlocked 54 , so cell weighting could be used. The final weight was trimmed when the ratio between the smallest and largest weights was greater than 15, at maximum 90th percentile of the distribution. For Belgium (Caravan dwellers 55 and Roma) trimming was done at the 98th and 99th percentiles, respectively. For the Netherlands (Roma), trimming was done at the 98.5th percentile, while France, the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti) and the United Kingdom were trimmed at the 90th percentile. 8.4. FINAL RESPONDENT WEIGHT AND ITS GROSSING OR SCALING Initial final individual weights were calculated as the product of design weights (where applicable), non-response weights and post-stratification/calibration weights. In the final weighting stage, the weights were then grossed to the population size in each country, as this means that a single weight can be used to provide weighted estimates for within-country or between-country analyses. Total populations were taken from the sampling frames, based on the populations covered. The sample frames for Belgium (Roma), Ireland, the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden provided the sizes of the total target populations (individuals of all ages). The sample frames for Belgium (Caravan dwellers), France, the Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti) and the United Kingdom provided the total number of households. The average household sizes reported in the data (after the final weights) were applied for calculating the total target population size, i.e. population of individuals of all ages. In Belgium and the Netherlands, two different target groups were covered by the survey. These groups were sampled independently, and their respective weights reflect the designs implemented. The weighted samples are hence representative for each group. Grossing the weights to the total target population meant that the proportions of groups within the country are properly represented. Hence, the final weights can be considered representative of both groups combined within the country, and can be used for reporting at country level. Given the differences in the population sizes of the groups covered in Belgium and the Netherlands relative to their sample sizes 56 , grossing the weights meant that different mean values of the final weights were obtained for these groups 57 . This consequently meant that the ratio of the minimum to the maximum value of the weight within a country was higher than ratios within samples for each group. The trimming was not applied at country level, 54 Only region was available for the United Kingdom. 55 Only two interviews were completed in the Walloon Region, while, based on the information available in the sample frame, 11 % of the covered population was expected to live there. This caused the use of a wide range of post- stratification coefficients; however, trimming the final weight at the 98th percentile decreased the ratio of the minimum to the maximum weight to below 15. 56 The sample of 124 Caravan dwellers in Belgium represented 2 471 persons, while the sample of 482 Roma represented 28 375 persons. The sample of 511 Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands represented 16 665 persons, while the sample of 201 Roma represented 16 159 persons. 57 The average value of the final weight is 19.9 for Caravan dwellers, and 58.9 for Roma in Belgium. In the Netherlands, the average value of the final weight is 32.6 for Travellers and Sinti, and 80.4 for Roma. ",
        "88 as it would contradict the goal of grossing the samples, i.e. representing the population sizes of each group covered by the survey. 8.5. HOUSEHOLD WEIGHT Another weight was produced for reporting at the level of all household members. The household weight was derived from the final weights for respondents, described in the previous sections. In households with one respondent the weight was calculated by dividing the final respondent weight by the household size, while in households with two respondents the sum of the final weights for both respondents was divided by the household size. In this way the weighted population sizes for the respondent sample and for the household member sample are the same. 8.6. WEIGHTING EFFICIENCY Table 40 provides the range and ratio (largest to smallest) of the final weights 58 for each country and target group (standardised to a mean of 1 for each sample). It also provides the weighting efficiency of the samples. This was calculated as the ratio of the effective sample size to total sample size. The effective sample size was calculated using the standard Kish formula (sum of weights squared divided by sum of squared weights). The efficiencies therefore do not take account of the impact of clustering or stratification. 58 As described in Section 8.1.4, the second design weight option (Wdw2) was used for constructing the final weight.

        "89 The quality assurance plan (QAP I for stage 1 of the project up until and including the pilot, QAP II for stage 2 after the pilot survey; see Annex 12.2) for the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 provided detailed targets for monitoring quality across the pilot and the main stage of the project. Providing monthly reports with the revised risk status helped in identifying where remedial measures would be required. This chapter, however, now looks more closely at the quality of the data collected along five quality dimensions: relevance; accuracy and reliability; timeliness and punctuality; coherence and comparability; accessibility and clarity. For the most part, the details of the survey and its outcomes that are discussed in this chapter have also been described in earlier chapters of this report, but the presentation of the information in this chapter follows the specific dimensions of survey quality, as indicated by the headings used below. 9.1. RELEVANCE Roma and Travellers have a long history of experiencing discrimination, persecution and exclusion in Europe 59 . \u2018Roma are still being deprived of their basic human rights in Europe\u2019 as the European Parliament underlined in its 2019 resolution on the post-2020 Strategic EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the fight against antigypsyism 60 . In 2013, the European Parliament urged Member States \u2018to produce disaggregated data with the assistance of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and to develop, in cooperation with the Commission, the baseline indicators and measurable targets that are essential for a robust monitoring system in order to ensure reliable feedback on the progress made in the implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategies and in improvement of the situation of Roma\u2019 61 . A first step in monitoring progress was made in 2015\u20132016 with the completion of the second wave of EU-MIDIS survey, which collected data on Roma in the nine EU Member States with the largest Roma populations. The objective of the Survey on the Rights and Living Conditions of Roma and Travellers 2018\u20132019 was to collect representative data on the situation of Roma and Travellers in six countries with smaller Roma populations, which have (with the exception of France) previously not been covered in a multinational comparative survey. In conjunction with the results of the upcoming Roma Survey 2020 the two surveys will provide the baseline indicators for the evaluation of the national Roma inclusion strategies at the end of the 2020s. 59 Council of Europe (n.d.), Roma history factsheets . 60 European Parliament (2019), Resolution on the need for a strengthened post-2020 Strategic EU Framework for National Roma Inclusion Strategies and stepping up the fight against anti-Gypsyism, 2019/2509(RSP) , 6 February 2019, recital B. 61 European Parliament (2013), Resolution on the progress made in the implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategies 2013/2924(RSP), 12 December 2013, recital 12. 9. SURVEY QUALITY ASSESSMENT ",
        "90 In order to ensure the relevance of the data, and of the project as such, to the national Roma communities, efforts were made to include their views in all stages of the project. By involving national community stakeholders and experts in the background research, the target populations were defined and approached, the questionnaire adapted and translations tailored to the communities\u2019 needs. Community interviewers and mediators were involved in the data collection, and stakeholders and experts were consulted on the interpretation of the results. 9.2. ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY This section elaborates on the definition of the target groups for the purposes of the survey, the different sample designs, and an analysis of the sampling error and the standard deviation. The assessment of the accuracy and reliability of the data covers the following types of errors that occur in statistical surveys: \u2015 coverage and sample frame errors; \u2015 non-sampling errors: \u00cb productivity of sampling points, \u00cb unit non-response, \u00cb biases due to under-/overcoverage; \u2015 measurement errors (from the questionnaire, data collection method, interviewer or respondent); \u2015 processing errors (in data cleaning and weighting). Given the lack of statistical data on the Roma and Traveller populations in the survey countries, survey design decisions had to be taken and revised in an iterative process of assessing the available data and expert consultations throughout the project. The background research and stakeholder consultations at the beginning of the project were needed to provide the solid basis for all of the following steps and decisions. Definition of the target groups for the purposes of the survey The full-scale survey did not explicitly cover all target groups identified during the background research in France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Recently arrived or \u2018new\u2019 Roma were included only in Belgium, while they were excluded from the survey\u2019s target population in France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In France, the indigenous Roma were also excluded. In addition, the Traveller/Caravan dweller population was reduced to those living in halting sites, in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Those living outside official halting sites or in bricks-and-mortar housing (such as regular houses/ apartments) were not included in the survey 62 . Respondents were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older, self-identified as being Roma or Traveller, and had lived in a private household within the survey country for at least six months of the 12 months prior to the interview. Sample design In all countries and survey groups, the PSUs were selected randomly or fully covered. For Travellers in France, Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands, and Roma and Travellers in the United Kingdom, the available data on halting sites and the higher level of concentration in certain areas of the targeted Roma and Traveller groups allowed random probability household and respondent selection. In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the sample design 62 It was not possible to obtain a sampling frame for these target groups and they do not live in high concentrations or designated areas throughout the countries. Quota sampling might have been possible but of lower quality than the random sampling approach for a restricted target group. ",
        "91 eventually provided for interviewers to opt for non-random within-household selection of respondents if random selection was refused, and allowed up to two interviews per household in order to meet the target number of interviews. In all other groups, non-random (quota) selection was laid down at household and respondent levels given the lack of available data on the target population, and their geographical dispersion throughout the country and municipalities. 9.2.1. Sampling errors All sample surveys are affected by sampling error, given that the survey interviews only a fraction of the total population. Therefore, all results presented are point estimates with underlying statistical variation. Small differences of a few percentage points between groups of respondents have to be interpreted with caution because there may not be a statistically meaningful difference between the groups compared. Only more substantial differences between population groups should be considered actual differences in the total population. Results based on small sample sizes are statistically less reliable and are flagged in figures and tables (for example by putting the results considered less reliable in brackets in the figures) and not interpreted substantially. These include statistics that are based on samples of between 20 and 49 respondents in total; this could be the case, for example, when analysing the results for a specific category of respondents based on their sociodemographic characteristics, or when analysing a question that only a small set of respondents was asked to answer. Results based on fewer than 20 respondents are not shown. Results based on cell sizes with fewer than 20 persons are flagged as well. Table 41 provides an overview of confidence intervals for selected indicators of the survey. The confidence intervals reflect the uncertainty in the estimates due to sampling and are mainly influenced by the sampling design and the sample size. The commonly used 95 % confidence intervals are shown. This means that, if the sampling were to be carried out repeatedly, in the long run 95 % of the intervals in the repeated samples would contain the true value in the population. The confidence intervals were calculated using two methods. In the cases of Travellers in France, Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands, and Gypsies and Travellers in the United Kingdom, the confidence intervals were computed in a standard manner taking into account the clustering and survey design. These intervals provide a general indication of uncertainty based on the sample size. However, for quota sampling \u2013 which was carried out for Roma and Travellers in Belgium, Travellers in Ireland, Roma in the Netherlands, and Roma and Travellers in Sweden \u2013 the theory of statistical inference using confidence intervals does not apply. To compute indicative confidence intervals a replication method (bootstrap repeated sampling) was used. This approach is expected to provide a good estimate of the sampling variability if the observed sample is representative of what would be observed in repeated samples using the same design. The confidence intervals calculated for groups with quota sampling are only suggestive. The lengths of these confidence intervals are not comparable to the lengths of the confidence intervals for the groups with random sampling. The length of intervals may differ between the two methods because for random sampling the confidence intervals are based on the probability theory. In contrast, the confidence intervals for quota sampling groups are based only on the actual data observed within the sample. ",
        "92 Albeit the description of the sampling stages in the report has been assessed as accurate and clear by external consultants, the sampling and weighting experts from the University of Siena made suggestions for a different kind of sampling for future surveys. In their view, there is insufficient detailed knowledge of sampling frames and the distribution of the reference population by several indicators required for quota sampling and probability sampling. Thus, they suggested using other sampling methods for elusive populations, such the ones described by Vijay Verma 63 . A sampling methodology such as respondent-driven sampling could be, in their opinion, well suited for collecting data on Roma and Travellers. However, the experiences gained during the fieldwork showed that Roma and Travellers are (to varying degrees between countries) not very willing and open to disclose information and are distrustful of the survey. This could make respondent-driven sampling impossible, since the method depends on people recommending others to take part in the survey. 9.2.2. Non-sampling errors Coverage and sample frame errors Within the abovementioned limitations to the target groups within each country, the coverage (among the sample frame population data) included 100 % of the population in Belgium and France, 99 % in Sweden, 97 % of Roma in the Netherlands and 93 % of Travellers in Ireland. Among Travellers and Sinti in the Netherlands, and Roma and Travellers in the United Kingdom, the coverage was 74 % and 84 %, respectively. There were some (larger) discrepancies found between the initial population size estimates made during the background research and the estimates made when building the sample frame (and doing the mapping) in all countries. 63 V.

        "93 The coverage of the final sample, based on the sample frame information, is around 100 % of the initially estimated population size among Roma in Belgium (95 %) and Travellers in Ireland (96 %); in Sweden it is 86 %. The population covered based on the sample frame is larger than originally estimated among Caravan dwellers in Belgium (107 %) and among Roma in the Netherlands (124 %). Productivity of sampling points The productivity of sampling points (for the random selection countries) was lowest in the United Kingdom (64 % fully completed, 12 % partially completed), which means that almost one in five sampling points (i.e. halting sites) were determined to be empty, not populated, non-residential or destroyed. The interviewers were denied access to 6 % of the halting sites. In France, the share of (partially) productive halting sites is 91 % (87 % fully productive, 4 % partially productive) of all sites in the sample. The rest of the sites were either empty (3 %) or considered dangerous (2 %), or the interviewers were denied access to them (4 %). Among the Traveller sites in the Netherlands no issues were reported and all could be accessed. For countries which used a quota sampling approach, sampling points could be unproductive if it was not possible to recruit respondents in these locations and no contact was established (\u2018access denied\u2019). This was the case for 12 % of the sampling points (where cooperation could be established) for Caravan dwellers in Belgium, 15 % for Travellers in Ireland and 19 % for Roma and Travellers in Sweden. All other sampling points were at least partially productive for all target groups. Unit non-response The response rate (based at household level and only for target groups where a random probability approach was used) is 46 % in France, 51 % in the United Kingdom and 57 % in the Netherlands (Travellers). The eligibility rates are more than 90 %. For the groups with non-probability sampling, no meaningful response rates can be calculated. Biases due to under-/overcoverage Given the lack of any official statistics regarding the target population in most countries and strong reliance on various experts and community representatives to build the information on which to base the sampling designs in the majority of cases, it is very difficult to detect biases in the data, and it is also not possible to be conclusive about what impact any potential biases in the unweighted samples achieved have on the data quality. For the detection of biases by age and gender, the analysis had to rely on the comparison between the age and gender profile of the interviewed sample and that of all adult household members as reported in the survey data. Sizeable undercoverages were observed in Belgium due to the low number of interviews among Roma and Travellers in the Wallonia Region and in South- West Ireland. A gender bias with an undercoverage of men occurred in the United Kingdom. This was due to underreporting of men, which was predicted by the experts consulted before the field phase. In almost all countries, small and remote locations were excluded from the sample. Table 42 also indicates whether or not the targeted number of interviews was achieved or any other biases occurred for each survey group. The fieldwork period was initially planned to be during the winter months. Background research showed that some of the sites would not be occupied during winter. ",

        "95 9.2.3. Measurement errors Measurement errors can occur in multiple areas: (1) when looking at the design, content, phrasing, etc. of the questionnaire, (2) when developing the data collection method (training of the interviewers, mediators, etc.), (3) during the interview, caused by the interviewer (e.g. through influencing), or (4) during the interview, caused by the respondent, through misunderstanding some questions, lack of command of language, low literacy levels or low levels of interest, etc. The questionnaire of the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 was not fundamentally changed from EU-MIDIS II, but still underwent extensive technical pretesting and was also tested in the field during a pilot study and adapted afterwards. The translation process was extensive, using the adapted TRAPD method and certified pre-existing translations, and local agencies were consulted on the wording of the questions and answer categories. The data collection was done using CAPI, which minimises some data entry errors by the interviewers (by routing or plausibility checks during the data entry, e.g. for open fields). CAPI furthermore eliminates data entry errors, since this is done electronically. The interviewers selected for the survey were highly experienced (except for the community interviewers), well trained and guided by means of a field manual, and in constant contact with the local agencies. In addition, the local agencies were required to carry out back- checks by phone or postcards to validate the interviews. FRA also conducted fieldwork observations in France, Ireland, Netherlands (Travellers and Sinti), Sweden and the United Kingdom. The order of some answer categories on show cards was randomised in order to minimise mode effects. The interviewers were asked to provide an assessment of the interview situation and the respondents at the end of each interview. In general, respondents were interested in the topics of the questionnaire and cooperated well, even though the questionnaire was perceived as repetitive and too long. A low literacy level was common across all target groups, and some terms or concepts were not well understood. Some topics were sensitive for respondents and they were reluctant to answer. The majority of interviewers felt that respondents were cooperative and that they were being honest in their answers. Overall the majority of respondents were willing and able to complete the survey alone. This suggests that interviewers were able to build trust with the respondents and that they had the facilities to accommodate this. In all countries, except for the Netherlands (Roma), there were instances when a mediator, halting site manager or supervisor was present during the interview. Target group Regional distribution Gender/age distribution Other potential issues observed UK Gypsies and Travellers Variations in the regional distribution, because of high numbers of unproductive sites (due to closure/destruction, rather than denial of access), variable numbers of second interviews and non-response in different areas\ufffd No systematic undercoverage by region due to sample design suspected\ufffd Discrepancies were corrected for during weighing\ufffd Slight overrepresentation of rural areas due to higher productivity than urban and suburban areas, in contrast to the selected sample profile Gender and age bias, with young men in particular underrepresented, corrected for during weighting using the profile of all adult household members\ufffd However, there seems to be a general issue with underreporting of men by (female) respondents in the United Kingdom, resulting in a manifest underrepresentation of men in the weighted UK sample Sample frame included 24 633 caravans; estimations were between 27 600 and 60 000 people\ufffd Limitation of sample frame to England and Wales (no lists available for Scotland and Northern Ireland)\ufffd Local authorities with fewer than 50 caravans were excluded, resulting in coverage of 84 % of the sample frame population\ufffd Only two thirds of the sites could be identified in the field; there is no information on the other third ",
        "96 Item non-response INR was more likely if respondents did not fully trust how their answers would be used, considered it a social taboo to talk about the topic, did not understand the question/terms/concepts, or did not know the answer (for example, someone living with their parents was less likely to know the monthly net income of the household). 54 interviews had INR equal to or more than 25 %, with the highest values among Roma in the Netherlands and Travellers in France (6 % and 2 % of the sample, respectively). INR was also used as a criterion for the elimination of cases. At respondent level, only 1 % of the respondents have more than 10 % INR across the (numeric items of the) questionnaire. No valid interview had more than 20 % INR. Sensitive topics such as income and health show higher shares of INR. INR for the questions on income was above 40 % in France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. INR for health-related questions was above 40 % for Roma in the Netherlands. Very high proportions of INR were observed for the question on the hours worked per week (25 %) and the question concerning the person(s)/ organisation(s) to whom/which victims of discrimination reported the incident or made the complaint (20 %). The questions on trust in institutions such as the European Parliament (19 %), the national parliament (12 %), national politicians and the national legal system (both 9 %) also produced more INR than most other questions in the survey. A total of 16 % of the respondents did not answer the question asking if they were aware of an anti-discrimination law in the survey country. Questions on arrears in payments such as debts, loan, utility bills and rent were also less well understood and/or less often answered (14 % to 8 % non-response per item). Furthermore, it seemed more difficult for respondents (10 % or more INR) to answer questions on the ethnic background (other than Roma) of the perpetrators of incidents of harassment and violence. In Belgium and the Netherlands, the question on the expected level of education also produced quite high percentages of INR (18 % and 13 %, respectively). The years spent in education and the year of arrival in the country were also difficult to answer for all groups and resulted in INR for 12 % and 8 % of the respondents, respectively. Furthermore, 12 % did not specify the type of official who asked or expected a bribe from them, 11 % could or would not indicate if they did not have a washing machine because they could not afford it, and 7 % did not indicate when they had last felt discriminated against at work. The question on discrimination experiences while trying to rent or buy accommodation was not answered by 6 % of the respondents; for the assessment of police stops regarding ethnic profiling, INR added up to 6 %; and for the question about whether or not they think that there are enough places for travellers in the country it was 6 % as well. The rest of the questions produced 5 % or less of INR. 9.2.4. Processing errors Data cleaning and plausibility Two main criteria are specified for excluding interviews: \u2015 very high INR, for a high number of question refusals or \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 answers; \u2015 very short interviews, where it seems unrealistic that it is possible to read out questions in such a short time. ",
        "97 Interviews with high INR are excluded. Given the challenges of the survey (high illiteracy rate, etc.), and after reviewing the qualitative information, only those with INR of 45 % or above are excluded from the data set. Across all countries and target groups, the average interview length overall (excluding outliers and implausible interviews) was 42 minutes, while the median was 38 minutes. The median ranges between 30 and 34 minutes in Ireland and the Netherlands, and between 47 and 49 in Sweden and Belgium (Roma). Interviews with an average time spent per variable of less than 4.34 seconds were also excluded from the final data set. This corresponds to the lowest percentile of the average time per variable. In total, 55 interviews were excluded: 48 because of short interview lengths; 7 because of high INR. The highest number of excluded interviews was in Ireland (23 interviews \u2013 18 excluded because of short interview lengths, 5 because of high INR) and among Travellers in the Netherlands (17 because of short interview lengths). In the other survey groups only five or fewer interviews were excluded. Checks on duplicates or near-duplicates did not detect any obvious fraud. The checks on outliers, unusual patterns or responses that could be indicative of interviewer error or implausible answers resulted in consultations with the local field teams, but no edits were made to the data file following these checks. Checks between the PSU and ECS data were successfully performed for all target groups. They only proved to be problematic for France, since the PSU contact sheets contained records for each caravan site in the sampling points. This produced contradicting information within one PSU/SSU. Owing to the higher levels of missing data on income and the importance of having information on household income for calculating social inclusion indicators, missing data for the exact household income have been imputed. The full imputation was only done for survey groups with fewer than 30 % of values missing in the income question in the data set (Roma and Travellers in Belgium and Sweden). Fully imputed data normally should not affect the data distribution significantly; however, taking into account the high number of missing cases, for this survey some changes in the data distribution needed to be accepted. Weighting accuracy The sample frames in France, the Netherlands (Traveller and Sinti) and the United Kingdom were designed to be self-weighting; however, the final samples were in fact far from that. Firstly, the population identified in the mapped locations (SSUs) often did not correspond to the numbers expected based on the PSU information. Secondly, once the SSUs were visited, the numbers of Traveller households identified were often different from what was expected based on the mapping information. Finally, in France and the United Kingdom conducting a full census of addresses in SSUs where the sampling interval was between 1 and 2 meant that the addresses were selected with unequal probabilities. These eventually led to large variations in the design weights, and alternative weighting options were introduced in order to decrease these variations. No population data that would allow use of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, main activity and level of education in post-stratification weighting were available for most of the groups covered. Hence, the sample profile needed to be adjusted by means of within-household non-response weighting. For the random probability samples, the households were selected randomly, and the profile of household members could be considered representative. This was not the case for the non-probability quota samples, ",
        "98 of which it cannot be claimed that the gross household member sample provides reliable information on the target population profile. However, an assumption was made that the gross household sample profile was still a better reflection of the population than the interview profile, and hence the non-response adjustments were made for the non-random samples as well. The post-stratification weighting step relied on the sample frame information. The PSU sample frame information was considered reliable in all countries except France, where the SSU sample frame information had to be used for the calibration weighting. Since the sample frame in the United Kingdom was available at a larger territorial level, it was not possible to derive the population targets based on DEGURBA and to use it for the post-stratification weighting. This was, however, possible in France, since the mapping of sites (units for which DEGURBA could be determined) was done for almost the entire country, and the population targets could be derived. It was possible to obtain this information for all other countries as well. Deriving DEGURBA in the United Kingdom would be possible in future surveys only if the mapping of sites were completed for all local authorities in the country. The large variations of the design weights, although controlled by using an alternative option for the weights, still led to the final weights being less efficient in the random selection countries. The weighting efficiency for the non-random quota samples was higher in Ireland, the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden, but not for Belgium owing to the adaptations of the sample during fieldwork. The description of the weights provided in Chapter 7 was deemed accurate and clear by the external sampling and weighting experts. For future surveys, they recommend constructing a unique weight from the beginning for the countries where, in this survey, a separate weight has been implemented for each of the two subpopulations (Belgium and the Netherlands). 9.3. TIMELINESS AND PUNCTUALITY The project was commissioned in December 2017 with a view to delivering all outputs within 21 months of the contract signature date. In the face of various challenges encountered during the fieldwork period, in early June 2019 a contract extension for one more month until 14 October 2019 was agreed to allow more time for interviews to be conducted. The data were collected between December 2018 and July 2019, which was somewhat longer than originally planned. Following the internal quality assurance plan, there were some delays caused by the extended pilot and finalising the sampling approach, which had knock-on effects on the time available to finalise the materials and conduct the fieldwork. When fieldwork proved challenging, a further extension to the fieldwork period was required. The timetable was updated to provide achievable dates for deliverables, and the deliverables were submitted within these revised deadlines. FRA published the main results report of the survey in the second half of 2020. The results of the survey were published in time for the development of the Communication of the European Commission as a \u2018portfolio of indicators\u2019 on the strategic EU framework for Roma equality, inclusion and participation. 9.4. COHERENCE AND COMPARABILITY The developed main source questionnaire follows mostly the EU-MIDIS II questionnaire with a few exceptions (changes after pilot, etc.), but it also ",
        "99 included new questions. The translation processes following the adapted TRAPD method ensure comparability across all six survey countries as well as the validity of the translations. Comparability issues could occur based on the different sampling methods employed. However, because of the elusive populations and the lack of data on the survey\u2019s target population in the survey countries, the sampling methods employed in this project were considered more or less without alternative. Since there are no comparative administrative data sources on this population available and no extensive research has been done in the survey countries, it is not possible to assess the coherence of the data. The questionnaire design and DP of selected concepts and indicators calculated within the scope of the project allow for partial and full comparability with the indicators available for the general population. \u2015 Full comparability was achieved for the concepts of material deprivation, housing deprivation, overcrowding, health-related activity limitations (Global Activity Limitation Indicator) and subjective health assessment. \u2015 Partial comparability of indicators calculated within the scope of the project was achieved for the following concepts. \u00cb The paid work rate in the Roma and Travellers Survey is based on the questions \u2018Please look at this card and tell me which of these categories describes your current situation best?\u2019 (HH04) and \u2018Did you do any work in the last 4 weeks to earn some money?\u2019 (HH24). The Eurostat employment rate is based on the International Labour Organization concept: persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or profit for at least 1 hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent. \u00cb NEET (not in education, employment or training): the Roma and Travellers Survey NEET rate is based on the paid work rate (see above) and excludes non-formal activities, whereas the Eurostat NEET rate is based on the International Labour Organization employment rate and includes non-formal education or training. \u00cb Early school leavers: the Roma and Travellers Survey concept is based on the highest level of education achieved and main activity status (without specifying the 4 weeks preceding the survey and excluding non-formal education or training). Eurostat includes persons who were not in education and training (neither formal nor non-formal) in the 4 weeks preceding the Labour Force Survey. \u00cb Early childhood education: the respondent answered the survey question taking into consideration all children in the household and indicated if they regularly attend public or private childcare (including nursery, preschool, etc.). Age is calculated on an annual basis, so the figures do not consider an individual child\u2019s early or delayed start to primary education, which limits comparability with EU-SILC data. \u00cb At-risk-of-poverty rate: the Roma and Travellers Survey counts all persons with an equivalised current monthly disposable household income below one twelfth of the national at-risk-of-poverty threshold 2018 (published by Eurostat). The equivalised disposable income is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions, divided by the number of household members converted into equalised adults, using the modified Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalence scale (1\u20130.5\u20130.3). By contrast, the Eurostat indicator provides information about annual household incomes. This might result in an overestimation of the at-risk-of-poverty rate in comparison with the general population. ",
        "100 \u00cb Life expectancy of Roma and Travellers is based on indirect estimation with the orphanhood method based on survey information on maternal and paternal survival, i.e. whether respondents\u2019 mothers and fathers were still alive at the time of the survey (see Luy, Marc, 2009 and 2010) 64 . The estimates refer to the forecast trend of 2016 (latest available data for the general population); the total is weighted based on the survey group totals and sample sizes. Low case numbers are problematic and require the application of specific inclusion criteria, which are to some extent arbitrary, and estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. Possible differences in infant and child mortality between Roma and Travellers and the general population are not taken into account, which could potentially underestimate the difference in life expectancy between Roma and Travellers and the general population in the current estimates. More details can be found in the Section 3 in the Annex of this report. 9.5. ACCESSIBILITY AND CLARITY FRA plans to disseminate the results in multiple written and visual formats. The main report was published in the second half of 2020. In addition, relevant country results will be published in the form of country briefs. Headline and secondary indicators, which were developed in cooperation with the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers and the Roma Working Party, are published in conjunction with the Communication of the European Commission as a \u2018portfolio of indicators\u2019 on the strategic EU framework for Roma equality, inclusion and participation. The data will be made available on the FRA website through the data explorer, and anonymised microdata will be archived and made available for researchers. The questionnaire, data collection process and data themselves are documented in detail, including the published questionnaire 65 , this technical report and the codebook (made available along with the microdata file). 64 Luy, M.

        "101 This chapter uses the experience and knowledge gained from working on the survey to draw important lessons for conducting future surveys among Roma and Travellers, including the most appropriate sampling and interviewing methods. The chapter also highlights any difficulties that research projects focusing on hard-to-reach groups may face. 10.1. BACKGROUND RESEARCH, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION AND PILOT SURVEY The background research, stakeholder consultation and pilot survey were necessary stages to undertake in order to inform the final survey and sampling design. However, given that much was unknown about surveying Roma and Travellers in the selected countries, it would have been beneficial if a feasibility study (or a more extensive pilot survey) consisting of these phases had been conducted separately, giving each more time. 10.2. DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSLATION OF QUESTIONNAIRE AND FIELDWORK MATERIALS A collaborative approach was taken to the development of the materials, and good use was made of the various documents that had been previously used for EU-MIDIS II. There was a relatively small number of questions (or rather words in questions) that required double translation, and the majority of those items needing double translation had to follow the conventions of the previously used translations from EU-MIDIS II and EU-SILC. As a result, following the entire adapted TRAPD approach was not always necessary. \u2015 The importance of allocating sufficient time to the questionnaire development phase and a systematic approach to the checking of the scripts cannot be emphasised enough. Specific attention should be paid to the visual presentation of questions (formatting, layout, etc.) prior to the translation and scripting of the language versions. \u2015 Feedback from the NSEs and interviewers about the questionnaire, the supporting materials and contact sheets raised certain issues such as the following. \u00cb The length and repetitiveness (similar questions for each of the domains of potential discrimination) of the questionnaire had already been raised as an issue in EU-MIDIS II, and in consequence the questionnaire for the Roma and Travellers Survey was shortened and adapted to avoid such repetitiveness. Nevertheless, it was an issue that came up during the interviews. \u00cb Shared language versions (languages used in more than one country) need to be adapted, particularly when working with minority audiences that have specific language requirements, and language and terminology need to be simplified. \u00cb Further involvement of community members should be sought for the identification and rephrasing of sensitive questions. For example, 10. LESSONS LEARNED ",
        "102 household finances and facilities produced high levels of INR, even though the interviewer training specifically addressed these issues, and even though these questions worked better in some countries than in others. \u00cb The amount of paperwork (introductory letter, privacy notice and postcard) should be reduced, keeping the introductory video for future surveys, maybe posting it on web-based or social media. \u00cb Electronic versions of contact sheets are preferable and recommended. \u00cb Less experienced interviewers, however, need more training on how to fill in the contact sheets with the device. \u2015 The PSU contact sheet should be adapted to be able to capture more than one halting site (such as in France) within a PSU or SSU in future surveys, to be able to process paradata at halting site or location level. Contact sheets at the level of the location/site could be a solution and would also reduce the amount of information collected at PSU level. 10.3. INTERVIEWER SELECTION AND TRAINING While the feedback from the training sessions for the interviewers was generally positive and essential, interviewer briefings should be brought closer to the start of the fieldwork if this is delayed. The interviewer manual (deemed useful overall) needs to be further shortened. Roma and Traveller interviewers are vital for securing access to respondents and building trust (in particular in Ireland and the Netherlands) and it is recommended to use them in future surveys as well. However, they can be expected to have less interviewing experience than professional interviewers, and resources should be allocated for additional, tailored training with a particular focus on practical sessions and data quality procedures. If it is not possible to use community interviewers, there are clear benefits to using mediators from the community in a survey such as this. The mediators can open up networks, spread a positive word about the survey and connect the local teams with respondents. It also helps with reassuring the respondents about the objectives of the survey. In addition, it is beneficial for interviewers, who can learn from the mediators about the community, making them better prepared for the interviews. It is therefore recommended to use mediators in future waves of the Roma and Travellers Survey, ensuring, however, sufficient resources to recruit and manage the mediators\u2019 limited time resources. It would also be advisable in future to spend more time explaining to mediators why it is important for interviews to be conducted in privacy. The number of interviews per interviewer was limited at the beginning of the project. However, owing to limited interviewer availability and issues with the interviewers in accessing or connecting with the communities, the maximum number of interviews per interviewer was exceeded in most countries. While tighter control of the number of interviews conducted by interviewer is needed in the future, it is recommended to relax this rule to some degree and rather control for potential bias introduced by interviewers. While the use of incentives in these countries did not appear to have a detrimental effect on fieldwork, it did not appear to be key to securing participation, either. It is therefore recommended that experts be consulted in the future to advise on whether or not incentives are necessary or appropriate. ",
        "103 10.4. SAMPLING AND FIELDWORK Sample frames for most of the groups covered by this survey were not readily available, and constructing them was resource intensive. Still, the population data collected were not always reliable, and revisions to the frames and sample designs needed to be made in later stages of the project. Sufficient time and budget resources should be planned for implementing the (random) sampling approaches in future surveys. In any country where it is necessary to map specific sites where the target population live in high concentrations, sufficient time should be allowed for this process. At the same time, collecting details for specific sites needs to happen shortly before the fieldwork starts, so that the most accurate population numbers are recorded. One way of organising this could be through issuing the sample iteratively, as soon as all the sites for a certain area (selected in the first stage) are mapped. This, however, would require a longer period for fieldwork implementation. For France, unless an alternative reliable source of data at department level becomes available, it is recommended for any future surveys with Travellers (Gens du voyage) to conduct mapping of all halting sites in the country before the sample selection. It is also recommended that identification numbers should be assigned at location/site level, not SSU level, in order to link DEGURBA or other characteristics to the sites, not the whole sampling unit. In Ireland, Traveller representatives should be involved in the process of constructing PSUs, so that the Electoral Divisions can be combined in a way that suits their organisational structure (in larger territorial units following the health board regions). Moreover, they would be able to provide useful information on whether or not the population numbers in certain areas have changed since the last update of the sample frame, and possibly on the predominant type of accommodation of Travellers in some areas. For future surveys, it cannot be expected that larger sample sizes can be reached for either of the target groups in Belgium, or for Sweden (assuming the same sampling methodologies). Including more local authorities in the sample for the United Kingdom could potentially result in completing more interviews there; however, increasing the sample size requires adding a larger number of local authorities with smaller population sizes. The random probability approach, even with random selection of respondents (while allocating more budget and expecting lower response rates in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) are deemed possible in future surveys in France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands (Traveller and Sinti). Future surveys could also consider implementing a random probability approach in Ireland. This seemed to be feasible in the pilot survey; however, testing this approach again with a larger sample size is recommended before a final decision is made. The implementation of fieldwork and the sampling methodologies required extensive involvement of the support organisations and mediators, making the local teams reliant on the willingness of these organisations to cooperate. Ongoing and close liaison with the support organisations and mediators should be accounted for in the planning of future waves of the survey, as they proved necessary to successfully implement the chosen sampling methods. Allowing a longer fieldwork period would enable the fieldwork to be implemented in phases, with more time to reflect on the outcomes, and changes due to necessary country-based revisions to be introduced in a systematic way. However, this could also be challenging in terms of interviewer engagement, if the work is not continuously distributed throughout the fieldwork period and does not leave breaks between phases. ",
        "104 The planned winter schedule for the fieldwork limited the possibility of reaching full coverage and some of the halting sites. Despite the prolongation of the fieldwork it was not possible to adapt the samples ex post to include the halting sites previously classified as empty. Recommendations on the ideal fieldwork period were mixed, as summer time and holiday periods can create barriers to reaching out effectively to halting sites. The full census applied when selecting addresses in the majority of sampling units in France and the United Kingdom (66 % and 95 %) effectively meant that addresses were selected with unequal probabilities, which consequently introduced higher variation in design weights. Maintaining equal probabilities when selecting addresses, by issuing the same number of addresses per sampling unit, could be considered for future surveys. However, this would require a random selection of the starting points in each sampling unit, so that each address in a sampling unit has an equal chance of being selected. Standard back-checking processes by phone were not successful with these target groups because of the reluctance of respondents of marginalised communities to provide contact details. Alternative measures put in place in the Netherlands (Roma) and Sweden did not produce any reliable results, so further investigations and additional training of interviewers in reassuring respondents are recommended. 10.5. DATA PROCESSING Codebooks should receive more attention earlier in the project cycle in terms of how answers will be presented in the data files. In particular, it should be thoroughly considered which paradata to collect and how to convey them in the data files. It is also recommended to consider thoroughly, already at design stage, which information besides the questionnaire answers should be included in the data sets and how the data should be represented in the different data files (e.g. by household member, household, address, sampling point). A flagging variable indicating suspicious cases should be included in the data set from the beginning, and it should be agreed before the start of fieldwork which cases to flag. It is further recommended to use numeric IDs for sampling points and interviewers across all documents and coordination points (FRA, the CCT and local agencies) to facilitate communication and administration as well as the matching of different files. Data-related issues, questions and solutions were documented in a data quality control log, which should be kept for future surveys. The data files were sent at pre-specified dates, rather than once a specific percentage of the target sample size was reached (e.g. 10 %, 30 %, 50 %). The latter is recommended for future surveys. 10.6. QUALITY ASSURANCE Internally, the quality assurance plan (QAP I for stage 1, until the pilot survey, and QAP II for stage 2, after the pilot) for the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 was comprehensive and provided detailed targets for monitoring quality across the two (pilot and main) stages of the project. It would have been preferable to have one overarching quality assurance and monitoring plan to cover the entirety of the survey. ",
        "105 10.7. TIMETABLE Overall, the timetable for the Roma and Travellers Survey 2019 proved to be challenging at times. Although only a 1-month extension was required overall, there were periods that were very busy and required extraordinary efforts by all parties in order to limit the delays or keep on track with the timetable. It is recommended to not start the fieldwork shortly before Christmas, or in winter in general, given that daylight hours are reduced, potentially affecting interviewers\u2019 ability to visit certain areas or sites and the likelihood of Traveller sites being occupied.

TESTING AND MEASURING LIFE EXPECTANCY OF ROMA AND TRAVELLERS 67 3.1. Introduction Several studies suggest that the population of Roma and Travellers is severely disadvantaged in health compared with the non-Roma population and faces a range of barriers in accessing healthcare 68 . According to the most widely cited and generally accepted data from the Council of Europe, the life expectancy (LE) of this subgroup is between 10 and 15 years lower than that of the general population. However, all existing reports about levels and trends of Roma and Travellers\u2019 LE are substantially limited in the comprehensiveness and quality of the available data. As a consequence, it is not clear if the disadvantage in the number of life years is actually that high. The aim of the present work was therefore to provide additional estimates derived by a different approach and for subpopulations of Roma and Travellers for which no such estimates exist so far. For this purpose, FRA included particular questions in the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey that allow the application of a specific indirect approach to estimate LE on the basis of proportions of still living mothers and fathers, known as the orphanhood method (OM) 69 . The data turned out to be a reliable basis for applying the OM. Indirect techniques are different approaches of demographic tools for estimating LE of populations that lack population statistics, typically applied in less developed countries where conventional demographic data are either 67 This work was commissioned under contract with Dr Marc Luy, Austrian Academy of Sciences, to test and develop an estimator for life expectancy. The goal is to provide timely and accurate information. If errors are brought to our attention, we will try to correct them. However, the European Agency for Fundamental Rights accepts no responsibility or liability with regard to the information in the following part of this document. 68 E.g. D. Bogdanovi\u0107, D.

        "115 non-existent or too deficient to be usable 70 . In rare cases, these methods have also been applied to analyse mortality in developed populations when the required data were not available from population registers. The basic strategy of indirect estimation techniques is to reconstruct a time series of survivorship estimates and thus to analyse time trends in LE from survey information on the proportion of respondents of different ages with still living children (own children method), parents (orphanhood method), siblings (sibling survival technique) or spouses (spouse survival technique). The OM is seen to be the most promising and therefore the most frequently used of these approaches because the survival status of respondents\u2019 parents can be expected to be reported more adequately than the survival status of other family members 71 . For this reason, the OM approach was used to estimate LE for Roma and Travellers in Belgium, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, given that no register data are available to estimate life tables for this subpopulation with the standard direct techniques. 3.2. Orphanhood method The basic idea of the OM is that the age of respondents represents the survival time of the mother/father. Consequently, the proportion of respondents of a given age whose mother (or father) is still alive approximates a survivorship ratio from the average age at childbearing to that age plus the age of the respondents 72 . The OM converts the proportions of those with a surviving parent into life table survivorship probabilities for predefined adult ages by controlling for the prevailing pattern of childbearing 73 . These survivorship probabilities are then used to derive a complete survival function for estimating LE without having a set of age-specific death rates on which the classic life tables are based. Three approaches have been developed for converting proportions of still living parents into life table survivorship probabilities from the information of one survey 74 . All three conversion methods require the same input data: 70 D. Bradshaw and I. M. Tim\u00e6us (2006), \u2018Levels and trends of adult mortality\u2019, in D. T. Jamison, R. G. Feachem, M. W.

Luy (2010a), \u2018A classification of the nature of mortality data underlying the estimates for the 2004 and 2006 United Nations\u2019 World Population Prospects\u2019, Comparative Population Studies \u2013 Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungswissenschaft , Vol. 35, No 2, pp. 315\u2013334; United Nations (2006), World Population Prospects: The 2004 revision , Vol. III, Analytical report, New York, United Nations. 71 Bradshaw and Tim\u00e6us (2006); United Nations (2006). 72 For instance, if one surveys a hundred 30-year-old people and asks them if their mother (or father) is still alive, one receives the information that, for example, 90 % of the mothers (or fathers) have survived until the time of the interview. Let us assume that the average age at childbirth of respondents\u2019 mothers (or fathers), i.e. the age they were when the respondents were born, was 25 years; then one can interpret the 90 % still living mothers (or fathers) at the time of the survey as the survivorship ratio from age 25 (= average age at childbirth) to age 55 (= average age at childbirth plus age of respondents). 73 Methodological descriptions can be found in, for example, K. Hill (2006), \u2018Indirect estimation methods\u2019, in G. Caselli, J. Vallin and G. Wunsch (eds), Demography: Analysis and synthesis , Vol. IV, London, Academic Press, pp. 619\u2013 631; K.

        "116 (i) proportion of respondents with still living mother/father by 5-year age groups of respondents and (ii) estimates of the average age at childbirth of respondents\u2019 mothers/fathers for the same age groups of respondents. For this report the modified orphanhood method (MOM; Luy, 2009) approach was used to estimate the LE of Roma and Travellers because of its empirical (instead of theoretical) basis of transformation parameters and its proven functionality according to a comparison of MOM estimates with data from life tables for the total Italian population 75 . Moreover, the MOM tools also include parameters for estimating the age at childbirth of all parents based on information on still living parents (as available in in the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey)and for the estimation of reference periods on the basis of the empirical data mentioned. The MOM was developed to provide estimates for LE at age 30. The subsequent sections demonstrate in more detail the functionality and application of the MOM and how the estimates of LE at age 30 were used to estimate LE at birth too for Roma and Travellers. 3.3. Data and methods Basic information and completeness of data Table 54 shows the data of the total 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey sample on which the estimates of LE are based; the corresponding tables for the national subpopulations can be found at the end of this annex (see Tables 59\u201364). Separated figures by sex of respondents revealed no systematic differences in reporting between women and men. The completeness of information on parents\u2019 current survival status is high, being 98.9 % for mothers and 98.0 % for fathers. The proportion of respondents stating the current age of their still living parents is also relatively high for mothers (95.6 %), but somewhat lower for fathers (84.5 %). All analyses were based on cases with valid information only. Because proportions of respondents aged 65 and older with still living parents are too low to apply the MOM, the age groups 65\u201369 and 70+ were excluded from the analyses. 75 M. Luy (2012), \u2018Estimating mortality differences in developed countries from survey information on maternal and paternal orphanhood\u2019, Demography , Vol. 49, No 2, pp. 607\u2013627. ",
        "117 Assessment of data quality The suitability of the data for applying the MOM (see Table 55) was tested by descriptive analysis of the central information from the survey, i.e. the reported percentages of mothers and fathers alive and the ages of respondents\u2019 parents at the time of respondents\u2019 birth. The latter were estimated from the average ages of respondents by 5-year age groups and the reported average ages of still living parents, by subtracting the former from the latter (see Table 54).

TABLE 55: ASSESSMENT OF DATA SUITABILITY Criteria used Assessment Because mortality increases with age, the proportion of still living parents should decrease as the age of respondents rises In Figure 2, the overall trends reflect the expected decrease by age of respondents, with two known exceptions: lower reported proportions of still alive parents for the youngest age group and the levelling off of the decline in proportions of still living parents between respondents aged 55\u201359 and 60\u201364 ( A ) Because mortality of men is generally higher than female mortality and because fathers are usually some years older than mothers, the proportion of still living mothers should exceed those of fathers in all age groups of respondents Figure 2 shows that the proportions of still living mothers are higher than those of still living fathers in all age groups of respondents\ufffd Estimates can be based on data for 5-year age groups of respondents for both fathers and mothers Expectations regarding the average age at childbirth of respondents\u2019 parents are not as clear, but according to the observed trends around the world the age at childbirth of respondents\u2019 parents can be expected either to stay approximately constant or to decrease as the age of respondents\u2019 parents rises, i\ufffde\ufffd to be lower for older respondents For mothers and fathers the data are in line with the assumptions for respondents until age 54\ufffd The changes in the average age of childbirth for respondents in the age groups 55\u201359 and 60\u201364 do not fit into the picture\ufffd Therefore, the usability of estimates derived from the age groups 55\u201359 and 60\u201364 has to be assessed in the light of the estimated time trend in LE for both sexes\ufffd This is the only way to evaluate whether the apparently irregular ages at childbirth lead to plausible or implausible estimates in combination with the stated proportions of respondents with deceased mothers and fathers Fathers should have a higher average age at childbirth than mothers in all age groups of respondents The exception is the age group 55\u201359\ufffd Hence, this and the age group 60\u201364 need specific assessment A Closer analysis of these phenomena does not identify direct problems with the data, but suggests that the analysis should start with information from respondents aged 20\u201324 (Luy, 2012). ",
        "118 The restriction of the analyses to respondents aged 20\u201364 reduced the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey sample to 3 701 respondents. The completeness of information on parents\u2019 actual survival status is similar to that of the total sample, being 98.9 % for mothers and 98.2 % for fathers. The proportions of respondents stating the actual age of their still living parents decreased slightly to 95.5 % for mothers and to 83.6 % for fathers. Naturally, the age patterns of respondents with still living parents and the parents\u2019 ages at childbirth are more variable in the national subsamples than in the total sample because of the lower case numbers (see Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). The same assessments as described above were carried out for each of the national subsamples to decide which age groups can be used for the estimation of LE with the MOM. Two additional inclusion criteria were used: \u2015 the number of still living and deceased parents must be five or more; \u2015 the age patterns of proportions with mother/father alive and the parents\u2019 ages at childbirth must agree with the plausibility criteria described. In cases where these criteria were not fulfilled, visual inspections of estimated LE values were carried out, and those age groups were excluded that biased the LE trend depicted by the estimates derived from the age groups fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Estimation of life expectancy The estimation of LE for Roma and Travellers on the basis of information on the survival of respondents\u2019 parents required the following analytical steps: 1. estimation of the average age at childbirth of all respondents\u2019 parents ( M n *) based on the available information for still living parents only, for each age group n of respondents, with n = 20 for age group 20\u201324, n = 25 for age group 25\u201329, \u2026 , and n = 60 for age group 60\u201364; 2. estimation of respondents\u2019 mothers and fathers\u2019 survival probability from age 30 to 33 + n ( l 33+n / l 30 ) for each age group of respondents; FIGURE 2: REPORTED PROPORTIONS OF STILL LIVING PARENTS BY AGE OF RESPONDENTS AND ESTIMATED AGE AT CHILDBIRTH OF STILL LIVING PARENTS BY AGE OF RESPONDENTS (a) Proportion of parents alive (b) Estimated age of parents at childbirth 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 16-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 P r o p o r t i o n o f s t i l l l i v i n g p a r e n t s Age of respondents Mothers Fathers 0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 16-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 L i v i n g p a r e n t s ' a g e a t c h i l d b i r t h Age of respondents Mothers Fathers Source: Own calculations based on data from the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey ",

The results of steps 1\u20136 are summarised in Table 56 for women and men separately. Steps 1\u20133 were carried out with the MOM estimation tools provided by Luy 76 . These tools include, for each step of the calculations, sets of parameters that can be applied directly to the data of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey. The life tables for Roma and Travellers in step 4 were derived from predefined standard life tables with the logit life table model 77 . The logit life table model is a tool to construct a complete life table through reshaping a predefined standard life table by varying two parameters, \u03b1 (level of mortality) and \u03b2 (age pattern of mortality) 78 . Because no information on the age pattern of mortality is available for Roma and Travellers, parameter \u03b2 was set to 1.0, thus assuming the mortality pattern to equal that of the total population. The parameter \u03b1 of the logit life table model was determined by the estimated survivorship probability for Roma and Travellers from step 2, with the life tables for the corresponding total populations as standard. For the total sample of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey, these standard life tables were constructed from the (unweighted) averaged probabilities of dying for single ages from 30 to 100 for the six countries in which the survey was conducted (the corresponding values for LE at age 30 for this reference population can be found in Table 56, column e 30 Ref.) 79 . For the national subpopulations of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey, the reference life tables were constructed from the age-specific probabilities of dying of the corresponding national populations. Figure 3 illustrates this decisive procedure for the estimation of LE for Roma and Travellers with the example of data for mothers from respondents 76 M. Luy (2010b), Estimating mortality differentials in developed populations from survey information on maternal and paternal orphanhood: Supplement , Vienna, Vienna Institute of Demography In particular, the MOM tool set developed on the basis of the Italian 2003 Multipurpose Survey (MPS) was used. Tests were also done with the tool set developed for MPS 1998, which differs only slightly from the version for 2003. The MPS 2003 tools were chosen because they refer to mortality and fertility conditions of cohorts closer to those of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey. Moreover, the final results differed slightly only for the estimates derived from data on respondents aged 50 and older, where the estimates derived with the MPS 2003 tools appeared more plausible, in particular for women. 77 W. Brass (1975), Methods for estimating fertility and mortality from limited and defective data , Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina. 78 The calculation formula of the logit life table model is logit lx = \u03b1 + \u03b2\u00b7logit lx(S), with lx(S) being the age-specific survival probabilities to age x of the standard life table and lx the age-specific survival probabilities of the estimated life table. 79 The probabilities of dying were calculated for each reference period determined in step 3 with data from the Human Mortality Database, University of California, Berkeley (USA), and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany), available at https://www.mortality.org or https://www.humanmortality.de . ",
        "120 aged 40\u201344. In step 2 the survival probability of these mothers from age 30 to age 73 was estimated to be 0.617, i.e. 61.7 % (orange dot at the end of the orange dashed line in Figure 3). In step 3 the reference period for this survivorship probability was estimated to be mid of the year 2004 (2004.6 precisely). The blue solid line in the graph represents the life table for the total reference population of this time. The survival probability from age 30 to age 73 of this life table is 0.829 (blue dot at the end of the blue dashed line in Figure 3), and the LE at age 30 derived from the survival function is 52.6 years (see Table 56). Estimating Brass\u2019s \u03b1 from the relation between the two survival probabilities from age 30 to age 73 for the standard population and Roma/Travellers and setting Brass\u2019s \u03b2 = 1.0 yields the orange solid life table for Roma and Travellers. In simple words, the logit life table model transfers the standard life table for the total population into a life table for Roma and Travellers by relating the empirically derived estimate for the survival probability of Roma and Travellers from age 30 to 73 to that of the standard population (indicated by the blue arrow in Figure 2) 80 . The resulting life tables for Roma and Travellers led to the estimates for LE at age 30 for each reference period (step 5; see Table 56, column e 30 Roma). Because parents have lower mortality than childless people 81, an additional adjustment to estimate LE for the total population of Roma and Travellers (step 6) was undertaken. This adjustment was done by applying the overestimation of total LE in orphanhood-based estimates for Italy, identified by Luy (2012), by reducing the estimated LE at age 30 for mothers by 1.5 years and those for fathers by 0.75 years (Table 56, column e 30 * Roma). In step 7, the resulting point estimates for e 30 Roma and e 30 * Roma were smoothed by linear regression modelling. These trends were used in the final step, 8, to estimate LE at birth for Roma and Travellers by applying the relative difference between e 30 of the total reference population and Roma/Travellers \u2013 i.e. e 30 * Roma divided by e 30 Ref. \u2013 to LE at birth for the reference population. 80 Therefore, the Brass model is also known as the \u2018relational\u2019 life table model.

        "122 The decision was taken to estimate LE at birth on the basis of e 30 *, which includes the additional adjustment for the total population (i.e. not only parents). An argument for using e 30 instead of the e 30 * estimates was the typical U-shaped pattern of mortality by parity, taking into account the fact that the average number of children of Roma and Travellers is reported to be higher than that of the total reference population 82 . Typically, mortality is lowest for women and men who have one or two children and then increases with the number of children. However, it is unknown to what extent this holds true for Roma and Travellers as well. Moreover, it can be assumed that Roma and Travellers have an even higher excess mortality in infancy and childhood, which would increase their relative disadvantage in LE at birth compared with their disadvantage in LE at age 30 83 . It was therefore concluded that an overestimate of Roma and Travellers\u2019 LE at birth based on the trends in e 30 is more likely than an underestimate based on trends in e 30 *. 3.4. Results The estimates of LE at 30 for the total sample of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey are illustrated in Figure 4 for women and men separately. The bold solid line shows the annual values for LE at age 30 for the reference population from 1990 to 2016 (the most recent available data in the Human Mortality Database). The reference population\u2019s LE increased more or less steadily from 50.5 to 54.2 years among women, and from 44.7 to 50.3 years among men. Estimates of LE at age 30 for all Roma and Travellers ( e 30 * Roma) are shown in dots for the estimated reference periods. The blue dots represent the estimates derived from data on respondents aged 20\u201324 to 50\u201354 (from right to left) and the orange dots those for respondents aged 55\u201359 and 60\u201364. These last two are highlighted because these age groups appeared as outliers in the descriptive analysis of percentages of respondents with mother/father alive and parents\u2019 age at childbearing (Section 3.3, Annex), and therefore require a particular plausibility check. All estimates of LE at age 30 for Roma and Travellers lie distinctly below the values for the reference population in both sexes. The differences range from 7.2 to 10.4 years among women, and from 8.3 to 10.1 years among men. The linear trends derived from the point estimates indicate that Roma and Travellers also experienced an increase in LE during the last decades (see dashed lines in Figure 4, in orange including the estimates derived from respondents aged 55\u201359 and 60\u201364, and in blue without these estimates). In fact, the trends suggest that the increase in LE was stronger than in the reference population. As a consequence, the extent of Roma and Travellers\u2019 disadvantage in LE decreased for both sexes, more quickly among women than men. Note, however, that the increase in LE of female Roma and Travellers according to the orange trend line in Figure 4 is most likely overestimated. According to this trend, LE of female Roma and Travellers at age 30 increased on average by 0.31 years per annum, whereas the value for the female reference population is 0.14 years. Excluding the orange point estimates from respondents aged 55\u201359 and 60\u201364, the annual LE increase among Roma and Travellers is 0.22 years. This value is more plausible given observed trends in LE in developed populations 84 . The corresponding annual increases among men are 0.22 years for the reference population and, based on the orange trend line including all point estimates, 82 European Commission (2014), Roma Health Report: Health status of the Roma population \u2013 Data collection in the Member States of the European Union , Brussels, European Union. 83 European Public Health Alliance (2018), Closing the life expectancy gap of Roma in Europe: Roma Health and Early Childhood Development Study , Brussels, European Public Health Alliance. 84 G.

Because the LE of men is known to have increased faster than the LE of women in all populations in developed countries since at least the early 1990s 85 it was decided to exclude the estimates from respondents aged 55\u201359 and 60\u201364 for the estimation of LE for the female population of Roma and Travellers, but to use the complete series of point estimates for the male population of Roma and Travellers. In this way, the estimates for Roma and Travellers are most in line with the general trends in LE of women and men across Europe. 85 F.

The estimates for LE at birth from 1990 to 2016 can be found in Table 57. Naturally, the differences between Roma/Travellers and the reference population are larger for LE at birth than for LE at age 30 (by 4.4 years for women and 5.5 years for men on average). The estimated disadvantage of Roma and Travellers compared with the reference population decreased from 14.8 years in 1990 to 11.6 years in 2016 among women, and from 15.6 years in 1990 to 13.5 years in 2016 among men. The average disadvantage across the overall time span was 13.2 years for women and 14.4 years for men.

        "127 Because the sum of the national samples differs from the total sample of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey,estimates for the total of countries, consistent with the country-specific estimates, were derived by averaging the national LE values for the reference populations as well as for Roma and Travellers, both weighted by the proportions of the national subsamples of Roma and Travellers in the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey on the basis of cases with valid information on survival status of parents (presented in two variants, labelled as EU-6 for the combination of all six country-specific estimates and EU-5 excluding the United Kingdom). Note that these values differ from those presented for the total of the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey sample not only because of the exclusion of the Roma subsample of the Netherlands, but also because of the different weighting of the country- specific values in the averages for the reference population. Table 58 gives the estimated LE at age 30 in 2016 \u2013 the most recent year for which estimations were possible \u2013 disaggregated by sex, for each of the national subsamples in comparison with the corresponding total populations. Among the female populations of Roma and Travellers, the estimated LE at age 30 ranges between 45.4 and 48.8 years, and among men between 49.6 and 51.3 years. All these values are distinctly lower than those for the corresponding total populations. The disadvantages of Roma and Travellers in LE at age 30 vary from 4.6 years for female Gypsies and Travellers in the United Kingdom to 8.9 years for male Roma and Caravan dwellers in Belgium. The differences in LE at age 30 between the reference populations and Roma and Travellers for all EU-6 countries combined are 6.3 years among women and 6.5 years among men. For the EU-5 countries the differences are 6.7 and 6.4 years, respectively.

        "128 Table 58 also summarises the corresponding estimates of LE at birth in 2016 (the estimates for each year from 1990 to 2016 can be found in Table 59 to Table 64). For the female national subpopulations of Roma and Travellers, the estimates for 2016 range between 70.1 and 75.7 years, and for the male national subpopulations of Roma and Travellers between 64.6 and 69.0 years. The differences from the total national populations are between 7.1 years for female Gypsies and Travellers in the United Kingdom and 14.2 years for male Roma and Caravan dwellers in Belgium. The differences in weighted averages are 9.8 years among women and 10.3 years among men for all EU-6 countries, and 10.3 years among women and 10.2 years among men for the EU-5 countries. These gaps in LE between Roma and Travellers and the general populations correspond to the existing estimates for earlier years, thus confirming the existence of an extraordinary disadvantage of Roma and Travellers in the total number of life years. 3.5. Summary and assessment of the estimation approach used Because no data on age-specific numbers of deaths and living population are available for this subpopulation, LE of Roma and Travellers in these six European countries could not be derived by the classic life table methodology on the basis of directly calculated age-specific death rates. Therefore, an alternative indirect approach to estimate LE on the basis of proportions of still living mothers and fathers was employed, the OM, which is based on information on the survival and age of respondents\u2019 parents. According to the estimates presented here, the extent of Roma\u2019s and Travellers\u2019 disadvantage varies between countries. For 2016, the estimated differences in LE at birth from the total national populations vary between 7.1 years for female Gypsies and Travellers in the United Kingdom and 14.2 years for male Roma and Caravan dwellers in Belgium. Although these figures fit well with previous reports and estimates of Roma and Travellers\u2019 mortality 86, the results must be interpreted with caution. Indirect methods such as the OM always entail several drawbacks (see, for example, Luy, 2012; Tim\u00e6us, 1991). Most importantly, they can provide only broad measures of the overall level of and trend in mortality and are inherently unable to detect short-term trends or abnormal age patterns of mortality, such as temporary decreases in LE or particular age ranges with excess mortality. A further limitation of the OM is that it yields estimates of mortality that refer to dates well before the survey was conducted. Deaths of parents occur over a period extending back to when respondents were born in the case of mothers and about nine months earlier for fathers. The younger the respondents, the more recent are the derived mortality estimates. But even the estimates based on respondents aged 20\u201324 refer to a period about 9 years prior to the survey. This problem may be overcome when two or more surveys containing the necessary information for the OM and spaced by approximately 5 or 10 years are available so that the cohort-change parental survival methods can be applied. Nonetheless, a particular problem of indirect estimation is that not all estimates derived from the different age groups provide meaningful results. This difficulty is mainly related to the low case numbers. This requires the application of specific inclusion criteria, which are to some extent arbitrary. Further potential problems of the OM are a possible adoption effect (respondents whose parents have died are likely to have been reared by 86 The results presented here confirm previous estimates for other countries regarding the extent of differences in LE between Roma/Travellers and the total national populations, and similar trends in increases in LE. Furthermore, they are in line with previous reports, which suggest smaller differences in LE between Roma/Travellers and the total national population in the United Kingdom than in other European countries.

        "129 another adult and may not even know that this person is not their biological parent), multi-reporting (the frequency of reporting about each parent depends on their number of surviving children and thus is connected to both mortality and fertility levels of the family), selection effects (regarding fathers and mothers if there is a relationship between parity and mortality, and regarding respondents if there is a relationship between parental and child mortality) and wrong age reports by the respondents. It is not clear, however, to what extent these issues apply likewise to the population of Roma and Travellers. Moreover, the biases caused by multi-reporting and various kinds of selection are to some extent mutually offsetting and thus considered to be small and rather unimportant, as demonstrated by Palloni et al. 87 . Another critical issue is the specific choice of theoretical fertility and mortality models underlying the traditional approaches to convert a proportion of non- orphaned respondents into life table estimates that do not necessarily reflect the real prevailing demographic conditions of the population studied 88 . To reduce this problem when the OM is applied to European (sub)populations, Luy (2009) developed the MOM, in which this conversion is based exclusively on empirical data for the Italian population. Although the fertility and mortality patterns of Roma and Travellers are likely to be different from those of the Italian population, the MOM approach used in this study seems more appropriate for application to the population of Roma and Travellers than the traditional OM approaches, which were developed to fit fertility and mortality patters expected to be prevailing in developing countries. Note that the European Commission (2014, p. 36) reports indications that \u2018the Roma population is mirroring the decline in birth rate that took place in the European non-Roma population several decades ago\u2019. Last but not least, it should be noted that the quality of estimates derived with the OM depends strongly on the quality of the underlying data. If the data are of low quality or not representative of the investigated population, the method cannot provide reliable or representative results. However, this problem applies to all kinds of empirical analyses and is not related to indirect estimation techniques in particular. On the other hand, the OM and other indirect methods have some advantages over direct methods for the analysis of survey data. First, they permit the deriving of life tables and thus the estimation of LE. Years of life represent the most easily understandable unit of measurement of mortality levels and differentials. Variations in more frequently used standardised death rates or relative risks are more difficult to assess because large differences in these measures do not necessarily reflect large differences in actual lifespan. In addition, a life table provides the possibility of also estimating the number of healthy life years if information about health is available. Second, indirect methods typically provide trends in demographic conditions that are derived from a single cross-sectional survey, whereas direct methods usually provide only one estimate from cross-sectional data for a specific year. A third advantage is that the information used is based on respondents\u2019 lifetime experience and, thus, fairly precise estimates of the proportions of respondents with living parents (or other relatives) can be obtained even from surveys of moderate size. Knowing the general functionality of this 87 A. Palloni, M. Massagli and J. Marcotte (1984), \u2018Estimating adult mortality with maternal orphanhood data: analysis of sensitivity of the techniques\u2019, Population Studies , Vol. 38, No 2, pp. 255\u2013279. 88 K.

        "130 method, information on interesting aspects of mortality can be collected quite easily and at moderate cost by including a few simple questions in existing or planned survey programmes. Finally, it should be kept in mind that indirect estimation is primarily an alternative to having no information. It cannot be \u2013 and it is not supposed to be \u2013 an alternative to estimates based on vital registration data or census data linked to subsequent deaths with high matching rates. The most apt formulation of indirect techniques\u2019 characteristics and the potentials they offer is by Hill (2006, p. 631): \u2018Indirect estimation procedures \u2026 remain important as ways of producing estimates for small population subgroups and for tracking trends. \u2026 Purists sometimes find this indirectness distressing, whereas pragmatists accept what they can get.\u2019 With regard to the estimation of LE of Roma and Travellers, the conclusion was drawn that this indirect estimation approach can be applied successfully and provides meaningful results. Therefore, the use of indirect methods helps to fill an important knowledge gap regarding the health of Roma and Travellers. The reported data in the 2019 Roma and Travellers Survey turned out to be a reliable basis for applying the MOM for most of the subsamples and most age groups. Moreover, the completeness of the data was very high (i.e. almost no cases with missing information). The problems that led to the exclusion of some age groups and further subgroups of the national subsamples are most likely due to the low case numbers and different response rates for information on the survival status of respondents\u2019 parents and their actual ages. Because the latter information refers to still living parents only, the different response rates are natural. This is no problem as long as the case numbers are large enough which they were not for the exceptions mentioned. ",
