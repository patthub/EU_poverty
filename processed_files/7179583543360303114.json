        "- 1 - INTRODUCTION In total 13 programmes are established in Sweden, of which there are 9 ERDF programmes, 1 EAFRD programme, 1 EMFF programme, 1 ESF programme, and 1 multi-fund programme based on ERDF and ESF funding. In total 3,602,209,484 Euro is allocated to ESIF, of which 774,349,654 Euro is allocated to ESF1, plus 44,163,096 for YEI. The ESF contributions amount to approximately 21.4% of the total EU funding foreseen. With this the country does not fully comply with the request that Member States that the share of the ESF as a percentage of total combined resources for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund at Union level in Member States is not less than 23.,1%. The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the ESF implementation approach in Sweden in the period 2014-2020. It analyses the strategic orientation (relationship between EU 2020 targets and country challenges), the strategic choices of the country in the ESIF framework (selection of thematic objectives/ investment priorities), the financial allocation (concentration on Thematic Objective level and relative share of total Cohesion Policy spending) and the Intervention Logic and result definition (relationship between Investment Priorities, specific objectives, activities, and output and result indicators). The Country factsheets are drawn up based on information extracted from an online database that was developed for the purpose of this study. This database stores quantitative and qualitative information from the 28 Partnership Agreements (PA) and all 184 ESF (mono and multi-fund) Operational Programmes (OP) across the 28 Member States (excluding three Technical Assistance Operational Programmes in France, Greece and Spain). Quantitative information mostly refers to financial allocation to OPs and Investment Priorities (always considering EU funding), target and baseline values of indicators; while qualitative/descriptive information refers to text entries (either extracted directly from the OP such as for the description of specific objectives, actions and target groups , or in the form of justification of assessment scores). All qualitative information in the database was standardised according common categories, called \u201cID categories\u201d , allowing aggregation of data at the country and EU 28 level. Information was collected (and also categorised according pre-defined ID categories) on the following features of each PA and OP: \uf0b7 Issues/challenges as expressed in the CSR and CPP (qualitative information; 17 standard categories); \uf0b7 Investment Priorities (19 standard categories) 2 ; \uf0b7 Specific Objectives (qualitative information; 27 standard categories); \uf0b7 Actions (qualitative information; 24 standard categories) \uf0b7 Target groups (qualitative information; 15 standards categories); \uf0b7 Result indicators (titles; 15 standard categories) \uf0b7 Output indicators (titles; 17 standards categories) \uf0b7 Methodology for target setting (qualitative information; 4 standard categories) Next to this factual information from PA and OP, this study also included a normative assessment on how each of the above elements corresponds and forms a coherent 1 These figures are reported in the Partnership Agreement. 2 regardless of its allocation to one or more Priority Axes within the same OP ",

In order to ensure a homogeneous and transparent assessment across different MS and OPs, ordinal (likert) scales have been developed for categorising and \u201cranking\u201d various types of assessments of the intervention logic of the OP (from \u201cnot at all\u201d, \u201clittle\u201d, \u201csomewhat\u201d, to \u201cvery\u201d coherent). Every assessment score made by the expert was accompanied by a descriptive entry justifying the attributed score, allowing consistency checks across all assessments made. All the above categories and definitions are presented in Annex 1. The database was completed by Country experts on the basis of a note providing step by step guidance on the data to be collected (including reference to specific sections/tables of the OPs, and categories of information). Country experts received ad hoc support by the Core Team during the data entering phase (including answers to Frequently Asked Questions). Database entries were further quality checked by the Core Team on the basis of the justifications provided by Country experts and following an iterative process of fine-tuning and standardisation of information. In the Annex to this report a methodological note is included providing information on how data for this report have been gathered and allocated to common categories and the criteria upon which assessments have been made on the external and internal coherence of the Operational Programmes. 1. SUMMARY Main challenges and how these are addressed by the Partnership agreement The challenges identified in the Country Specific Recommendations and the Country Position Paper are cohesively addressed in the Partnership Agreement. The main challenges presented are based on the low labour market participation of vulnerable groups, specifically non-EU nationals and low-educated young people. There is a specific reasoning where the recommendations in the CSR are widely considered in the PA. Altogether, there is very good alignment between the CPP, the CSR and the PA. External coherence of the ESF related OPs There are two OPs in Sweden, one mono- (ESF) and one multi-fund (CLLD). The challenges in the CSR and the CPP are primarily addressed by the regular ESF OP and investment priorities 8i, 8ii, and 9i. This constitutes the major part of the allocated funds. IP 8i has a general ambition to fund actions for long-term unemployed, and 8ii is specifically oriented towards young people. IP 10iv makes up for a smaller part of ESF actions (app. 2,5% of the ESF allocation) and is directed towards efforts to ",
        "- 3 - improve the transition from school to the labour market, especially of low-skilled young people and people with a migrant background. IP 10iii focuses on upgrading the knowledge, skills and competences of the workforce, mainly already employed persons, to avoid risks for later unemployment (app. 23% of the ESF allocation). Allocation and concentration of budget A total of \u20ac 741.609.618,00of ESF budget is available for Sweden, excluding 32 Meuro allocated for Technical Support. The focus of the ESF programme in Sweden is to a high extent concentrated on the need to increase the labour market participation of vulnerable groups. This is expressed in the large proportion of funds allocated for IPs 8i, 8iii, and 9i. The budget allocation for social inclusion, as defined by actions covered by all IPs that belong to TO9, amounts to 154.5 Meuro. This constitutes approximately 20,84% of the total national ESF budget. The budget is allocated on a selected number of IPs as the total budget allocated is distributed over the five largest investment priorities. Intervention logic and internal coherence Within Sweden, a total of six IPs are selected. The primary focus of the Swedish ESF OP is on increasing labour market participation and the three IPs that receive the major budget allocation of the OP have Specific Objectives directed at increased levels of employment at individual level. To achieve this objective, the Swedish ESF OP adopts an individual integrative approach. ESF actions are used to reinforce and develop regular labour market policy by making possible action over separate policy fields. There is generally good coherence between actions and Specific Objectives. There are 26 results indicators relating to Specific Objectives in Sweden. 24 indicators relate to actions under the ESF OP and two under the CLLD OP. The indicators are generally coherent with specific objectives and the policy interventions supported. They represent the specific objective and capture the changes foreseen. Programme performance There is a limited number of output indicators are used, and they are not specified separately for men and women. Typically, one output indicator is dedicated for one IP, and they show that, even if the ESF programme is primarily dedicated to support for unemployed individuals, the majority of the participants are employed individuals. This is because actions for unemployed get more funding per participant than the actions for employed individuals. Among unemployed individuals, output indicators show that focus to a large extent is on unemployed young people. None of the results indicators information is specified for men and women, i.e. no specific targets have been set for women and men respectively, but this will be reported according to requirements. Special themes Low labour market participation for young is a crucial challenge in Sweden and the Youth Employment Initiative is activated in the Swedish ESF OP. Actions for unemployed young is a central part if the Swedish OP. YEI is treated as a separate Priority Axis in the Swedish ESF OP, which is allocated 44 Meuro in ESF funding. This constitutes approximately 10% of the ESF programme in Sweden. YEI is sorted under IP 8ii and treated as a part of actions directed towards young people. ",

        "- 5 - 3. COHERENCE BETWEEN CHALLENGES AND SELECTED ESF INVESTMENT PRIORITIES IN SWEDEN 3.1 Challenges for Sweden Overall Sweden is well on track in relation to the Europe 2020 targets. All national targets are expected to be reached or have already been reached. The challenge that is most relevant for Swedish conditions is to raise the employment rate of the population aged 20-64. This has also a recurring theme of the Country Specific Recommendations over the last years. Table 2 EU2020 Headline targets Europe 2020 ESF headline targets Baseline value in Sweden (as reported in PA) National 2020 target in the NRP 75% of the population aged 20-64 should be employed 79,8% (2013) 80% Reducing early school leaving to less than 10% 7,5% (2012) 10% At least 40% of 30-34 years old completing tertiary or equivalent education 47,9% (2012) 42,5% Reducing the number of people in or at risk of poverty or exclusion by at least 20 million 12,7% (2013) 14% The Country Specific Recommendations and the Commission Position Paper address challenges that are relevant for TO8, TO9 and TO10. An overview on the main challenges identified in these strategic documents, clustered by thematic objective, is provided below. Regarding TO8: \uf0b7 Need for labour market and education measures towards low-educated young people \uf0b7 Outreach to young people who are not registered with the public services. \uf0b7 Low labour market participation of vulnerable groups, specifically non-EU nationals \uf0b7 Low labour market participation and disadvantaged position of young people Regarding TO9: \uf0b7 Need for labour market and education actions towards persons with a migrant background Regarding TO10: \uf0b7 Problems with transition from education to the labour market \uf0b7 Risks that older persons have to leave the workforce early because of skills shortage Altogether, there is very good alignment between the CPP, the CSR and the PA. The PA refers to the challenges in the CPP and the CSR, and in the structuring of the ESF OP there is a close connection to the CPP and the CSR. 3.2 Coherence of ESF programmes to challenges addressed ",

This, reflecting the central position of the challenges, constitutes the major part of the allocated funds. IP 8i has a general ambition to fund actions for long-term unemployed, and 8ii is specifically oriented towards young people. In the multi-fund OP, ESF oriented actions are contained in IP 9vi and directed towards increasing the employability and adaptability of employed workers in urban and rural areas. IP 10iv makes up for a smaller part of ESF actions (app. 2,5% of the ESF allocation) and is directed towards efforts to improve the transition from school to the labour market, especially of low-skilled young people and people with a migrant background. IP 10iii focuses on upgrading the knowledge, skills and competences of the workforce, mainly already employed persons, to avoid risks for later unemployment (app. 23% of the ESF allocation). IPs have been assessed on how they address the challenges as identified in the CSR and CPP, scoring each IP on a five-point scale whether the IP is explicitly addressing one of the challenges, partly or not all. Six out of five IPs address one of the challenges identified in the CSR and CPP. Specifically, the IPs under the regular ESF OP are explicitly addressing one or more of the challenges in the CPP and/or the CSR. There is a close connection between the architecture of the Swedish ESF OP and the CPP and CSR. The IP only implicitly addressing the challenges in the CPP and the CSR is contained in the CLLD OP financed by ESF funding. In the OP, there is not the same cohesive reasoning based on the challenges presented in the CSR and the CPP. There is a sound reasoning between the challenges and the Specific Objective of the CLLD OP in order to address the challenges. However, the argumentation is on a general level, and it is harder to see how it is to be implemented. The relation between the IP and the challenges are however positive. ",

Analysing the distribution and concentration of budget among IPs across OPs the following can be concluded: \uf0b7 Focus of ESF: The ESF in Sweden is highly focused on the need to increase the labour market participation of vulnerable groups, specifically non-EU nationals and low-educated young people. This is expressed in the large proportion of funds allocated for IPs 8i, 8iii, and 9i. IP 8i has a general ambition to fund actions for long-term unemployed, and 8ii is specifically oriented towards young people. 9i differs from the IPs under TO8 in its focus on people who are very far from the labour market as a result of complex problems. Furthermore, this means that ESF in Sweden is focused on people outside the labour market. Actions under IPs 10iii and 10iv (approximately 25% of budget) are directed toward employed individuals with a focus on increasing the adaptability of workers. \uf0b7 Social inclusion: The budget allocation for social inclusion, as defined by actions covered by all IPs that belong to TO9, amounts to 154.5 Meuro. This represents approximately 20,84% of the total national ESF budget. This is distributed over both OPs, even if it should be noted that the relative size of the CLLD OP is very small. However, the CLLD OP is fully dedicated to Social Inclusion. \uf0b7 Concentration principle: In the Swedish OPs, budget is allocated on a selected number of IPs. As requested in CPR and ESF regulations, all OPs comply with the request to allocate ESF budget on a limited number of IPs. 96% of the total budget allocated is distributed over the five largest investment priorities. 5. Intervention logic and internal coherence 5.1 Relationship between Specific objectives and Investment priorities Within Sweden ESF programming, a total of six IPs are selected. The primary focus of the Swedish ESF OP is on increasing labour market participation. Three IPs, which receive the major budget allocation of the OP, have Specific Objectives directed at increased levels of employment at individual level. The focus of the ESF OP is to strengthen and develop national labour market policy. This is also mirrored in the Specific Objective of IP 9i where the specific objective is to develop methods on project level that is mainstreamed in regular national labour market policy. The SO 10iv reflects that the ESF OP is expected to contribute to a better matching of education institutions and the needs of the labour market. The SO for IP 10iii focuses on upgrading the knowledge, skills and competences of the workforce, mainly already employed persons, to avoid risks for later unemployment ",
        "- 9 - The SOs of the CLLD OPs are generally to increase the adaptability of workers in rural areas in order to increase their employability. In theory the specific objective of an IP should effectively narrow down the scope of the IP and fully capture the (direction of the) change which the Member State seeks to achieve with EU support. Moreover, the specific objectives should be specific enough to be quantitatively evaluated. All SO across the different OPs were carefully assessed on this aspect. The Specific Objectives in the Swedish OPs partly comply with the criteria set for this analysis. The SOs that are not meeting the criteria sort under the CLLD OP, in which the implementation of actions is not sufficiently narrowed down. Regarding the SOs for IPs under TO10 (10iii, 10iv), the specific objectives clearly states the direction of the IP, but the preconditions for a quantitative (impact) evaluation are not explicitly stated. The same applies for the SO for IP 8ii focusing on the implementation of methods. For the individual oriented SOs under IPs 8i, 8ii and 9i, there is good coherence between the SO, the challenges related to the IP and the expected results of the SO. 5.2 Relationship between actions and Investment Priorities Actions should contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives. The table below provides an overview what type of actions are selected per IP. Per IP maximum four actions are selected based on the description in the OP, as identified in the columns of the table, while the rows reflect the IP across all ESF programme in the country.

ESF actions are used to reinforce and develop regular labour market policy by making possible action over separate policy fields. Focus is on interventions for individuals in order to develop basic skills needed for entering and remaining within the labour market. This applies for actions under IPs 8i, 8ii, 9i, and 9vi. Actions under 10iii and 10iv are directed toward employed individuals, but are also based on an integrated approach. Finally, actions should contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives under the relevant Investment Priorities. In order to assess whether this is the case we assessed all actions falling under each IP. In general a good coherence was found between actions and SO/IPs. In the regular ESF OP, there is a coherent presentation of the actions relating to specific objectives. SOs narrow down the scope of the IPs and outline the direction of the desired change. Actions are specific enough to be quantitatively evaluated and there is a direct alignment and coherence between actions, IP and SO. The actions described are clearly contributing to the achievement ",
        "- 10 - of specific objectives. The exception relates to the CLLD OP, where the argumentation is coherent, but the presentation is not clear regarding how the proposed actions (that are widely presented) will feed into the SO for the IP. 5.3 Specific objectives and target groups addressed Investment priorities and specific objectives address different target groups. The table below provides an overview on the target groups addressed by IPs on country level. Table 6 Type of target groups related to investment priorities.

IP 8i has a general focus on unemployed individuals. Primary (sub-)target group is young unemployed, thereafter migrants and people with disabilities. IP 8ii has a specific focus on young unemployed in general and, in accordance with the challenges, particularly those who are not working or studying. IP 9i The IP has a general focus on unemployed individuals. Primary (sub) target group is people with complex problems, specifically migrants. IPs under TO10 are directed toward people within the labour force. Target groups for IP 10iii are employed individuals in the work force. Also, a small number of unemployed is included in the target group so that such individuals can participate in actions in order to promote recruitment to companies. The aim is both for the unemployed to upskill and get work experience, references and access to work-related networks, and for employers to get a wider recruitment base. IP 10iv addresses better matching between education and labour market. Central target groups are local and regional organisations together with work-life oriented schools. The CLLD OP funds actions under IP 9vi and focus is on employees, and particularly on employees at risk in rural areas. An assessment was also made on the coherence between the target groups and actions on IP level, indicating whether the defined target groups fully match the specific objectives falling under that IP. In general is a good coherence between target groups and specific objectives. There are specific target groups and good alignment with the specific objectives. There is a clear reasoning and coherence between the target groups and the SOs. Target group definitions are broad enough for implementation, but specific enough for evaluation.

        "- 11 - 5.4 Relationship between output and result indicators and specific objectives / actions Coherence between result indicators and specific objectives While developing result indicators it is important that these indicators represent the specific objectives and the changes foreseen. For each result indicator an assessment was made whether this was the case. In the figure below an overview is provided for how many result indicators this was (somewhat) the case or not. Figure 1 Coherence between result indicators and specific objectives. The figure above shows that there are 26 results indicators relating to Specific Objectives in Sweden. 24 indicators relate to actions under the ESF OP. These indicators are generally coherent with specific objectives and the policy interventions supported. They represent the specific objective and capture the changes foreseen. The exception is one result indicator under IP 10iii, where the indicator concerns entities, but the focus of the SO is employed individuals. Regarding the CLLD OP, the directions of the two result indicators are aligned with the SO. The result indicators are however vague and missing several aspects regarding measurement. It is, however, explained in the CLLD OP document OP (annexes) that baselines and targets will be developed by the Local Action Groups according to the Locally led community development model. Coherence between output indicators and actions Just as for the result indicators, output indicators should reflect the scope of activities implemented by ESF. Also for the output indicators and assessment was made how these reflect the actions. There is generally a good coherence between output indicators and specific objectives. The two exceptions are one result indicator under IP 10iii, where the indicator concerns entities, but the focus of the SO is employed individuals. In other regards, the output indicator is aligned with the SO. 24 2 0 0 3. the result indicator represents for a large part the specific objective and scope of the changes foreseen 2. the result indicator represents somewhat the specific objective and scope of the changes foreseen 1. the result indicator represents limited the specific objectives and scope of the changes foreseen 0.

        "- 12 - 6. PROGRAMME PERFORMANCE One of the key elements introduced by the Regulations is that programmes should provide clear, transparent, measurable aims and targets for accountability and results. Countries and regions are requested to clearly state the objectives they intend to achieve with available resources and indicate how progress towards these goals will be measured (Performance Framework). This will allow regular monitoring and debate on how financial resources are used. 6.1 Outputs of ESF on country level The actions undertaken by the different programmes lead to outputs. Output indicators are measured in physical (or monetary) units. In the context of the intervention logic of the programmes under cohesion policy output indicators should be logically linked to and reflect the types of actions planned. The outputs should also contribute towards the achievement of results and the targets set for the output indicators should be consistent with the financial allocation envisaged. Total aggregation of target values of output indicators on national level Total aggregations by gender None of the output indicators information are specified for men and women. Total aggregations by Investment Priority Output indicators have been clustered around common categories, roughly corresponding to the Common Output Indicators of Annex 1 of ESF Reg. (for a full list of categories and their description, see Annex I \u2013 Methodological Note). The table below provides an overview of how output indicators aggregated according to these categories relate to each IP, aggregating target values on country level. Table 7 Overview of output indicators linked to investment priorities. The table above shows that in Sweden a limited number of output indicators are used. Typically, one output indicator is dedicated to one IP. The exception is IP 10iii, where a limited number of unemployed individuals are expected to participate in actions for work place learning. The output indicators show that the Swedish OPs are constructed based on target groups, rather than interventions. At the same time, the output indicators show that the Swedish OPs are used to deal with challenges specifically related to unemployment. Even if the number of employed participants is higher, this IP constitutes a minor (app. 25%) part of the budget allocated for ESF actions in Sweden. The table shows that even if the ESF programme is primarily dedicated to support for unemployed individuals, the majority of the participants are employed individuals. This output is expected from large projects focused on work place learning in companies.

Total aggregations of output indicators included in the performance framework Countries and regions are requested to clearly state the results they intend to achieve with available resources and indicate how progress towards these goals will be measured (Performance Framework). A selection of common output indicators are used for the performance framework to measure the progress made by the programme by 31 December 2018 and to be assessed in 2019.Of all output indicators 25% are included in the performance framework. Concerning financial indicators, for the CLLD OP it is expected that 100% of available resources will have been spent by the end of 2018; for the National OP it is expected that 38% of resources will have been spent (not considering YEI or TA budget) Table 8 Financial milestone targets by OP Operational Programme Target (2023) Milestone (2018) Share milestone total budget (%) Lokaltleddutveckling med st\u00f6dfr\u00e5n Regional autvecklings fonde noch Socialfonden 2014-2020 800.953,50 800.953,50 100 Nationelltsocialfondsprogramf\u00f6rinvesteringf\u00f6rtillv\u00e4 xtochsyssels\u00e4ttning 2014-2020 1.378.873.026 520.164.838 38 Information on the methodology of target setting Reviewing the way how targets are set, selected indicators were assessed on whether information is provided in the operational programme on the justification of how the target values for indicators has been calculated and what methodology is used for setting the target for output indicators.

Therefore target values are defined as well. Total aggregation of target values of result indicators at the national level Table 9 below provides an overview of aggregated target values (expressed in absolute values) across categories of Result Indicators per IP on country level (a full list of common categories of result indicators used for the purposes of this analysis is presented in Annex I: Categories) 3 .

Further exploration of a number of selected themes This section explores how specific themes have been addressed by ESF at the country level, namely the youth employment strategy and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), the institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration, and the investment in Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs). These themes are operationalised in terms or Investment Priorities that are related to these themes. The table below provides an overview how these themes are addressed in the ESF OPs in the country.

        "- 16 - Theme Identified in challenges? How Is the theme addressed? How much budget is allocated to each theme Youth employment policies (IP 8ii) In CSR, it is stated that Sweden needs to strengthen efforts to improve integration in the labour market for unskilled young people and people with a migrant background through stronger and more targeted measures to enhance their employability and demand for these groups' labour. Furthermore, there is a need to strengthen efforts to facilitate the transition from school to work, including through wider use of workplace learning, apprenticeships and other forms of contract that combines work and education. Young unemployed are the primary focus of the European Social Fund in Sweden. The theme is addressed by selecting IP 8ii, which also integrates actions and funds under YEI. Two SO are selected under the IP, one for ESF and one for YEI. SO 3.1 represents a separate Priority Axis in the National Swedish OP. YEI: \u20ac 88.326.192 (of which 44.163.096 ESF co-financing) ESF: \u20ac 193,917,522 Enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration (IP 11.i) No - - Investment in Active Labour Market Policy (8i, 8ii, 8v and partly 8iii.) Yes ALMP are found across all IPs Main allocation under IP8i:_ \u20ac 142,161,000 ALMPs are mainstreamed across the different IPs Youth employment The Youth Employment Initiative is activated in the Swedish ESF OP. Low labour market participation is one on the crucial challenges in Sweden, and the Social Fund is to a large extent used for efforts to include unemployed young people in the labour force. YEI is treated as a separate Priority Axis in the Swedish ESF OP, which is allocated 44 Meuro in ESF funding (half of the total YEI allocation. This constitutes approximately 10% of the ESF programme in Sweden. In the monitoring system, YEI is sorted under IP 8ii and treated as a part of actions directed towards young people. Interventions under YEI are planned to be less innovative than other actions and instead be based on tested methods. 50% of the budget for YEI is implemented through the National Employment Services in Sweden, and 50% by regional initiatives in the three (of eight in total) regions concerned.
