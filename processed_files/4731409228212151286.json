        "I (Acts whose publication is obligatory) REGULATION (EC) No 1567/2003 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2003 on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 179 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The Community is deeply concerned by the reproductive and sexual health conditions of women and men, in particular those aged 15 to 49, in developing countries. High maternal mortality and morbidity rates, the lack of a full range of safe and reliable reproductive and sexual health care and services, supplies and information, and the spread of HIV/AIDS undermine all efforts to eradi- cate poverty, enhance sustainable development, expand opportunities and safeguard livelihoods in developing countries. (2) Individual freedom of choice for women, men and adolescents through adequate access to information, education and services in matters concerning their repro- ductive and sexual health and rights is a significant element of progress and development and requires action by governments as well as individual responsi- bility. (3) The right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a fundamental human right which is in line with the provisions of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This right is being denied to over a fifth of the world's population. (4) Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union calls for a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. (5) The Community and its Member States uphold the right of individuals to decide freely on the number and spacing of their children; they condemn any violation of human rights in the form of compulsory abortion, compulsory sterilisation, infanticide, or the rejection, abandonment or abuse of unwanted children as a means of curbing population growth. (6) Both the European Parliament and the Council have called for greater efforts by the Community in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights in devel- oping countries. (7) Article 25(1)(c) and (d) and Article 31(b)(iii) of the ACP- EU Partnership Agreement ( 3 ) signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 clearly aim to integrate strategies to improve access to basic social services. (8) The Community and its Member States will continue to contribute greatly to the wider effort to support policies and programmes on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries, and undertake to continue to play a leading role in this area, giving priority to health as part of a global strategy to fight poverty. (9) The Community and its Member States are determined to make a full contribution towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals of reducing by three- quarters the rate of maternal mortality, achieving gender equality, and attaining access to sexual and reproductive health care and services worldwide. (10) The Monterrey Conference stipulates that increased offi- cial development assistance (ODA) and debt relief schemes should be used for the benefit of better health and education outcomes and the EU has an important role to play in exploring how increased ODA could be used more effectively for improved sustainable develop- ment. 6.9.2003 L 224/1 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ C 151 E, 25.6.2002, p. 260.

        "(11) The International Conference on Population and Devel- opment (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994 and the ICPD + 5 in 1999 set out an ambitious agenda. The Community and its Member States maintain their commitment to the specific reproductive health goal that was agreed at the ICPD, to make accessible, through the primary health- care system, reproductive health care to all individuals of appropriate ages as soon as possible and no later than 2015 (ICPD Programme of Action, point 7.6). (12) The Community and its Member States are committed to upholding the principles agreed at the ICPD and the ICPD + 5 and call upon the international community, in particular the developed countries, collectively to bear the appropriate share of the financial burden defined in the ICPD Programme of Action. (13) Since the ICPD, progress has been made, yet there is still much to be done to ensure that every woman has the chance of a healthy pregnancy and of giving birth in safe conditions, that the sexual and reproductive health needs of young people are met and that the violence and abuse suffered by women is stopped, including in refugee and conflict situations. (14) The sustained supply, availability and affordability of more effective and acceptable methods of contraception and protection from sexually transmitted infection, including HIV/AIDS, is crucial in achieving the ICPD goals; this calls for an adequate supply and choice of quality reproductive-health-related supplies for every person who needs them. This form of security requires not only the commodities themselves, but the capacity to forecast, finance, procure and deliver them to the places where they are needed, when they are needed. (15) The 1995 UN Beijing Conference on Women and the Beijing + 5 Conference reaffirmed the goals of the ICPD Programme of Action, recognising that unsafe abortions threaten the lives of a large number of women, and that deaths and injuries could be prevented through safe and effective reproductive health measures. (16) No support is to be given under this Regulation to incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion, or to the improper testing of contraception methods in devel- oping countries. When cooperation measures are imple- mented, the decisions adopted at the ICPD, in particular point 8.25 of the ICPD Programme of Action, according to which, inter alia , abortion should in no case be promoted as a method of family planning, must be rigorously observed. Post-abortion counselling, education and family planning services should be offered promptly, which will also help to avoid repeat abortions. (17) Experience shows that population and development programmes are most effective when steps have been taken to improve the status of women (ICPD Programme of Action, point 4.1). Gender equality is a precondition for improved reproductive health, and men should take full responsibility for their sexual and reproductive beha- viour (ICPD Programme of Action, point 4.25). (18) The effectiveness of programmes to support nationally led strategies to improve reproductive and sexual health in developing countries partly depends on the improved coordination of aid at both the European and the inter- national level, in particular with the UN agencies, funds and programmes, and more specifically the UN Popula- tion Fund. (19) Reproductive health providers have a major role to play in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other sexually trans- mitted infections. (20) Council Regulation (EC) No 1484/97 of 22 July 1997 on aid for population policies and programmes in devel- oping countries ( 1 ), applicable until 31 December 2002, is rendered obsolete by this Regulation and should there- fore be repealed. The experience acquired during its application should be reflected in the application of this new Regulation. (21) This Regulation lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure ( 2 ), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. (22) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 3 ). (23) As the objectives of the proposed action, namely to improve reproductive and sexual health and to secure respect for the rights related thereto, with particular reference to developing countries, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accor- dance with the principle of proportionality also set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,6.9.2003 L 224/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ L 202, 30.7.1997, p. 1.

        "HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Chapter I Purpose and scope Article 1 1. The Community shall support actions to improve repro- ductive and sexual health in developing countries and to secure respect for the rights relating thereto. 2. The Community shall provide financial assistance and appropriate expertise with a view to promoting a holistic approach to, and the recognition of, reproductive and sexual health and rights as defined in the ICPD Programme of Action, including safe motherhood and universal access to a compre- hensive range of safe and reliable reproductive and sexual health care and services. 3. In the allocation of such funding and expertise, priority shall be given to: (a) the poorest and least developed countries and the most disadvantaged sections of the populations of developing countries; (b) action that complements and reinforces both the policies and capacities of developing countries and the assistance provided through other instruments of development coop- eration. Article 2 The purpose of the activities carried out under this Regulation shall be to: (a) secure the right of women, men and adolescents to good reproductive and sexual health; (b) enable women, men and adolescents to have access to a comprehensive range of high-quality, safe, accessible, affordable and reliable reproductive and sexual health care services, supplies, education and information, including information on all kinds of family planning methods; (c) reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates, with parti- cular reference to the countries and populations where these are highest. Article 3 1. Community financial support shall be given to specific operations targeting the poorest and most vulnerable popula- tions in both rural and urban areas, designed to achieve the purposes described in Article 2, and, in particular, to those which aim to: (a) support and promote policy and operational frameworks and action, tailored to meet specific targets for the progres- sive realisation of people's rights to adequate basic health services and accountable service providers; (b) ensure better access to high-quality reproductive and sexual health services, offering, in particular, contraceptive choice and the prevention and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, and the provision of volun- tary confidential counselling and testing; (c) offer adolescents and young adults educational programmes that focus on the relationship between family planning, reproductive health, sexually transmitted diseases and the impact of HIV/AIDS on partnerships, and provide them with the necessary information, services and skills to protect their reproductive and sexual health, avoid unwanted pregnancies and involve them in the design and implementation of such programmes; (d) combat practices harmful to the sexual and reproductive health of women, adolescents and children, such as female genital mutilation, sexual violence, child marriages and early marriages; (e) ensure the sustained supply, availability and affordability of more effective and acceptable methods of contraception and protection from sexually transmitted infection, including HIV/AIDS; (f) promote comprehensive maternal health programmes, including the provision of quality antenatal care, care during childbirth and post-natal care, and the establishment and/or expansion of a body of skilled birth attendants; (g) provide effective emergency obstetric and post-partum care, including treatment for complications resulting from unsafe abortion; (h) reduce unsafe abortions by decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies through the provision of family planning services, compassionate counselling and informa- tion, including the use of contraception, and by investing in the training and equipping of suitable staff, including medical service personnel, to manage under hygienic and safe conditions the complications resulting from unsafe abortion. 2. In order to implement the abovementioned operations, particular attention shall be given to the need to improve the health systems of developing countries. In this process, the participation and consultation of local communities, families and stakeholders, with special attention to the poor, women and adolescents, shall be ensured. In addition, with a view to ensuring that improvements in health and well-being are sustainable, all operations shall be conducted in tandem with broad-based investments in the social sector, covering educa- tion, community action, equity and gender awareness, environ- mental improvement, economic well-being, food-security and nutrition. Article 4 1. In the context of the operations referred to in Article 3, Community support may take the form of: (a) funding of research and programmes for action (which shall, as far as possible, be carried out by or in collabora- tion with experts or institutions of the partner country); 6.9.2003 L 224/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "(b) technical assistance, training, counselling or other services; (c) supplies, such as medical supplies, commodities and works; (d) audits, evaluation and monitoring missions. Priority shall be given to enhancing national capacities with a view to long-term viability. 2. Community financing may cover both investment expen- diture, excluding the purchase of real estate, and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, taking into account the fact that the operation must, as far as possible, aim at medium-term viability, recurring expenditure as well (including administrative expenditure, maintenance and running costs), which tempora- rily represents a burden for the partner, so that maximum use is made of the support referred to in paragraph 1. Chapter II Implementation of aid Article 5 1. Community financing under this Regulation shall take the form of grants. 2. A financial contribution from the partners defined in Article 6 shall be sought for each cooperation operation. In specifying the amount of the contribution requested, account shall be taken of the capacity of the partners concerned and the nature of the operation in question. In certain circumstances, the contribution may be in kind if the partner is either a non- governmental organisation (NGO) or a community-based orga- nisation. 3. The provision of financial assistance under this Regula- tion may entail co-financing with other donors, in particular with Member States, the United Nations, and international or regional development banks or financial institutions. 4. In the context of the operations referred to in Article 3(1)(b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), efforts shall be made to integrate interventions targeting reproductive and sexual health and rights with actions targeting poverty diseases. Article 6 1. The partners eligible for financial assistance under this Regulation include: (a) administrative authorities and agencies at national, regional and local government levels; (b) local authorities and other decentralised bodies; (c) local communities, NGOs, community-based organisations and other not-for-profit natural and legal persons from the private sector; (d) regional organisations; (e) international organisations, such as the United Nations and its agencies, funds and programmes, as well as development banks, financial institutions, global initiatives and interna- tional public-private partnerships; (f) research institutes and universities. 2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1(e), Community finan- cial assistance shall be available to partners whose head office is located in a Member State or in a third country that is a beneficiary or potential beneficiary of Community assistance under this Regulation, provided that this office is the actual centre directing business operations. In exceptional cases, this office may be located in another third country. Article 7 1. Where operations are the subject of financing agreements between the Community and countries which benefit from operations financed under this Regulation, the agreements shall stipulate that the payment of taxes, duties and charges shall not be financed by the Community. 2. Any financing agreement or contract concluded under this Regulation shall stipulate that it is subject to the supervi- sion and financial control of the Commission which may carry out spot-checks and inspections, and to audits by the Court of Auditors, in accordance with the usual arrangements laid down by the Commission under the provisions in force, particularly those in the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 1 ), hereinafter \u2018the Finan- cial Regulation\u2019. 3. The necessary measures shall be taken to emphasise the Community character of aid provided under this Regulation. Article 8 1. Participation in invitations to tender for the award of contracts shall be open on equal terms to all natural and legal persons in the Member States and in all developing countries. It may be extended, in exceptional cases, to other third countries. 2. Supplies shall originate in the beneficiary country, other developing countries or the Member States. In exceptional cases, supplies may originate from other third countries. Article 9 1. In order to secure the objectives of consistency and complementarity referred to in the Treaty and to ensure maximum effectiveness of these operations as a whole, the Commission may take all necessary coordination measures, including: (a) the establishment of a system for the systematic exchange and analysis of information on the operations financed and those which the Community and the Member States propose to finance; 6.9.2003 L 224/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1. ",
        "(b) on-the-spot coordination of the implementation of opera- tions through regular meetings and exchanges of informa- tion between the representatives of the Commission and the Member States in the recipient country. 2. The Commission, in liaison with the Member States, may take any initiative necessary for ensuring proper coordination with the other donors concerned, in particular those forming part of the United Nations system. Chapter III Financial and decision-making procedures Article 10 1. The financial framework for the implementation of this Regulation for the period from 2003 to 2006 is hereby set at EUR 73,95 million. The annual allocation shall be subject to the agreement of the budgetary authority on the appropriate means of financing under the Financial Perspective or through the use of the instruments provided for by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999. 2. The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the Financial Perspec- tive. Article 11 1. The Commission shall be responsible for drafting strategic programming guidelines, defining the Community's coopera- tion in terms of measurable objectives, priorities, deadlines for specific areas of action, assumptions and expected outcomes. Programming shall be annual and indicative. 2. An annual exchange of views with the Member States shall take place, within the Committee referred to in Article 13(1), on the basis of a presentation by the representative of the Commission of the strategic programming guidelines for the operations to be carried out. The Committee shall give an opinion on these matters in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13(2). Article 12 1. The Commission shall be responsible for appraising, deciding upon and administering the operations covered by this Regulation in accordance with the budgetary and other proce- dures in force, in particular those laid down in the Financial Regulation. 2. Decisions concerning operations for which financing under this Regulation exceeds EUR 3 million and any changes to these operations that entail a cost overrun of more than 20 % of the amount initially fixed for the operation concerned shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13(2). 3. For decisions and changes to these operations amounting to EUR 3 million or less, the Commission shall inform the Member States. Article 13 1. The Commission shall be assisted by the geographically competent committee for development. 2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof. The period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at 45 days. 3. The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure. Chapter IV Reporting and final provisions Article 14 1. After each budget year, the Commission shall submit, in its annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council on Community development policy, information on the guide- lines for its annual indicative strategic programme and on the operations financed in the course of that year, as well as the Commission's conclusions on the implementation of this Regu- lation over the previous budget year. The summary shall in particular provide information on the strengths and weaknesses of operations, those with whom contracts have been concluded and the sums of those contracts, as well as the results of any independent evaluations of specific operations. 2. At the latest one year before the expiry of this Regulation, the Commission shall submit a comprehensive independent appraisal report on its implementation to the European Parlia- ment and the Council with a view to establishing whether the actions undertaken under this Regulation have been effective, and with a view to providing guidelines for improving the effectiveness of future operations. On the basis of this appraisal report the Commission may make proposals for the future of this Regulation and, if necessary, proposals for its amendment. Article 15 Regulation (EC) No 1484/97 shall be repealed. However, opera- tions that have been decided upon under that Regulation shall continue to be implemented under it. Article 16 1. This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . 2. It shall apply until 31 December 2006. 6.9.2003 L 224/5 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

        "REGULATION (EC) No 1568/2003 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2003 on aid to fight poverty diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria) in developing countries THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 179 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a fundamental human right which is in line with the provisions of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This right is being denied to over a fifth of the world's population. (2) Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union calls for a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. (3) HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria cause the deaths of more than five and a half million people each year, their greatest impact being on morbidity and life expectancy in developing countries. Moreover, these diseases wipe out years of development efforts and achievements and constitute a serious concern in the long run because of their destabilising effects on society. (4) It is now widely accepted that prevention, care and treat- ment are mutually dependent and synergistic. (5) The failure to reduce the burden of these diseases and the evidence of their increasing impact have brought them to the centre of the development debate \u2014 as evidenced by the Declaration of Commitment of the Special Session of the UN General Assembly of June 2001, which recognises that HIV/AIDS has evolved to become a developmental emergency, and by the WHO World Health Assembly's declaration of tuberculosis and malaria as global emergencies \u2014 and have led to calls for urgent action and a series of national, regional and international initiatives, all meant to achieve the Millen- nium Development Goals which include clear targets to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and to which the European Community and its Member States committed themselves. (6) The abovementioned UN Declaration of Commitment agreed, for HIV/AIDS alone, to reach by 2005 through a series of incremental steps an overall target of annual expenditure on the epidemic of between USD 7 and 10 thousand million in low and middle-income countries and countries experiencing or at risk of experiencing a rapid spread of the disease, for prevention, care, treat- ment, support and mitigation of the impact of HIV/ AIDS, and to take measures to ensure that the resources needed are made available, particularly from donor countries and also from national budgets, bearing in mind that resources of the most affected countries are seriously limited. (7) HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria require an appro- priate structural response, which is both comprehensive and coherent and which is beyond the financial and human resources of most developing countries. Because of their magnitude and cross-boundary nature, the poverty diseases are among the problems that require a systematic, coordinated response by the international community. Interventions in this area are in everyone's interest and therefore should not be viewed as a question of development aid alone. (8) The Doha Declaration on the Agreement on trade- related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and Public Health affirmed that \u2018the TRIPs Agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health\u2019 and that it \u2018can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all\u2019 and reaffirmed \u2018the right of WTO members to use, to the full, the provisions in the TRIPs Agreement which provide flexibility for this purpose\u2019. (9) The effectiveness of programmes to support national strategies to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria partly depends on the improved coordination of aid at both the European and the international level, notably with UN agencies, funds and programmes, including partnerships between the private, public and voluntary sectors, and on the use of procedures tailored to the specific nature of the strategies and partners concerned. 6.9.2003 L 224/7 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ C 151 E, 25.6.2002, p. 202. ( 2 ) Opinion of the European Parliament of 30 January 2003 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and Decision of the Council of 16 June 2003. ",
        "(10) Public health is a public responsibility. Inadequate public policy has compounded the failure of the market to generate research and development for neglected diseases. In 2000, only 10 % of all research and develop- ment concerned diseases that are responsible for 90 % of disease in the world. The dynamics of neglect are different for different diseases, and distinct strategies to correct this imbalance are needed. Comprehensive action needs to be taken to compensate for the market failure in drug development, through increased public funding, including supporting the research and development of specific global public goods and effective methods of prevention and treatment to confront these diseases in developing countries and the introduction of appropriate incentives for the private sector to invest accordingly. (11) Actions specifically targeted at the poverty diseases must be appropriately situated within the larger context of generally improved, more effective systems of health care and health services in developing countries. Consid- erable improvement of these systems is vital if HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are to be combated effec- tively. Special efforts must be made to integrate interven- tions targeting the poverty diseases with actions targeting sexual and reproductive health and rights. (12) The improvement of health is a precondition for and a key element of sustainable development. For the partner countries and populations in question, the type of assis- tance provided for by this Regulation therefore plays a direct and tangible part in development and thus contri- butes significantly to the Community's development cooperation policy. (13) In the interests of coherence, all Community policies should take account of the objective of improving health and reducing poverty. (14) In its Communications to the Council and the European Parliament of 20 September 2000 and 21 February 2001 on action related to communicable diseases in the context of poverty reduction, the Commission outlined the policy principles and strategic priorities needed to enhance the effectiveness of action by the Community and the Member States in this field. (15) In its Resolutions of 10 November 2000 and 14 May 2001, the Council emphasised the gravity of the HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria epidemics and the need to step up efforts to give more support at national, regional and global levels. (16) The Council, in its resolution of 14 May 2001, and the European Parliament, in its resolution of 4 October 2001 ( 1 ), endorsed the Community Programme for Action: accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the context of poverty reduction, and stressed the need to ensure that adequate and appro- priate human and financial resources were in place to enable effective implementation. (17) The Joint Declaration of 31 May 2001 by the Council and the Commission, the abovementioned European Parliament resolution of 4 October 2001 and the ACP- EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly resolution of 1 November 2001 welcomed the proposal of the UN Secretary-General to establish a Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which came into operation on 29 January 2002, and stressed that contri- butions to this Fund should be additional to existing resources. (18) The abovementioned UN Declaration of Commitment, and in particular the Monterrey Conference, stipulates that increased Official Development Assistance (ODA) and debt relief schemes should be used for the benefit of better health and education outcomes. The Community and its Member States have an important role to play in exploring how increased ODA, including debt relief mechanisms, could be used more effectively as tools for combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. (19) In its Resolutions of September 1998, October 2000 and March 2002, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly underlined the threat posed by HIV/AIDS to all development efforts and the need for rapid action. (20) This Regulation renders obsolete Council Regulation (EC) No 550/97 of 24 March 1997 on HIV/AIDS-related operations in developing countries ( 2 ), which should therefore be repealed.

(23) The objective of the proposed action, namely to combat the three major communicable diseases within the context of poverty reduction, with particular reference to developing countries, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at a Community level, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportion- ality also set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary, in order to achieve that objective, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Chapter I Purpose and scope Article 1 1. The Community shall implement the European Commu- nity Programme for Action targeting the three major commu- nicable diseases, namely HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, in developing countries. 2. Under that Programme the Community shall provide financial assistance and appropriate expertise to actors in devel- opment in order to improve access to health for all and to promote equitable economic growth, within the overall objec- tive of reducing poverty with a view to its eventual eradication. 3. In the allocation of such funding and expertise, priority shall be given to: (a) the poorest and least developed countries and the most disadvantaged sections of the population within developing countries; (b) action that complements and reinforces both the policies and capacities of developing countries and the assistance provided through other instruments of development coop- eration. Article 2 The purpose of the activities carried out under this Regulation shall be to: (a) optimise the impact of existing interventions, services and commodities aimed at preventing and fighting the major communicable diseases affecting the poorest populations; (b) increase the affordability of key pharmaceuticals and diag- nostics for the three diseases; (c) increase research and development, including vaccines, microbicides and innovative treatments. Article 3 Community financial support shall be given to specific projects designed to achieve the purposes described in Article 2 and, in particular, to those which aim to: (a) provide the necessary technical, scientific and normative input in order to prioritise health interventions within the total development cooperation budget and improve health outcomes relating to the three major communicable diseases, keeping a balanced approach between prevention, treatment and care, with prevention as a key priority, acknowledging that its effectiveness is increased when linked with treatment and care; recognition has to be given to the fact that important measures have to be looked for through a multi-sectoral approach, including targeting behavioural patterns as well as factors such as clean water and sanitation, land-use planning, nutrition and gender mainstreaming; (b) improve the performance of health interventions targeted at the three major communicable diseases within the context of a strengthened comprehensive health system, including public services; (c) improve understanding of effects of the poverty diseases on social and economic development, as well as the impact of strategies aimed at mitigating the negative socioeconomic effects connected with the diseases; (d) improve pharmaceutical policies and practice, and help developing countries, at regional or national level, to develop high-quality local production of key preventive and therapeutic pharmaceuticals consistent with the Doha Declaration on the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property (TRIPs) and Public Health; (e) promote a tiered pricing mechanism for key pharmaceuti- cals for developing countries that will guarantee the lowest possible prices; (f) analyse the effects of factors such as the level of net import price, tariffs, taxes, and importation, distribution and local registration fees on consumer prices of medical goods in developing countries; 6.9.2003 L 224/9 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.

        "(g) provide, where appropriate, technical assistance to devel- oping countries to help them address public health issues in accordance with the provisions of the TRIPs Agreement as clarified in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPs Agree- ment and Public Health, so as to enable the developing countries to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all; (h) encourage public investment and develop an incentive package to encourage more private investment in Research and Development for new treatments, particularly vaccines and microbicides, diagnostics, and fixed-dose combinations designed to fight the major communicable diseases in developing countries; (i) support team-based clinical, epidemiological, operational and social studies, so as to enable health-related research to be conducted on a sounder basis; where appropriate, teams shall be encouraged also to include personnel from the developing countries as a way of contributing to the training of such personnel; (j) encourage capacity building in developing countries, to enable them to coordinate, host and conduct large-scale population trials and to complete all stages of the research and development process; (k) support global initiatives targeting the major communicable diseases in the context of poverty reduction, including the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria which came into operation on 29 January 2002; (l) support initiatives which enable the quality of pharmaceuti- cals to be supervised and monitored. Article 4 1. In the context of the operations referred to in Article 3, Community support may take the form of: (a) financial assistance; (b) technical assistance, training, including of doctors and para- medics, or other services; (c) supplies, such as medical supplies, commodities, and works; (d) audits, evaluation and monitoring missions; (e) transfer of technology and know-how, where possible, for the purpose of local pharmaceuticals production. Priority shall be given to enhancing national capacity with a view to long-term viability. 2. Community financing may cover both investment expen- diture, excluding the purchase of real estate, and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, taking into account the fact that the operation must, as far as possible, aim at medium-term viability, recurring expenditure as well (including administrative expenditure, maintenance and running costs), which tempora- rily represents a burden for the partner, so that maximum use is made of the support referred to in paragraph 1. Chapter II Procedures for the implementation of aid Article 5 1. Community financing under this Regulation shall take the form of grants. 2. A financial contribution from the partners defined in Article 6 shall be sought for each cooperation operation. In specifying the amount of the contribution requested, account shall be taken of the capacity of the partners concerned and the nature of the operation in question. In certain circumstances, the contribution may be made in kind if the partner is either a non-governmental organisation (NGO) or a community-based organisation. 3. The provision of financial assistance under this Regula- tion may entail co-financing with other donors, in particular with Member States, the United Nations, and international or regional development banks or financial institutions. 4. In the context of the operations referred to in Article 3(h), (i) and (j), financial assistance shall be granted in coordina- tion with the new instruments for product research and devel- opment on poverty-related communicable diseases imple- mented under the Community Framework Programme of Research and Development 2002-2006. 5. The contribution to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria shall be made by means of a financing agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the Trustee of the Global Fund. The contribution shall be adminis- tered following the rules and procedures established for the Global Fund, agreed with the Commission and to be annexed to the financing agreement. 6. In the context of the operations referred to in Article 3(h), (i) and (j), efforts shall be made to exploit the synergies with policies and programming in the area of sexual and repro- ductive health, in particular for HIV/AIDS interventions.

Without prejudice to paragraph 1(e), Community finan- cial assistance shall be available to partners whose head office is located in a Member State or in a third country that is a beneficiary or potential beneficiary of Community assistance under this Regulation, provided that this office is the actual centre directing business operations. In exceptional cases, this office may be located in another third country. Article 7 1. Where operations are the subject of financing agreements between the Community and countries which benefit from operations financed under this Regulation, the agreements shall stipulate that the payment of taxes, duties and charges shall not be financed by the Community. 2. Any financing agreement or contract concluded under this Regulation shall stipulate that it is subject to the supervi- sion and financial control of the Commission which may carry out spot-checks and inspections, and to audits by the Court of Auditors, in accordance with the usual arrangements laid down by the Commission under the provisions in force, particularly those in the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 1 ), hereinafter \u2018the Finan- cial Regulation\u2019. 3.

That list includes molinate, thiram and ziram. (2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protec- tion products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 ( 5 ), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95 ( 6 ), the following rapporteur Member States were designated, which in turn submitted the rele- vant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regu- lation (EEC) No 3600/92. For molinate the rapporteur Member State was Portugal, and all relevant information was submitted on 30 November 1998. For thiram the Rapporteur Member State was Belgium, and the relevant information was submitted on 15 January 1998. For ziram the rapporteur Member State was Belgium and the relevant information was submitted on 9 June 1998. (3) Those assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. (4) The reviews of all active substances were finalised on 4 July 2003 in the format of the Commission review reports for molinate, thiram and ziram. (5) The reviews of molinate, thiram and ziram did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants. (6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing molinate, thiram or ziram may be expected to satisfy, in general, the require- ments laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Direc- tive. (7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will resulting from the inclusion. (8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provi- sions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protec- tion products containing molinate, thiram or ziram, and in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protec- tion product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
