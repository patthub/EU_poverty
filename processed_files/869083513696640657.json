",
        "C 64/22 EN 28.2.2001 Official Journal of the European Communities H. whereas financial liberalisation including speculative and volatile financial flows, over which the developing countries have little control, in the absence of adequate institutional arrangements to manage the process, has generated significant instability in the international economies, with specially disastrous results for the developing countries, I. stressing that most African countries have suffered from imposed structural adjustments with too little concern for social and environmental aspects, J. recognising the vital importance of education, skills and training in the global knowledge economy; aware of the agonisingly slow progress towards the target of universal primary education by the year 2015 and the lasting problems caused by this; conscious of the need to close the gap between girls and boys in terms of the educational opportunities available to them, K. recognising that the impact and rapid pace of the IT revolution are ushering in fundamental changes that will define the challenges and opportunities for all countries in the future and that IT could become an effective instrument for fostering equality in the field of economic growth and development and for narrowing the gap between the developed and the developing countries, as well as for facilitating access to knowledge and education at all levels of society; regretting however that in Africa especially the development of the IT sector has remained very limited, which means that there is a danger of large sections of the population being excluded from the opportunities offered by technological progress, L. noting the still growing gap between North and South in the scientific and technological field and with regard to the process of rapid accumulation of knowledge and technologies, from which large numbers of people in the developing countries, in the absence of education and material resources, are unable to benefit, M. noting that the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle collapsed after four days of talks without reaching any agreement on a new round, N. recalling that developing countries in particular have publicly expressed in Seattle their disagreement with the procedures used to conduct the Ministerial Conference, which according to them lacked both transparency and equitable participation in the negotiations, and therefore announced their unwillingness to join a so-called consensus, O. noting that massive demonstrations throughout the Conference have shown the high degree of popular dissatisfaction with WTO-led globalisation, and calling for greater recognition of the question of full respect for human rights, such as the right to education and health, the loss of jobs and income, food and water insecurity, environmental degradation and non-accountability of WTO decisions, P. recalling that for most countries of the South, agriculture remains the mainstay of their economies, the majority of the population still lives in rural areas and are therefore particularly endangered by the impact of globalisation if account is not taken of their needs in strategic planning at regional and national level, Q. concerned at the downward trend of expenditure by OECD countries on development cooperation which, on average, falls far below the UN target of 0,7 % of GDP, R. recalling that the debt crisis is one of the greatest obstacles to achieving the international development targets for ACP and other developing countries, S. having regard to the increasing commitment of civil society to become actively involved in democratic, political, social, economic and community development, requiring in particular the purposeful involvement of local actors, T. maintaining its commitment to work towards the establishment of a just and democratic international economic system and emphasising that the process of globalisation must go hand in hand with a strengthening of democratic structures in the ACP and EU countries to prevent it from having an unfavourable impact on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, ",
        "28.2.2001 EN C 64/23 Official Journal of the European Communities On Trade 1. Considers the failure of the WTO Conference in Seattle to be a strong signal that if the WTO is to have sufficient political credibility and popular support to engage in a further round of trade negotiations, there must be an in-depth reform of its rules in order to ensure greater fairness amongst unequal partners, and in order to take account of the potential impact on vulnerable groups; rejects any attempt to ignore public mobilisation and return to business as usual; 2. Stresses the principle of universal membership of the WTO; 3. Shares the view that there should be a moratorium on all new WTO negotiations, as long as due respect for the procedures and conditions of transparency, openness and participation permitting adequately balanced results in respect of the interests of all member countries do not exist; 4. Considers that before any further liberalisation is agreed, an assessment of the impact of the Uruguay Round on sustainable development in ACP countries should be undertaken; supports the ongoing effort by the EU to assess the impacts of the future trade rounds, taking into account the reviews of the major UN conferences on women and economic and social issues (Beijing +5 and Copenhagen +5); 5. Affirms that any multilateral negotiations on agriculture must take fully into account the concerns and special needs, including those related to food security and rural employment of developing countries which are predominantly agrarian economies; 6. Calls for research to improve understanding of the linkages between trade liberalisation and poverty reduction. This is essential to ensure that future WTO negotiations and trade policy reforms proposed by donors benefit the poor; 7. Calls for northern countries to open their markets to developing country exports, to eliminate escalating tariffs, and to immediately grant tariff and quota free access for all exports from the 48 poorest countries while safeguarding the interests of ACP countries which benefit from stable export earnings through preferential agreements with the EU; 8. Calls for the expeditious implementation of the Marrakech Ministerial decision on measures concerning possible negative effects of the reform programme on least developed and net food importing developing countries; 9. Calls for support for international action aimed at stabilising commodity prices at more remunerative levels, and national schemes to protect producers against excessive risks; 10. Calls for changes to WTO agreements to allow poor countries greater flexibility to pursue national and regional development strategies, for example by protecting and supporting their agricultural sectors in the interests of promoting food security and rural development; 11. Insists on the need to implement the provisions for special and differential treatment for the developing countries, and for the strengthening of the system of trade preferences, which should also address the needs of LDCs and the needs of a number of small developing countries, while taking into consideration their problems of vulnerability and the risk of marginalisation in the global economy; 12. Points out that until supply-side capacity issues are addressed, very little real progress can be made on integrating the poorest countries into the world economy; the benefits that could be derived from the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and the opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system will not be realised unless the capacity constraints in the ACP countries are addressed; ",
        "C 64/24 EN 28.2.2001 Official Journal of the European Communities 13. Calls on the North to adopt a consistent agricultural policy, involving for example the elimination of subsidies which cause market disruption in the countries of the South and for urgent work on the elimination of tariffs and technical barriers to trade; 14. Considers that priority should be given to the liberalisation of those service sectors where developing countries have the comparative advantage; 15. Emphasises the need adequately to address the key issue of the free movement of legal immigrants; 16. Is extremely concerned that the ultraliberalism enshrined at the WTO is undermining the opportunities for sustainable development; 17. Calls for careful consideration of the extent to which goods and services in sectors such as education, culture and health should be excluded from WTO negotiations; 18. Stresses the importance of the ACP and the EU to form alliances within the WTO to ensure that there is ample flexibility in the interpretation and application of WTO rules and norms, so that the development interest and particular problems of the ACP countries are fully taken into account, and that the commitments on special and differential treatment are given real content; 19. Agrees to establish a Joint Working Group to prepare detailed proposals for the reform of the WTO in the interests of transparency, democratic accountability and the political equality of all WTO members; Financial architecture 20. Affirms that there is an increasing need for the reform of the international financial architecture in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in the management of the international economy. This reform should address financing for development as well as strengthening of the early warning system to provide for improved response capabilities to help countries deal with the emergencies and spread of financial crises; 21. Considers that the time has come to send out a signal heralding a new departure for the implementation of globalisation, and calls therefore on the major industrialised countries and, notably, on the European Union, to introduce a tax on capital transfers as proposed by Professor Tobin; 22. Is of the opinion that the contribution of the transnational corporations to sustained economic growth, determined by their global strategies and characterised by the search for increased competitiveness and higher profits is not always consistent with job creation and the realization of development objectives in many developing countries; in this context it would be convenient to analyse the impact of the merger trend among TNC on small and medium-sized enterprises in ACP countries; 23. Calls on TNCs to integrate development objectives of the host ACP countries into their business strategies and reiterates its support for global investment rules which assign equal priority to both the rights and responsibilities of investors, respecting minimum international agreed standards in the fields of labour, social, environmental and human rights; 24. Considers that debt cancellation should become part of the dialogue within the ACP-EU Partnership and that the EU should encourage other donors also to take measures to relieve or cancel debt ; 25. Considers that debt relief or cancellation should not be at the expense of official development assistance and that the EU should work with other donors to ensure that the Highly Indebted Poor Countries debt relief package is fully funded; 26. Believes that consideration should be given to the creation of an International Debt Arbitration Panel to restructure or cancel debts where debt service has reached such a level as to prevent the country providing necessary basic social services; ",
        "28.2.2001 EN C 64/25 Official Journal of the European Communities Environment 27. Considers that the emergence of global environmental problems has brought about a new level of interdependence between industrialised and developing countries; 28. Advocates a solution to the serious environmental global problems, on the basis of the recognition of the ecological responsibility of the North and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities between developed and developing countries, and highlights the need for developing countries to gain access under preferential terms to the appropriate financial resources and technologies in order to ensure a sustainable development as provided in Agenda XXI; 29. Affirms that the United Nations Conventions on Climate Change, the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Biodiversity Convention are an appropriate framework to promote sustainable development in developing countries, and that South-South cooperation could contribute to the implementation of these conventions; 30. Is concerned that a combination of policy and market failures \u2014 for instance, huge subsidies for non- sustainable practices and the failure to internalise the environmental costs of production and consumption \u2014 is undermining the opportunities for sustainable development; 31. Notes that emission rights trade is not a solution to the growing problem of climate change; 32. Emphasizes the need to work towards harmonising the TRIPS Agreement with the provisions of the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity in the Convention on Biodiversity; 33. Notes the regular incidence of natural disasters and their nefast effects on the development of small and vulnerable economies, in particular Small Island Development States (SIDS), and calls for increasing international assistance for setting up and strengthening national, subregional, regional and international disaster prevention, preparedness and management mechanisms, including early warning systems; Technology and Knowledge 34. Considers that full advantage of the unique opportunity offered by IT should be taken to ensure that its vast benefits reach all humankind by undertaking efforts to make it more widely accessible to, and within, developing countries; 35. Recommends measures to concentrate the potential of communications and information technology on the development of the South, through the adoption of policies and measures that should narrow the gap between developed and developing countries in information and communication technologies, and to strengthen information technology networks at the regional, sub-regional and inter-regional levels with links to global networks; 36. To establish also a South-South network, linking research and development institutions and other centres of excellence in order to enhance the South\u2019s efforts in stabilising strategic South-South programmes of research and development on the protection of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for the prevention and cure of major diseases in the South, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV; 37. Stresses the need to encourage South-South transfers of skills; 38. Invites the Commission and the signatories of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement to explore the possibility of formulating proposals to ensure that the TRIPS agreement promotes development in ACP countries, including the possibility for a code of conduct for all countries which facilitate the access to, and the dissemination and transfer of technologies on concessional and preferential terms from developed to developing countries; the review of the TRIPS agreement as mandated in Art. 27 and 71 should make it more responsive to the needs of the South and to ensure access of developing countries to knowledge and technology on preferential terms; ",
        "C 64/26 EN 28.2.2001 Official Journal of the European Communities 39. Deeply concerned about the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic which threatens to undermine advances achieved in the social and economic fields in ACP countries, calls on the ACP governments to draw up broad national action plans on HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention and to arrange without delay for the requisite health measures in the field of care and medical treatment, urges the international community to adopt concrete measures to mitigate the disastrous effects of HIV/AIDS, including encouraging local production and universal distribution of and ensuring access to affordable drugs together with the countries concerned; 40. Calls, in the event of an insufficient reduction in the prices of medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and the resultant diseases, for application of the principle of free granting of licences to the states concerned to manufacture and market these medicines, on the grounds that a medical emergency is involved; Democracy and Global Governance 41. Considers that it is required to develop the political dimension of globalisation which, at present is largely absent from international relations; stresses therefore the importance of political dialogue within the ACP-EU partnership and calls on EU and ACP governments to take the opportunity jointly to exert influence at international level to ensure that globalisation takes into account the development dimension and that institutions are created in which developing countries can make their voices heard on an equal footing; 42. Supports the European Parliament\u2019s initiative for the establishment of a world-wide parliamentary assembly for the WTO with fair representation from developing countries and calls on the Member States of the EU to take steps to support increased parliamentary oversight of the WTO including: \u2014 periodical reports and debates in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the European Parliament and national parliaments; \u2014 financial and technical support for capacity-building measures in developing countries aimed at enhancing the ability of national parliaments to exercise effective democratic supervision; \u2014 support for the development of a parliamentary dimension to the WTO, accompanied by all necessary measures to ensure that parliamentarians from all countries are able to participate on an equal basis; 43. States the need for concrete mechanisms that will guarantee full and effective participation by the South in international decision-making, on an equal basis. In this regard the international machinery through which global norms are developed and actions taken must ensure that the countries of the South can participate on an equal footing in decisions which affect them most of all; 44. Moreover, the international economic governance institutions must promote broad based decision-making which is essential if we are to have a more equitable global political economy; 45. Considers that there is a need to involve civil society in accordance with its own modes of expression in order to render the process of globalisation more democratic, just and transparent; North-South and South-South relations 46. Stresses that regional cooperation and integration is the most meaningful approach for the ACP countries to face the challenges of globalisation and take full advantages of its opportunities; encourages the establishment of appropriate structures at the regional and subregional levels in ACP countries, aimed at removing barriers to the free movement of goods, services and capital; ",
        "28.2.2001 EN C 64/27 Official Journal of the European Communities 47. Emphasises that less developed countries are at a particular disadvantage in the current phase of globalisation and liberalisation and urges the international community to take special initiatives for them, particularly in regard to the eradication of poverty, equitable implementation of the WTO agreements, free access of their exports in the world markets, debt cancellation, increased ODA and incentives for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to LDCs; 48. Considers that a stronger link between debt relief and poverty reduction is needed, with the emphasis on investment in basic health, education, infrastructure and other productive investments; 49. Encourages the major economies of the North, particularly the G-8, to enhance coordination and coherence of their macro-economic policies with development objectives of the South; The new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement 50. Affirms that after the disappointing results of Seattle, the new ACP-EU partnership represents an opportunity to develop a model of true and deep North-South relationship in a globalised world; 51. Stresses the need for all aspects of ACP-EU cooperation, including trade arrangements to be aimed at poverty eradication. Coherence should also be ensured between all other European policies and poverty eradication, including agricultural policies; mechanisms for monitoring coherence between all EC development and other policies should be established as well as mechanisms that enable assessments of the Agreement\u2019s contribution to poverty eradication; 52. Calls on the Commission to ensure that development concerns are taken into account by the DG for Trade when negotiating REPAs/EPAs or ATAs; 53. Recalls that Lom\u00e9 preferences and protocols precisely support the objectives laid out in the preamble to the Agreement establishing the WTO (raising standards of living, ensuring full employment, and promoting sustainable development), and the WTO\u2019s own Plan of Action for LDCs demonstrates that there is a case to be made for treating poorer countries differently; therefore either a waiver from the rules, or better still a change in the rules, will be critical to ensure the continuance of the vital relationship between the EU and the ACP; 54. Stresses that for the ACP-EU partners, obtaining a waiver to the new Agreement is a priority that could greatly restore their confidence with the WTO as a member-driven organisation; 55. In order to enable civil society \u2014 particularly in the South \u2014 to be a true actor of the partnership, considers it necessary to establish and implement a policy on information disclosure to the public by ACP and EU decision makers on proposals made in policy and programming; considers it essential that the participation of representatives of civil society in the EU states should be designed to assist partners in the South with a view to attaining lasting autonomous participation by the local population in the ACP states; 56. Calls on the ACP and EU partners, in order to achieve an enabling environment and support from the international community on the objectives of the new Agreement, which is essential to its success, to step up their cooperation and coordination in other fora; 57. Stresses the importance of the development objectives identified at the major UN conferences and draws particular attention to the commitments made there in the fields of social and human development, food safety, the environment, trade and enhancing respect for women\u2019s rights; calls on the EU and ACP states, under the ACP-EU partnership, to work further to create an integrated and coherent political strategy for development cooperation; 58. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council, the Commission and the WTO. ",

Strongly condemns the verdict delivered by the Guinean State security court; 2. Denounces the political nature of this trial, which aimed to remove Alpha Cond\u00e9 from Guinean political life and prevent him from standing as a candidate in the presidential elections in 2003; 3.

Rejects the present Commission proposal, which still does not take account of the vulnerability of the ACP producers: the \u2018first come first served\u2019 system cannot ensure the marketing of ACP bananas on a regular and remunerative basis; furthermore, the automatic transition, in 2006 or earlier, to the \u2019tariff only\u2019 system proposed by the Commission would bring about the demise of Community banana production as well as that of many ACP banana-producing States; 2. Reiterates that the proposal poses a real threat to the survival of thousands of vulnerable small producers in the ACP countries and of Community banana producers, who are located in some of the least favoured EU regions; 3. Condemns the imposition by the US of punitive import duties on EU imports as well as the further aggravation of the situation currently being envisaged with a rotation of the items on the list and a possible further increase in the excessive tariffs; 4. Calls on the Commission to challenge, in the WTO, the legitimacy of the US trade sanctions; 5. Calls on the United States to suspend the sanctions against the European Union and thereby affirm that its intention is not to harm the ACP economically; 6. Calls on the Commission to resume negotiations for a tariff rate quota system based on the award of licences on a historical basis; 7. Urges the EU and the US and all parties to the dispute to show flexibility and a spirit of compromise in the search for a formula which, even if it does not conform fully to their original wishes, safeguards the legitimate interests of all suppliers, especially the most vulnerable; 8. Calls on the Council of the European Union to ensure that the market access conditions guaranteed to the ACP States by the Cotonou Agreement are not further eroded by any action in the multilateral trading agreements; 9. Reminds the EU that access to the tariff rate quota on the basis of past trade is WTO compatible; 10. Emphasises that the transitional period leading to a \u2018tariff only\u2019 system should be no less than 10 years to enable Community and ACP producers to adapt to the new system; ",

Calls on the European Commission to expedite the disbursement of Special Framework Assistance resources to provide financial support to banana producing countries to improve competitiveness of their industries; 13.

Regrets the absence of any real European immigration policy which should, once in place, establish an overall European migration strategy inspired, inter alia, by humanist ideals and the development of the ACP countries; 10. Deplores the failure of EU governments to adequately assess the extent to which immigration laws and practises in the EU contribute to trafficking and are symptomatic of the failure to recognise the inextricable link between trafficking in human beings, migration and asylum policies; deplores the treatment of victims of traffickers as criminals; is deeply concerned by the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers and the manipulation of the issue of immigration and asylum in EU Member States; calls for a comprehensive and constructive European response to the global issue of migration, trafficking in human beings and asylum; 11.

Expects the political, cultural and religious leaders, as well as the governments of the ACP countries, to include consideration of gender-related issues as fundamental to prevention and treatment strategies, 5.

The Joint Parliamentary Assembly believes that the new emphasis on civil society resulting from the Cotonou Agreement enhances the importance of the ACP-EU Courrier. The Courrier is the only publication to provide information on ACP-EU development cooperation in both the ACP countries and the European Union, and has recently been redesigned successfully. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly consequently feels strongly that the ACP-EU Courrier should continue to be published in its present form, particularly since this would reinforce the European Commission\u2019s intention to be transparent and to inform.
