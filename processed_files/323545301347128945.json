        "BRIEFING For the BUDG and CONT committees Policy Department for Budgetary Affairs Authors: Camille SIMOES and Rita CALATOZZOLO Directorate-General for Internal Policies PE 660.058 - October 2020 EN EU Gender budgeting: where do we stand? Gender budgeting has a fundamental impact on inclusive and economic growth, fostering employment, reducing poverty, addressing ageing population and increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to the study 1 of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), the estimated impact of improved gender equality varies considerably across member states from 4% to 12% of GDP, depending on the present level of achievement of gender equality. European Union commitment to gender budgeting The European Union (EU) has shown a high-level political and legal commitment to the principles of gender equality and gender mainstreaming. These principles appear, among others, in Arts. 2 2 and 3 3 of the TEU, Art. 8 4 of the TFEU and Art. 23 5 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Member States are also committed to several programmes designed to reduce gender inequality 6 . However, the conclusions of two recent studies conducted by the European Parliament in 2015 and 2017 7 , highlight an insufficient application of gender budgeting in practice and the absence of progress in terms of gender- budgeting between 2015 and 2017. * In 2019, the annual budget suffers from inconsistencies between different chapters as to whether, and to what extent, the principle of gender equality is observed. 1 Economic Benefits of Gender Equality in the European Union, 2017, EIGE 2 Treaty on the European Union, Art. 2 :\u201cThe Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom,security and justice without internalfrontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating ofcrime.\u201d 3 Treaty on the European Union, Art. 3: \u201cThe Union shall establish an internal market. (\u2026) It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of thechild.\u201d 4 Treaty on the Functionning of the European Union, Art. 8: \u201dIn all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, betweenmen and women\u201d 5 EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Art. 28 : \u201cEquality between women and men must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work andpay. The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under- represented sex.\u201d 6 See Annexe, Figure 1 and Table 1. 7 European Parliament, Directorate for Internal Policies, Gender responsive EU Budgeting, Update of the study \u2018The EU Budget for Gender Equality\u2019 and review of its conclusions and recommendations (2019), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=IPOL_STU(2019)621801 WHAT IS GENDER BUDGETING ? \u2018Gender-sensitive budgeting\u2019 or \u2018gender budgeting\u2019 means gender mainstreaming of the entire budgetary process with a view to incorporating a gender equality perspective to all decisions on revenue and expenditure . ",
        "EU Gender budgeting: where do we stand? 2 PE 660.058 * Gender equality is not mentioned in the forthcoming 2021-27 MFF. * The legal basis of EU spending programmes shows a weak and piecemeal commitment to gender equality 8 . * Gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming are not debated in plenary sessions , which is a significant opportunity to make a political case for gender budgeting. * The Juncker Commission never mentioned gender budgeting among key priorities. The room for improvement in the EU Despite the EU budget being smaller than national budgets, the EU \u201cshared management\u201d structure is still likely to have a significant impact on gender budgeting. It is able to influence domestic norms and politics by attaching European gender-equality standards and conditions to EU funds and programmes. The EP 2015 and 2017 studies as well as EIGE Gender Equality Index 2019 identify the inconsistent commitment of Member States to gender equality as one of the main barriers to improvement towards gender equality in the Union (see Box.1). To ensure the efficiency of programmes and policies it is necessary to integrate a systematic and consistent data collection phase in order to monitor and evaluate the commitment and the impact of gender equality. The EP 2015 Study analysed six policy areas having direct and high impacts on gender equality: Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, Home Affairs, Justice, Development and Cooperation, Research and Innovation and Education and Culture. \u2022 The policy area of \u2018Justice\u2019 appears to be the most straightforward area in terms of implications on gender equality. \u2022 In the area of \u2018Home Affairs\u2019, gender equality issues are particularly severe in the field of migration and asylum. 8 See Annexe, Table 1. Box.1 The example of the Europan Social Fund (ESF) Programme (2007-2013) Althrough the ESF helped almost 10 million Europeans to find a job between 2007 and 2014, the Commission ex-post evaluation assesses that Members States have shown irregular commitment to gender-related issues: \u201cin a number of Member States and in some policy themes, there are considerable differences in the gender balance.\u201d Furthermore, the absence of data collection regarding impact of the policies on gender-related issues lead to insignificant outcomes.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Budgetary Affairs PE 660.058 3 However, since gender budgeting is not recognized as a fundamental policy objective these policy areas still don\u2019t significantly impact gender-related issues. Given its complex societal dimensions gender equality often falls into the scope of various policies and competes with other policy objectives to secure funding, meaning budgetary accountability is impeded. In particular, several policy objectives in the Justice chapter are combined in umbrella budget items for EU funding. An example of the Daphne III Programme points out the importance of addressing gender-related issues (see Box. 2). Recommendations As a positive development, the EIGE and the OECD has conducted several studies 9 providing a valuable source of knowledge and expertise that could inform about the implementation of gender budgeting in the EU. Recommendations developed by studies focused on gender budgeting are as follows: \u2022 The EU\u2019s macro-political level commitment to gender equality and gender mainstreaming should be reflected in the drafting and implementation of the EU budget and pursued at the micro-political level for all policies that receive funding from the EU budget. \u2022 Particularly in cross-cutting issues that fall within the remit of several budget titles, it is essential to pursue gender equality objectives and fulfil gender mainstreaming in all budget titles . In order to increase the transparency of the budget, specific amounts allocated to individual actions and policy objectives should be specified in the budget. \u2022 In all actions financed by the EU budget, gender- specific indicators should be adopted and applied in the project selection, monitoring and evaluation phases. In order to ensure financial accountability and transparency, the data should be made available to the public. \u2022 In the light of the EU budgetary and legislative processes, these recommendations require the commitment of several actors involved in the process to gender equality (see Box. 3) . The European Commission (EC) should screen the legal bases of the budget titles analysed in this report to make sure that gender equality and gender mainstreaming are recognised horizontally in the titles and in the rest of the budget. In titles where gender equality and mainstreaming are not embedded in the legislative framework, the EC should start the legislative process with a view to amending the legislation in question to address this deficit. \u2022 When drafting their individual budgets, EU institutions and bodies should clarify the potential gender equality impacts of their spending decisions (such as budget tagging 10 see Box. 4). They should also 9 See Annex, Figure 1. - I am afraid Figure 2 is missing in the annex. 10 OECD study \u201cDesign and implementing gender budgeting - a path to action\u201d (2020 ), \u201cBudget tagging is one way through which governments can make public the resource flows targeted to different government objectives, such as gender equality (...) tracking the level of resources allocated in Box.2 The example of Daphne III Programme (2007 - 2018) Daphne III Programme was a highly successful flagship EU programme tackling gender-based violence designed in the context of the \u2018Rights, Equality and Citizenship\u2019 programme of the Justice policy. To raise funds, Daphne III policy objectives were mixed with other diverse and distinct policy objectives, including the protection of personal data, the protection of the rights of the child and the empowerment of consumers. It raised accountability and transparency problems as there was no indication how resources had been used. ",
        "EU Gender budgeting: where do we stand? 4 PE 660.058 specify target groups of beneficiaries , and participants of their actions, on the basis of gender as well as other intersectional characteristics (such as race, economic class, migration status, religious background and LGBT status) which might potentially cause discrimination or inequalities in the implementation of the specific policy in question. A specific gender equality objective should be defined for each budgetary item. In conclusion, several EU policies and programmes designed to address gender-related issues have not significantly impacted gender inequalities thus far. Since the early 2000\u2019s, numerous studies have suggested methodological tools to implement gender budgeting more efficiently. support of gender equality provides the public with an indication of the degree to which gender considerations are embedded across different areas of the budget, and howthis changes over time.\u201d Box.3 The Swedish Gender Equality Agency Sweden have been ranking 1st in the EU according to the EIGE Gender Equality Index since 2005 and is a pioneer in terms of gender-equality policies. The Swedish approach systematically includes gender mainstreaming and gender-responsive budgeting in all titles and all level of the decision-making process. To contribute to the effective implementation of the Swedish gender equality policy at all levels, the Swedish Gender Equality Agency was created in 2018. It aims to foster the cooperation of several actors (government agencies, municipality, councils, region, civil society...) and provides various forms of support to analyze the progress, assess the implementation of governmental policies, and participate in the allocation of government grants to different projects.

Italy introduced a gender budgeting monitoring tool in 2016 which aims to track budget expenditure and classify them in the light of their impact on gender equality. Expenditures falls into the following categories : * Neutral expenditures: These have no direct or indirect impact on gender, for example: interest and debt repayments, depreciation, royalties and utilities. * Sensitive expenditures: These relate to measures which have a different impact on men and women, for example, compensation of employees or expenditure on school education. * Expenditure aimed at reducing gender inequalities : These relate to measures directly attributable to, or aimed at, reducing gender inequalities or promoting equal opportunities. For example, women\u2019s entrepreneurship funds, female employment incentives, work-life balance measures. Information on expenditures in each of these categories within line ministries and other public administrations was provided in the Report to Parliament on Gender Budget 2016.
