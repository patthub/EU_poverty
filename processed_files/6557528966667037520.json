Allows MCS authorities to better understand the risks that Mauritania is facing and to include the risk assessment in a national MCS strategy / NPOA-IUU to better target limited national resources. Each national IUU risk assessment will feed into a regional MCS strategy allowing shared resources to be better deployed and managed and understand risks shared between States and how these can be deterred an mitigated against. Objective Reduction in the level of IUU observed / estimated in Mauritania over a five year period. More effective and efficient use of limited national MCS resources, incorporating risk assessment into MCS planning. Better managed fisheries and a desire to increase legal, reported catches towards MSY. Link in with the WARFP Component 2 (Reduction of Illegal Fishing) to reduce IUU Main elements of the project The main elements of the project workplan to enable achievement of the objective(s) would include: \uf0b7 Assessment to risks to fisheries in Mauritania in particular tuna fisheries. \uf0b7 Set up / modification of systems to collect MCS indicator data. \uf0b7 Assessment of Mauritania in relation to key compliance indicators (domestic, national and foreign fleets) \uf0b7 Assessment of national capacity to deter and combat IUU fishing \uf0b7 Clear identification of national priorities, highest risks and requirements to combat these risks.

        "Mauritania national sheet Training and curriculum development - Mauritania Element Description Title Strengthen national level skills and knowledge of SDG 14 SDG Target All SDG 14 Country or Region Mauritania Main challenge(s) or gap(s) which project addresses The short-term nature of funding hinders Mauritania to develop coherent long-term strategies in terms of research and training. The Mauritanian higher education system is not providing training in SDG related topics, which hinders the ability of the country to train a dedicated workforce competent in maritime subjects (notably fisheries science, marine conservation). Combined with a limited level of local education, notably at tertiary level, this lack of high level research is detrimental to the necessary renewal of high-skilled civil servants. Training all the staff needed by 2020 outside Mauritania will be costly and will limit the ability of the country to renew its high- level staff. Objective To strengthen national-level skills and share knowledge of all SDG 14 related targets through development of long-term national curricula in tertiary education and short-term training courses at a national and regional level. Main elements of the project Conduct a needs assessment to identify specific gaps in national personnel skills and experience related to SDG 14 goals. Development of short-term national and regional training plans relevant to SDG 14. Development of long-term national curricula to address specific needs within tertiary education. Conduct short-term national and regional training courses (where applicable) in specific SDG 14 related themes. Implementing Organisation * Due to the lack of a single coordinating authority across SDGs in Mauritania it is recommended that if and when such an authority is given or takes this responsibility that this should also coordinate training of personnel and develop SDG relevant courses.

        "Element Description SDG Target All Country or Region Mauritania (also applicable for Cote d\u2019Ivoire, in a lesser extent Gabon) Main challenge(s) or gap(s) which project addresses In several countries, the implementation of the MDGs were not effective as these goals were not truly operationalised and shared by the entire public sector, nor by the private sector. One of the key elements to ensure the success of the SDGs lies in the ability of countries to involve governmental bodies, private sector and the general public in pursuing the achievement of the various SDG targets. Mauritania has just started to integrate SDG14 targets in its high-level policies and the vulgarisation and operationalization of the various SDG14 targets have still to be implemented in divisions and services. Objective The objective of this project is to develop organisational competence at the ministerial level to coordinate and pilot effectively activities related to the completion of SDG14 targets. This project focuses on organisational development. Main elements of the project The main elements of the project would consist in: \uf0b7 Identifying the team that is going to coordinate the different programmes and actions undertaken to reach the SDG14 targets. This should be done at ministerial cabinet level, involving several ministries (prime mister, fisheries, environment\u2026) to reach a high-level consensus on the team composition and affiliation. This team would then lead the rest of the project. \uf0b7 Training the selected team on several key aspects depending on the existing skillset: ocean governance, meeting facilitation, consensus seeking and strategic planning. \uf0b7 Identifying the government bodies contributing to each SDG14 target, and their potential contributions in terms of actions and programmes: workshops to map potential contributions and gaps \uf0b7 Developing an implementation plan specifying which governmental bodies are responsible for progress for each SDG14 target (actions and budget development, but also reporting planning).

Moreover, the project approach makes it difficult to fund activities that are not easily included in projects: extensive and regular primary data collection (biology, economy\u2026) or for topics outside the scope of the calls for proposals. This has important consequences in terms of long- term research strategy, which is more complex to plan, but also on staff retention.

B ACKGROUND Mauritania is a North African country, surrounded by Morocco (north), Algeria (north- east), Mali (east) and Mauritania on the South. The size of the country is close to 1,030,000 km 2 , with a 700 km long coastline. The population of Mauritania is close to 3.5 million inhabitants. The Mauritanian EEZ is 234,000 km 2 and has with maritime borders with Morocco (North), Cape Verde (West) and Senegal (South) 3 . The Islamic Republic of Mauritania became independent from France in 1960. Mauritania experienced a period of political instability between 2003 and 2009. The governance indicators for the country are close to the average 4 , with an average score of -0.59 over the last 20 years. During that period, Voice & Accountability (-0.89) and Rule of Law (- 0.70) have been the main governance issues for Mauritania and is categorised as one of the Least Developed Countries (Figure 1). Key sectors for Mauritania are mainly extractive: mining (22% of the GDP) and fisheries are important parts of the economy (20% of the GDP) 5 . The recent offshore oil extraction is still in the early stages of development. Currently ranked 157 on 188 for the Human Development Index with a score of 0.513, Mauritania had a GNI per capita of USD$ 1,120 in 2015. 3 CIA Country profile for Mauritania - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/mr.html 4 Governance indicators are standardized to range from -2.5 to 2.5 across countries, with 0 as the average score for all countries. 5 Op cite.

With an EEZ of 234,000 km 2 , Mauritania has a rich fishing zone, hosting several types of fleets, targeting small pelagic species, cephalopods, shrimps and hake. A bilateral agreement with Senegal allows their artisanal fishermen to fish in Mauritanian waters. Several countries have been granted access to the Mauritanian waters through fisheries partnership agreements or private agreements. Other usages of the marine zones include the creation of large marine protected areas (notably Banc d\u2019Arguin) 7 . Mauritania has taken steps to embed some of the SDG 14 targets into its strategies and there is information that show progress such as the implementation of action plans for the environment. However, evaluation on SDG 14 has rated progress as low and issues such as low compliance, ineffective enforcement and limited funding are expected to pose a challenge in making progress with SDG 14. Past evaluations have also indicated that Mauritania might not have the appropriate institutional structures in place to absorb external funding but it remains unclear whether that is still the case. 6 http://info.worldbank.org/governance/WGI/#home 7 https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/report-mauritania-2014_fr.pdf -3 -2 -10123V&A PSNV GE RQ RoL CoC M AU RI TA NIA Min Average Max ",

P ROGRESS ON SDG 14 TARGET Target specific details about SDG 14 are captured in Table 1 while Tables 2 and 3 provide a perspective on challenges that might thwart delivery and mechanisms that could support it, respectively. 2.1. Overview International level At the international level, Mauritania has signed the Rio global environmental conventions (UNFCC, UNCCD, CBD), and has ratified the agreement on Port State measures. Mauritania is a member of the International Organisation of La Francophonie. The Francophonie is implementing a specific initiative called the institut de la francophonie pour le de\u0301veloppement durable (IFDD), which notably helps member countries to integrate SDGs in their national policies and strategies, but also fosters capacity building. Mauritania is listed as partner in several international initiatives aiming at improving its profile for several SDGs: \uf0b7 Fostering the conservation and sustainable use of marine Biological Diversity through the International Climate Initiative (IKI) (SDG 14); \uf0b7 Promoting the International Partnership for Expanding Waste Management Services of Local Authorities (IPLA) (SDG 11 and 12); and \uf0b7 100 Million Trees by 2017 (SDG 4, 13, 15, 16 and 17). Regional level At the regional level, Mauritania is participating in several RFMOs: \uf0b7 ICCAT; \uf0b7 Sub regional fisheries commission (SFRC); \uf0b7 Ministerial Conference on Fisheries Cooperation among African States bordering the Atlantic Ocean (ATLAFCO); and \uf0b7 Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF). Most of these RFMOs push for the adoption of targets linked to SDG 14 at the regional and national levels. The ATLAFCO was for example co-organizing a side event at the Ocean Conference held in New York in June 2017 on \u201cAfrica in action for fisheries and aquaculture facing climate change issues\u201d 8 . Most of the activities developed by these RFMOs are linked to the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, which would notably improve the status of targets 14.4 and 14.7. Some RFMOs\u2019 activities are also contributing to the reduction of IUU fishing (target 14.6) and the development of scientific knowledge (target 14.a). Mauritania is a member of the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD), a regional organization aiming at strengthening the economic cooperation between African states. Mauritania has recently joined the Abidjan Convention (2012). The country is part of the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem project (CCLME) funded by GEF. This project is part of the Abidjan Convention and aims at improving transboundary 8 http://www.comhafat.org/fr/actualites.php?id=54 ",
        "Page 4 cooperation on sustainability issues, notably improving sustainability levels of fisheries resources (participating in the achievement of targets 14.4 and 14.7) and improving the protection of vital ecosystems (targets 14.2, 14.5) 9 . National level At the national level, Mauritania is developing 15-year-long strategy plans to foster the country development. From 2001 to 2015, the focus was on the reduction of poverty (Cadre strate\u0301gique de lutte contre la pauvrete\u0301 CSLP 2001-2015). Mauritania is currently developing and implementing its new national \u201cStrategy for accelerated growth and shared prosperity\u201d (Strat\u00e9gie de Croissance Acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e et de Prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 Partag\u00e9e - SCAPP). At the beginning of 2017, several workshops have been organized to evaluate how the SDGs could be incorporated in the strategy. The most recent version of the SCAPP mentions only two SDG14 targets that are aligned with targets 14.4 and 14.5. There is no indication that the other targets have been integrated in any national strategy at this stage. Beginning in the early 2000s, Mauritania has launched several initiatives following the recommendation of Action 21 and of the Johannesburg action plan. A National Council for the Environment and the Development was created, followed by the definition of a National Strategy for the Sustainable Development (Strate\u0301gie nationale de de\u0301veloppement durable, SNDD) and an Action Plan for the Environment (Plan d\u2019action national pour l\u2019environnement, PANE) in 2006. The National Strategy for the Sustainable Development is defined following five main axes 10 : \uf0b7 Reinforcement of institutional and political capacity to effectively manage the environment and natural resources; \uf0b7 Promotion of the sustainable access to basic services as a strategic means of combating poverty; \uf0b7 Promotion of integrated and participatory management at all levels for the efficient use of natural resources; \uf0b7 Management of the local and global environment in accordance with Mauritanian commitments under international conventions; and \uf0b7 Development of funding mechanisms for the National Plan of Action for Environment and Sustainable Development. Since the launch of the SNDD, two Action Plans for the Environment have been implemented. The second plan which was running from 2012 to 2016 was focusing on 8 thematic axes and 7 transversal axes. Transversal axes are focused on processes (Legal framework, Institutional reform, Environmental evaluations etc.) while the thematic axes focus on specific aspects of the Mauritanian environment, some of which are more relevant for the completion of SDG14, notably: \uf0b7 Axis I focusing on the sustainable management of natural resources, notably marine resources; \uf0b7 Axis IV dedicated to coastal management; and \uf0b7 Axis VIII dealing with pollutions and risks. 9 http://www.fao.org/in-action/canary-current-lme/background/the-cclme-project/en/ 10 http://www.environnement.gov.mr/fr/images/pdf/sndd.pdf ",
        "International Oceans Governance - Scientific Support Mauritania Literature Review Page 5 Mauritania has also developed a Strategy a National Action Plan for the Biodiversity 2011-2020 11 , in order to \u201cmaintain ecosystem functions and their capacity for adaptation and evolution\u201d. The strategy focuses on land-based resources, but also on coastal and marine resources. Fourteen objectives are formulated in the Action Plan, some of which are of interest for the progress of SDG14: \uf0b7 Objective 4: \u201cPreserving and restoring ecosystems and their functioning\u201d, which is the base for developing a network of protected areas, notably marine protected areas; \uf0b7 Objective 8: \u201cEnsuring the sustainability of the use of biological resources\u201d; and \uf0b7 Objective 12: \u201cDeveloping research, analysis, sharing and dissemination of knowledge\u201d. In terms of fisheries management, Mauritania is implementing a \u201cNational management strategy for the sustainable development of fisheries and the maritime economy 2015- 2019\u201d 12 which aims at improving the status of Mauritanian resources. The plan focuses on research activities, governance reinforcement but aims also at improving the integration of the fishing sector in the Mauritanian economy, by the development of port infrastructures and the emergence of a processing sector able to absorb a part of the catch coming from Mauritanian waters. 2.2. Progress with MDGs Mauritania approached the MDGs under the poverty reduction angle which was seen as a priority between 2015-2030 13 . The progress report for 2010 (which is the last available) shows that Mauritania reported little progress on objectives that are of interest for SDG14: MDG7 (Sustainable environment) is reported with limited progress, although it seems that the surface of the Banc d\u2019Arguin was not counted in the protected areas (which would have improved the value of the target 7.B), while some progress has been achieved on MSG1 (Poverty and Hunger reduction). The national report on sustainable development for 2012 14 summarises the progress made by Mauritania 20 years after the Rio Conference. Notably, it describes all the strategies and plans developed by Mauritania to improve the status of the environment on its territory. One of the main results is the development of important marine protected areas in Mauritanian waters (notably the banc d\u2019Arguin). However, several weaknesses were identified in the report, some of which remain unresolved in 2017: \uf0b7 weak governance; \uf0b7 weak redistribution in the national economy; \uf0b7 the strong dependence on the outside world and its vulnerability to external shocks; \uf0b7 lack of competitiveness of the private sector; \uf0b7 limited capacity to absorb external aid; \uf0b7 inadequacies in the infrastructure supporting growth; \uf0b7 continued degradation of the environment and natural resources. 11 https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/mr/mr-nbsap-v2-fr.pdf 12 http://www.peches.gov.mr/IMG/pdf/strategie_mpem_fr.pdf 13 http://www.agenda2030.com.br/biblioteca/SDGs-are-Coming-to-Life-UNDG.pdf 14 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/1027mauritania.pdf ",

This is based on a specific methodology using indicators slightly different from the SDG targets defined at the UN level. Comparability and availability of data for a vast majority of countries are the main drivers for this specific method. The report ranks progress at SDG 14 as low. SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) is amongst the highest ranked: all indicators for waste and emissions are very low (SDG 12), but there is almost no wastewater treatment in Mauritania which may cause some issues of coastal pollution (potential eutrophication - target 14.1). Poverty levels are currently close to the goal, with however a slow progression towards the objective of Zero Poverty by 2030 (SDG 1 - no poverty). With exception to the obesity index, all indicators show that Mauritania is far from reaching the target of Zero Hunger (SDG 2), with an important prevalence of stunting and a weak level of cereal yield (SDG 2). Mauritania is also not achieving the \u201cDecent work and economic growth\u201d goal (SDG 8) with a negative adjusted GDP growth, an important level of child labour and an important level of unemployment. 15 http://www.sdgindex.org/assets/files/2017/2017-SDG-Index-and-Dashboards-Report--regions.pdf ",

        "Page 20 1 I NTRODUCTION The main objective of this series of SWOT analyses is to obtain information about the capacities and the limitations that are currently faced by each of the countries in the study in being able to address their SDG14 requirements. In a standard SWOT analysis (strengths weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) internal (S&W) and external (O&T) factors (to the country in this case) are analysed. The internal scope (strengths and weaknesses) are those related to the organisations, projects and structures of the country; the external scope (opportunities and threats) are those events and pressures that influence the country from outside but can much it easier (opportunities) or make it more difficult or prevent a country from achieving its objectives (threats). Once the four elements: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats have been analysed individually (Section 0), some key underlying mechanisms may be determined to utilise strengths and opportunities individually or to address and counter weaknesses and threats. However, it is usually necessary to further analyse the relationships between the four components to identify potential ways forward and then to set strategies to follow in order to take advantage of our strengths based on specific opportunities and to reduce threats, and to work to combat any identified weaknesses by identifying opportunities and to highlight where weaknesses and threats coincide so measures can be taken to reduce the potential negative impacts.

A summary of the analysis can be found in Table 1, with the details found for each specific section in for Strengths (Section 3.1 - Mauritania demonstrates a strong political commitment for sustainable development, and has implemented a \u2018Strategy for accelerated growth and shared prosperity\u2019 taking into account several aspects of SDG14. Mauritanian fisheries are an important sector for the government administration and are consistently financed compared with other departments, which has meant over recent years several measures have been adopted to improve the fisheries management framework. Focus on fisheries has also resulted in the establishment of a number of mixed protected areas since 1980, while also encouraging the Mauritanian government to be one of the first to participate in FiTIs. The country has good connections with overseas tertiary training which has resulted in Mauritanian researchers working for the national institute being well trained and well connected. ",
        "Page 22 Table 2), Weaknesses (Section 0- Table 3), Opportunities (Section 0 - Opportunities detail any external improvement that can be taken advantage of by a country. Opportunities should be external to the country. Opportunities are a combination of different circumstances at a given time that offer a positive outcome, if they can be effectively and efficiently taken advantage of. As opportunities are external, a country cannot easily \u2018create\u2019 opportunities, they can only ensure that they are in the best position to gain the maximum benefit from any opportunities that appear, i.e. have the governmental structures in place.Mauritania have recently applied for an extension of its EEZ offering opportunities to increase the capacity of its seabed resources. Regional dynamics is important, with several organisations having a long history of fostering regional cooperation among countries with fisheries related interest. There is a strong presence of NGOs and a continuous level of intergovernmental support within the area providing new external funding and project opportunities to Mauritania. Externally funded programmes such as WAEMU and GO WAMER are available, encouraging environmental data collection as well as shared MCS resources and regional MCS exercises. Economically speaking, oil and gas reserves have been identified offering opportunities to develop the offshore exploration industry, while available funding for port infrastructure improvements will allow Mauritanian fleet to land catches in better conditions. Table 4) and Threats (Section 0 - Threats are external factor, i.e. originating outside of the country being analysed. No control is exercised by the country over these factors, but there will be a benefit by having contingency plans to address them if they should occur to reduce any negative impacts. A typical threat would be \u201cGlobal warming creating negative economic impacts through reduced fishing opportunities and environmental damage\u201d. Fisheries resources extend beyond the Mauritanian EEZ and a large share of small pelagic resources are caught by foreign vessel, implying the need to manage shared resources with neighbouring countries. In addition, illegal fishing is a continuous threat to the country often occurring when vessel licensed to neighbouring countries do not follow EEZ limits. Preventing pollution from close neighbours, namely Senegal and Mali, is difficult and common waters can result in Mauritanian resources being damaged by events out of their control, thus supporting the need for shared management of marine resources. Climate change could greatly impact the Mauritanian coast, increasing the frequency of storms, raising SST with a direct effect on numerous marine resources. Due to high dependence on fuel prices, any global economic downturns could have a negative impact to Mauritania\u2019s economic stability. Table 5).

Each element identified is given a unique number for future reference, fully described and evidence given. 3.1 Strengths Strengths can be described as a country\u2019s internal positive attributes that makes a country stand out from others. Strengths could include attributes such as a defined national focus on a particular key issue, strong academic infrastructure that can underpin research, good long-term funding for relevant government bodies etc. For example, a country may only have a single national university but if that university has a strong oceanographic or marine biology focus with strong internationally renowned research groups that would be a key strength in developing mechanisms and analysing data to enable a country to meet its SDG targets. Mauritania demonstrates a strong political commitment for sustainable development, and has implemented a \u2018Strategy for accelerated growth and shared prosperity\u2019 taking into account several aspects of SDG14.

        "# SDG Target Strength Description and evidence 7 14.5 Important network of protected areas The Parc National du Banc d\u2019Arguin is one of the very first and until recently one of the largest protected areas created in Africa. A mixed protected area, its functioning is based on a participatory approach involving local populations with the park administration and the national authorities. Several other mixed protected areas (terrestrial/marine) have been created since the 1980s. 8 14.a Tertiary training overseas (notably in Africa and Europe) University-level training focusing on SDG related subjects are not covered by Mauritanian universities. Specific maritime training is pursued overseas, mainly in Europe and Africa. This allows civil servants and researchers to bond with international colleagues, offering the ability to extend the national networks. 9 14.6 Part of the FiTIs Mauritania is one of the first countries to join the Fisheries Transparency Initiative, which aims at combatting IUU fishing.

        "Page 28 3.2 Weaknesses Weaknesses stop a country from performing at its optimum level. Weaknesses are highlighted as areas or attributes that can be improved to enable the country to improve in particular areas for example a lack of political will to implement changes, reduced administrative or enforcement capacity that can reduce effectiveness. Overall, the fragmentation of Mauritania\u2019s national strategy and restricted fisheries administration resources has resulted in difficulties developing and implementing new management plans. Additionally, limited MCS resource capacity and a large EEZ has left the country vulnerable to a number of IUU activities, particularly artisanal fisherman not abiding to legislation in protected areas, and influxes of large numbers of unlicensed vessels from Senegal. Primary and secondary academic infrastructure are perfectible in Mauritania, while tertiary level SDG education is limited which hinders the ability of the country to develop a dedicated workface in maritime subjects. As a result, data on fisheries is limited with little information on stocks levels and impacts of new measures being unavailable, while access to existing data is difficult to obtain. Table 3: Summary of Weaknesses Identified for Mauritania. # SDG Target Weakness Description and evidence 1 14.6 14.4 14.5 Large EEZ with limited enforcement capacity, despite recent progress. The Mauritanian EEZ is quite large and MCS resources are limited, which poses the risk of IUU fishing either from artisanal fishermen not applying specific rules in coastal zones and protected areas (national parks and protected zones) but also large-scale vessels entering the EEZ without licence. 2 All 14.a Limited local tertiary level education in SDG related skills. The Mauritanian higher education system is not providing training in SDG related topics, which hinders the ability of the country to train a dedicated workforce competent in maritime subjects (notably fisheries science, marine conservation). The ISSM (Institut Sup\u00e9rieur des Sciences de la Mer) has recently opened a licence level programs to train civil servants. 3 14.4 14.5 Fisheries administration is lacking resources to develop and implement management plans. Management plans for key resources are designed jointly by the fisheries administration and the Mauritanian research community (IMROP). But these plans are not implemented, mainly due to a lack of funds and dedicated staff. 4 All SDGs are a distant object for an important share of the civil service The different SDGs have been integrated in some high-level policy documents, such as the national strategy (SCADD), but they have not yet been adopted and integrated in the different administrations. The process of identification and operationalisation of SDG14 targets is expected to improve this situation. 5 All Fragmentation There is no single national strategy for reaching SDG14 targets, as several governmental bodies will be involved in developing tasks to reach specific targets. Implementing effective coordination mechanisms is essential to maintain a cohesive approach of SDG14 topics and will be one of the key factor for Mauritania\u2019s success in achieving SDG14 targets. ",
        "# SDG Target Weakness Description and evidence 6 All Civil service workforce is ageing It has been mentioned that an important part of the civil service workforce is close to retirement age, with a potential recruitment gap around 2020. 7 14.6 14.7 14.b Fisheries data are limited. Fisheries data collected in Mauritania present some limitations: limited economic information on vessels profitability, limited information on some species landed. This lowers the ability of Mauritania researchers to perform relevant evaluations (stock evaluations), but also forbid to evaluate the socio-economic impacts of new measures (implementation of protected zones, evaluation of new coastal developments\u2026) 8 14.7 14.b Ageing fleet The Mauritanian fleet is ageing, notably the industrial fleet. This has led to some capacity leaving the fleet. Profit levels seem not sufficient for vessel owners to finance the fleet renewal. 9 14.7 14.b Weak processing sector Processing sector is not well developed in Mauritania, which may hinder the potential profit generation of the Mauritanian fisheries sector. 10 14.7 14.b Most of small-scale fishermen are not Mauritanian nationals Coastal fisheries are performed by fishing communities that are not from Mauritanian origins. Senegalese nomadic fishermen are entering the Mauritanian waters under a bilateral agreement between Mauritania and Senegal. 11 All Access to existing information Access to information across the environmental and fisheries sectors is not available in the public domain and is not easy to acquire even within the sector. 12 all Primary and secondary academic infrastructure are perfectible Primary and elementary schooling systems are perfectible in Mauritania. Literacy rates for under 25 years old is low compared (71% for young men, 66%for young women), improving however slightly the overall literacy rate (which is just below 60% at the national level). 3.3 Opportunities Opportunities detail any external improvement that can be taken advantage of by a country. Opportunities should be external to the country. Opportunities are a combination of different circumstances at a given time that offer a positive outcome, if they can be effectively and efficiently taken advantage of. As opportunities are external, a country cannot easily \u2018create\u2019 opportunities, they can only ensure that they are in the best position to gain the maximum benefit from any opportunities that appear, i.e. have the governmental structures in place.Mauritania have recently applied for an extension of its EEZ offering opportunities to increase the capacity of its seabed resources. Regional dynamics is important, with several organisations having a long history of fostering regional cooperation among countries with fisheries related interest.

Economically speaking, oil and gas reserves have been identified offering opportunities to develop the offshore exploration industry, while available funding for port infrastructure improvements will allow Mauritanian fleet to land catches in better conditions. Table 4: Summary of Opportunities Identified for Mauritania. # SDG Target Opportunity Description and evidence 1 14.4 14.5 Shared fisheries MCS The potential for using shared MCS resources between neighbouring States is a great opportunity. The MCS patrols initiated under the GO WAMER project have been a great success. 2 All 14.a External training (tertiary level) The lack of local tertiary education led Mauritania to send an important share of its researchers and civil servants to be trained notably in Europe or Canada, with the aid of development funding (French development agency notably). This has allowed Mauritanian researchers and civil servants to be well trained but also to develop international connections with researchers and civil servants from the sub region and from international research teams. 3 All Strong NGO / Intergovernmental support and pressure (MAVA/ UICN / UNDP.) The continuous presence of NGOs (UICN, MAVA) and intergovernmental agencies (UNDP and FAO notably) provide support and funding to Mauritania external to other sources. 4 14.5 Biodiversity in the Mauritanian waters Mauritanian waters are feeding grounds (sometimes nursing grounds) for several populations of cetacean species (whales, dolphins) and some Mauritanian beaches are nesting grounds for important turtle populations. The different protected areas are also hosting numerous populations of migratory birds. 5 All Regional dynamic is important (notably SFRC, WAEMU) Several regional organisations have a long history to foster cooperation among countries on fisheries related subjects. The SFRC focuses on fisheries management, helping notably to maintain the coherence between different countries fishing policies. Economic integration at the WAEMU level is also an important factor to foster better regional cooperation on the development of coherent maritime policies. 6 All Structuring projects at the regional levels on specific subjects: data collection (WAEMU), surveillance (GO WAMER). Important projects have helped fostering regional cooperation. The WAEMU has pushed for a joint effort in establishing a fisheries data collection system which would allow to better understand the effect of management on coastal fleets but also to foster the adoption of regional measures. The EU funded project called GO Wamer has been used as an umbrella for several local projects, and notably the development of a regional MCS exercise. 7 All Access to external experts (IRD, IUCN etc.) Mauritania has a long history of visiting researchers, from European and North American research centres.

        "Page 32 3.4 Threats Threats are external factor, i.e. originating outside of the country being analysed. No control is exercised by the country over these factors, but there will be a benefit by having contingency plans to address them if they should occur to reduce any negative impacts. A typical threat would be \u201cGlobal warming creating negative economic impacts through reduced fishing opportunities and environmental damage\u201d. Fisheries resources extend beyond the Mauritanian EEZ and a large share of small pelagic resources are caught by foreign vessel, implying the need to manage shared resources with neighbouring countries. In addition, illegal fishing is a continuous threat to the country often occurring when vessel licensed to neighbouring countries do not follow EEZ limits. Preventing pollution from close neighbours, namely Senegal and Mali, is difficult and common waters can result in Mauritanian resources being damaged by events out of their control, thus supporting the need for shared management of marine resources. Climate change could greatly impact the Mauritanian coast, increasing the frequency of storms, raising SST with a direct effect on numerous marine resources. Due to high dependence on fuel prices, any global economic downturns could have a negative impact to Mauritania\u2019s economic stability. Table 5: Summary of Threats Identified for Mauritania. # SDG Targe t Threat Description and evidence 1 14.4 14.5 14.a Shared fisheries resources with neighbouring countries. Fishing resources extend beyond the Mauritanian EEZ, implying the need to manage shared resources with neighbouring countries (notably Morocco, Senegal and Cape Verde). There are also scientific uncertainties around the delimitation of fish stocks, notably for hake and small pelagic fish: there are currently research (notably in the EU funded project H2020 Farfish) about stock delineation to assess the unicity of stocks in the sub- region or the existence of sub-stocks that could be managed individually. 2 14.4 14.6 14.b A large share of the small pelagic resources is caught by foreign vessels In recent years, small pelagic species represented close to 2/3 of the production in Mauritanian waters. A large share of these pelagic resources is caught by foreign vessels (89%), with very limited processing happening in which limits the benefit Mauritania can extract from the exploitation of its resources. 3 14.1 14.2 Common waters \u2013 pollution sources external to Mauritania Mauritania do not control the pollution generated by some of its close neighbours along the Senegal river (Senegal and Mali). may generate terrestrial pollutions that ultimately drift in Mauritanian waters, lowering the quality of marine environment. 4 All 14.a 14.5 14.4 Short-term nature of external funding does not allow to develop a long-term coherent strategy. The short nature of funding does not allow to develop coherent multiannual strategies. This has been highlighted for the fisheries research but also for also for policy development and conservation work. 5 14.4 14.5 14.7 14.b Illegal fishing IUU fishing is a threat for the country, due to the large EEZ Mauritania have to control with limited resources. IUU may also happen when vessels licenced to fish in neighbouring countries do not follow the EEZ limits. ",
        "# SDG Targe t Threat Description and evidence 6 14.2 14.3 14.5 14.7 14.b Climate change Climate change could greatly impact the Mauritanian coast, by increasing the frequency of strong storms, raising the sea level and modifying the sea surface temperature with a direct effect on numerous marine resources. Coastal fisheries would suffer greatly from a shrink of potential nurseries and recruitment areas, or from the displacement of pelagic resources due to changes in water temperatures (evolution on the temperature front with an important impact on the Sardinella fishery for example). 7 14.1 14.2 14.4 Offshore oil and natural gas exploitation Offshore oil and natural gas exploration have been highlighted as opportunities. They can be a threat as there are doubts that effective environmental compliance monitoring programmes is put in place to ensure development does not have a negative impact, notably in terms of pollutions. Moreover, the different exploitation zones are situated in important fishing zones. 8 14.7 Economic \u2013 Global economic downturn. Global economic down-turn could impact the Mauritanian economy, due to its high dependence on fuel prices. 9 14.4 14.5 Nomadic fishermen from neighbouring countries Some Senegalese nomadic fishermen were authorised to fish in Mauritanian waters, under a bilateral agreement in place since 1983. Due to a recent change in Mauritanian law (obligation to land in Mauritania the catch performed in Mauritanian waters), the agreement is currently not active. Some of the Senegalese fishermen were reported using forbidden gears (smaller mesh sizes) and entering protected areas without proper authorization. According to some interviewees there may still be some cases of Senegalese vessels entering the Mauritanian waters without a proper licence. 10 All Civil service workforce is ageing It has been mentioned that an important part of the civil service workforce is close to retirement age, with a potential recruitment gap around 2020. This will have an important impact on the ability of Mauritania to implement the different plans and strategies tha have been drafted in recent years. 4 SWOT L EVEL 2 C OMBINATIONS In this second level of the SWOT analysis the Strengths and Weaknesses are linked to the Opportunities and Threats for Mauritania. This will identify and gaps and needs in Mauritania, by identifying where existing strengths could be used to plug gaps, i.e. using existing national experience and organisations to address a gap.

These \u201cnatural opportunities\u201d are those that a country should be able to take advantage of easily due to their existing strengths. These should present the greatest return on investment (based on money or time) as they are likely to be quickest and easiest to implement. These should justify immediate planning or assessment of feasibility. These combinations are most likely to succeed and generate good practice examples due to the matching of a country\u2019s strengths and opportunities. When these areas have not already being highlighted, then it is recommended that they are planned for with a national planning structure and prioritised, i.e. there is a need to adjust focus and reprioritise. The high level of training of Mauritanian researchers and the prospect of reviving the Rafismer network has been identified as a natural opportunity in Mauritania. Hence, the country could benefit from a West African movement to reinforce and consolidate this currently dormant network.

Shared fisheries MCS Work developed under the SFRC umbrella or during the Go WAMER project on joint MCS work are good example of surveillance projects that can deliver effective results on tackling IUU fishing at the regional level. A regional programme for joint MCS activities should be implemented, which would partly disconnect these operations from the funding issues projects like Go WAMER are facing. 2 Mauritanian researchers are well trained External training (tertiary level) Mauritania should take profit of the available solutions of external training that covers the capacity gaps related to SDG 14. Where possible SFPA funding should be included to address training to provide scientific support for the achievement of SDG targets. 3 Conservation Trust Fund Bacomab Strong NGO / Intergovernmental support and pressure (MAVA/ UICN / UNDP) NGO pressure should be used at the regional level to show the benefit of implementing Conservation Trust Funds for countries experiencing the same short-term funding issues. 4 Conservation Trust Fund Bacomab Biodiversity in the Mauritanian waters It is important for Mauritania to maintain the dynamic initiated by the implementation of the Bacomab trust fund, notably by identifying biodiversity hotspots that could be integrated in the network of conservation and protected areas developed along 5 Important network of protected areas ",

It is essential to maintain the financial effort on infrastructure development (storage units, processing plants) for improving the value added generated by fisheries operated in Mauritanian waters. This is already the case in Nouadhibou and Nouakchott developments, but other landing points are in need of infrastructure compatible with the requirements to export the European market. 10 Improvement of the fisheries management framework Structuring projects at the regional levels on specific subjects: data collection (WAEMU), surveillance (GO WAMER). Mauritania should ensure that good practices identified during regional projects are not lost and integrated in national legislation and/or programmes. There is also a need to maximize the return on investment these projects could generate in terms of capacity building for the Mauritanian administration. 11 Mauritanian researchers are well trained Rafismer The revival of the Rafismer network should be used as an important vector of regional cooperation, notably on SDG14s subjects. Mauritania could be one of the countries pushing for the consolidation of this network which has been dormant in recent years. ",

For many existing threats the current skills, funding and administrative requirements may already be in place to be able to meet these threats e.g. financial planning to ensure lean periods can be managed without having to resort to laying off of staff, cutting back on research programmers etc. Many threats are often not recognised as they have been countered effectively by standard procedures that are reviewed on a regular basis. Good practice can be developed to show how to effectively address threats in limited situation. Table 7: Summary of Strength and Threat Combinations Identified for Mauritania. # Strength Threat Description and evidence 1 Strong political commitment for sustainable development Shared fisheries resources with neighbouring countries. Fisheries revenues are important for the Mauritanian economy. However, reaching sustainable exploitation levels for several stocks There is a strong need for improving regional mechanisms to manage fisheries, either in terms of allocation of fishing rights between various countries, but also in terms of fishing capacity management at the regional level. 2 The Fisheries sector is important for the Mauritanian administration 3 Infrastructures for fish storage and processing are improving A large share of the small pelagic resources is caught by foreign vessels A recent legal change implicates that all fish caught in the Mauritanian waters have to be landed in Mauritanian ports. To maximise the value generated by this new supply if fish there is a strong need for improving the processing infrastructure. 4 Bacomab Conservation Trust Fund Short term nature of funding The creation of the Bacomab conservation trust fund has been instrumental to minimize the volatility of funding devoted to the development of MPAs work to avoid the heavily reliance on short term funding schemes. Mauritania should play a key role in helping other countries to develop such funding mechanism either at a national level or at a regional level. This would insure MPA managers to access stable funding to develop medium to long-term conservation programmes. 5 Part of the FiTI Illegal fishing It is essential for Mauritania to build on any opportunity to develop effective measures to combat IUU vessels. Building on the FiTI membership may be a good option for Mauritania to access valuable information about IUU vessels that may operate in its waters. ",
        "# Strength Threat Description and evidence 6 Important network of protected areas Climate change Monitoring and protecting specific vulnerable areas, notably in coastal areas, are some of the actions Mauritania can take to adapt its marine sector to climate change (notably coastal erosion and loss of biodiversity). 7 Important network of protected areas Offshore oil and natural gas exploitation Some of the exploitation blocks are situated quite close to the coastline and close to some MPAs (notably the Banc d\u2019Arguin). Special attention should be drawn on the environmental impact assessment of new exploitations but also on the mitigation measures developed by the oil companies to avoid pollution, even at low levels, which would be devastating for the water quality and the protected biotopes. 8 Infrastructures for fish storage and processing are improving Economic \u2013 Global economic downturn. Fish products are quickly exported, without a lot of processing taking place in Mauritania. The development of storage and processing units in the country will help improve the value generated by the Mauritanian sector, which would increase the resilience of the sector in case of a future global economic downturn. 9 Infrastructures for fish storage and processing are improving Eutrophication of rivers and some coastal areas The development of fish processing infrastructure has to be supported by specific effluent treatments to avoid the release of grey waters that would degrade the water quality in coastal waters. 4.3 Weaknesses and Opportunities \u2013 \u201cAttractive Opportunities\u201d Where a national weakness has been identified but an opportunity exists these can be potentially attractive options in being able to plug a gap in funding, skills or experience. These opportunities are likely to produce good returns if the basic level of capability and implementation are viable. This could be in the form of funding and bringing in experience to enhance the skills of staff to add long-term skill capacity to a research organisation along with necessary technical equipment, e.g. Training course on otolith reading along with microscopes and otolith staining materials to remove the reliance on expensive external laboratories. Good practice examples in these cases may come from addressing current weaknesses turning those weaknesses into strengths. If weaknesses are not being addressed and opportunities exist it should be identified what is stopping or limiting progress on implementation, are assumptions correct and are plans realistic and substantial or are other weaknesses limiting the chances of exploiting opportunities e.g. poor government effectiveness limiting the ability of government research agencies to apply for and win external funding.

Some specific short courses focusing on Ocean Governance topics could be interesting for civil servants having already completed a master or a PhD 22 . There is however a gap to be filled by francophone universities as most of these courses are help in English, which may be an issue for a country like Mauritania. 2 Large EEZ with limited enforcement capacity, despite recent progress.

Regional dynamic is important (notably SFRC, WAEMU) Mauritania on its own cannot build effective management frameworks for all shared stocks without developing convergent systems with its neighbours. There is a strong need for improving regional mechanisms to manage fisheries, either in terms of allocation of fishing rights between various countries, but also in terms of fishing capacity management at the regional level.

Investments in ports infrastructure are essential to raise the profile of the Mauritanian processing sector, which is currently happening in major ports (Nouadhibou, Nouakchott).

In these cases the assessment of risk is crucial. It is very important to understand the risks faces and ignorance of those risks is a poor state to be in. Where risks and potential impacts are shown to be low then we should highlight these issues as a low priority and ensure that countries are not distracted by them, but where the risks and / or the impacts are high then it is recommended that an assessment of funding and capability gaps is conducted and a mitigation plan developed to ensure these risks are addressed. This could be through additional funding, training, bringing in additional temporary technical assistance, or working with neighbouring States to transfer skills, personnel or equipment (e.g. rent of a patrol vessel during \u201chigh\u201d season in one EEZ during the \u201clow\u201d season in the vessel owners\u2019 EEZ) or joint purchasing and usage of high value resources. The Country\u2019s large EEZ, limited MCS capacity and threat of illegal fishing have been highlighted as high risk scenario in Mauritania. Thus, a science and evidence based national IUU risk assessment should be conducted as part of its MCS strategy to identify high risk areas and mitigate future risk.

Shared fisheries resources with neighbouring countries. Some of the fish stocks present in Mauritanian waters are shared with several neighbouring countries; calling for a common approach to manage them. There is currently no control on the implementation of the COPACE resolutions (which are non-binding), no allocation of stock shares (or effort), nor a real control of the effort deployed by African fleets. There is however the need for the development of an effective management mechanism at the regional level, which could vastly improve the status of several stocks, notably by fostering the development of converging management systems. 2 A large share of the small pelagic resources is caught by foreign vessels 3 Large EEZ with limited enforcement capacity, despite recent progress. Illegal fishing There is a strong need for developing evidence based risk assessment to identify high risk situations (specific areas, risk fleets\u2026), in order to maximise the impact of the available MCS resources. There is also a need for developing a regional approach to tackle the issue of IUU vessels spreading over several EEZ. 4 Primary and secondary academic infrastructure are perfectible Short term nature of funding The short-term nature of funding hinders Mauritania to develop coherent long-term strategies in terms of research and training. Combined with a limited level of local education, notably at tertiary level, this lack of high level research is detrimental to the necessary renewal of high- skilled civil servants. Training all the staff needed by 2020 outside Mauritania will indeed be extremely costly and will limit the ability of the country to renew its high-level staff. 5 Limited local tertiary level education in SDG related skills. 6 Civil service workforce is ageing 7 Fisheries data are limited.
