        "- 1- The Committee of the Regions HAVING REGARD TO its decision of 18 September 1996, pursuant to the fourth paragraph of Article 198 C of the Treaty establishing the European Community, to issue an Opinion on a rural development policy and to direct Commission 8 - Spatial Planning, Agriculture, Hunting, Fisheries, Forestry, Marine Environment and Upland Areas - to prepare the opinion; HAVING REGARD TO the Draft Opinion (CdR 389/96) adopted by Commission 2 on 5 December 1996 (rapporteur: Mr van Gelder) adopted the following opinion at its 16th plenary session on (meeting of 16 January 1997): 1. Introduction 1.1 There is a case for discussing the European Union's rural areas. The pleasant living environment offered by these areas, which account for some 80% of EU territory and are home to approximately 25% of the total population, is seriously threatened by economic developments, not least the ongoing reorganization of the agricultural sector. Particularly in areas with a poor infrastructure, incomes are under heavy pressure, population density is declining and it seems virtually impossible to maintain adequate services. We are witnessing a dramatic downward spiral. There is an urgent need to make rural development a central European policy issue and to work out a strategy or even launch a campaign to develop rural areas. out that In the declaration issued at the Cork conference of November 1996 it was pointed \" sustainable rural development must be put at the top of the agenda of the European Union, and become the fundamental principle which underpins all rural policy in the immediate future and after enlargement. This aims at reversing rural out- migration, combating poverty, stimulating employment and equality of opportunity, and responding to growing requests for more quality, health, safety, personal development and leisure, and improving rural well-being. The need to preserve and improve the quality of the rural environment must be integrated into all Community policies that relate to rural development. There must be a fairer balance of public spending, infrastructure investments and educational, health and communications services between rural and urban areas. A growing share of available resources should be used for promoting rural development and securing environmental objectives. \" CdR 389/96 fin F/NL/HO/CH/ym .../. ",
        "- 3- result of shared land-use planning difficulties affecting regions comprising not just rural areas but also urban areas. The above-mentioned definition is based on the qualitative characteristics of rural areas and embraces the typical diversity of such areas. Furthermore, it is important to note that this definition covers small towns and villages in rural areas. 1.6 A more highly developed rural development policy should be based on a classification of rural areas, not as part of an academic exercise but as a way of helping to develop policy instruments. 2. Economic basis 2.1 The problems affecting rural areas are partly the result of the modern global economic processes. A strong competitive position depends on high productivity, constant innovation and good value for money and these requirements can best be met by concentrating economic activity in densely-populated areas. Such areas possess a large labour force with a variety of skills, a wide range of educational and training facilities' and a dynamic socio-cultural environment which provides a basis for useful contacts, collaboration and innovation. Rural areas, on the other hand, are sparsely populated and lack the large range of facilities on which economic development thrives. The relative backwardness of rural areas can be reduced partly by developing an urban network in suitable areas and partly by pursuing economic activities - and these certainly include the activities of hi-tech companies - which are less dependent on the conditions obtaining in large urban areas, although there will always be some difference in economic conditions. In addition, the problems of rural areas must not be considered from an exclusively socio-economic perspective. The pleasantness and attractiveness of rural areas - to which their economic potential is closely related - derive from their inherent merits including, in particular, the preservation of a distinctive character. 3. Conditions for rural development 3.1 In urban areas, high priority is attached to the creation of optimum conditions for economic development and employment. In the case of rural development, efforts are also directed at creating other conditions which, whilst being beyond dispute per se, can affect economic development prospects. In addition to ensuring that rural areas provide their inhabitants with an adequate income and services, sufficient attention must be paid to the quality of the countryside, the care of the cultural and historical heritage, the retention of social structures, the provision of adequate leisure and tourist facilities, the restoration or preservation of ecological resources and the provision of adequate nationwide systems for producing food, energy, raw materials and, not least, clean water. A principle rural objective is to preserve, or restore, and offer values which have disappeared in large urban areas as a result of mass urbanization and the demands of industrialization. Rural policy should not apply exclusively to peripheral areas. As the European Commissioner for agriculture and rural development pointed out at the Cork Conference \"rural policy is directed at all country areas\". In CdR 389/96 fin F/NL/HO/CH/ym .../... ",
        "- 5- agricultural production for leisure and tourist activities and for preserving an area's cultural and historical heritage and ecological resources. Factors such as the nature of the soil, distance from conurbations, historical development, the local socio-cultural environment and the landscape significantly affect the opportunities available. Every rural area has its own profile and the plans for developing a particular area must always be based on its profile. The EU structural policy for strengthening rural economies and enhancing the quality of life in rural areas must include measures to help not only agriculture but also trade and industry, crafts, the service sector, education and further education, leisure and tourism, the preservation of the cultural heritage and environmental protection. In this context the EU should confine itself to setting out framework provisions and should give the regions sufficient scope to frame their own measures. European or national sectoral policies cannot provide an adequate solution unless they incorporate measures taken at regional level. Policy can no longer be based on support for agriculture alone as the key to regional and economic development. It is even conceivable that, in certain situations, the quality of a region, including its attractiveness and the strengthening of its economic base, could be enhanced by switching to other agricultural activities, such as nature conservation and the stewardship of the countryside (as part of the development of the \"green alliance\"). In principle, therefore, provisions should be drawn up to allow for a socially acceptable thorough restructuring of holdings, where necessary, within the framework of a development plan. 5.2 The future of rural areas depends on all their assets. Rural areas possess an intrinsic value that not only supplements the values that have been lost in urban, industrialized areas but also compensates for these lost values. Rural development must protect, strengthen and, where necessary, restore this intrinsic value. It should therefore cover much more than the promotion of agriculture. A balanced mix of agriculture, trade and industry, natural environment and outdoor leisure activities represents an effective starting point - a \"green alliance\" - which will also strengthen the economy. Nature conservation is one example of an area where such an alliance can come into play. Recently published statistics show that in several rural areas the agricultural sector accounts for some 25% of the rural economy and that approximately 60% of the agricultural workforce receives an additional income from other activities. This situation can be assumed to obtain in many European regions; agriculture does, however, obviously remain one of the most important economic activities in rural areas, notwithstanding the declining number of people working directly in the sector. The overall quality of the countryside is therefore of crucial importance. It is this which can offer genuine opportunities for the development of a highly diversified economy, be it in agriculture, crafts, industrial SMEs, leisure and tourism or the ability to attract inhabitants and be a source of ecological resources. Outline framework plan for regional development in rural areas 6. Background 6.1 An integrated regional development plan should be based on the specific profile of the region concerned and describe, inter alia, the features which contribute to the quality of the area CdR 389/96 fin F/NL/HO/CH/ym .../... ",
        "- 7- In addition, suitable instruments should be identified to facilitate analytical classification of areas with specific characteristics within areas defined as rural. 7. Content of a regional development plan 7.1 As already stated, a regional development plan should primarily be based on an analysis of the strengths of the region concerned. Every rural area has an individual profile deriving from the presence of different types of agricultural land, landscape features and ecologically important areas, region-specific patterns of settlement, the existence or absence of cultural/historical assets and, not least, its distance from urban areas. The existing features make it possible to identify development opportunities, although care must be taken to avoid the pitfalls of traditional stereotyping. Thus the traditional image of the agricultural sector is one of small-scale, diversified and intensive production units generating high added value in the vicinity of major population centres, whilst large-scale producers are more likely to be found in more remote regions. Present-day storage and transport facilities mean that the traditional factors making up this image are not necessarily decisive any more. 7.2 Similarly, the wide availability of good agricultural land need not necessarily be equated with the desirable objective of increasing the size of agricultural holdings. There is considerable evidence to show that the influx of energetic newcomers can have a stimulating effect. The rural exodus is a regular subject of discussion, partly because of its human implications. Nevertheless, rural development requires equal attention to be paid to population influx, which so far has largely failed to materialize. In this connection, reference should be made to a study conducted by the Agricultural University of Wageningen (Netherlands) which collected some remarkable data on what it referred to as \"the hidden power of rural women\". This study concluded: \"Where women really succeed in influencing the development of businesses, these tend to be less specialized or to cover several lines of activity. At the same time, they are the somewhat smaller-scale businesses ...\". Furthermore: \"In this connection, it appears that rural women represent a powerful driving force behind what is currently referred to as rural renewal.\" The merits of rural areas also make them suitable for residential developments. It is generally accepted that older people who move from urban to rural areas contribute significantly to local spending. New types of \"country estates\" have also been a success in a number of areas. These estates involve the building of accommodation and the development of the surrounding land, with the cost of the latter being included in the cost of the accommodation. The crucial point is that agriculture and many other sectors, particularly small enterprises providing goods or services, must be provided with a wide variety of opportunities to develop the different features of rural areas. This will sometimes necessitate investment in the appropriate infrastructure. It will be subsequently worthwhile identifying the distinguishing features of rural areas, the basic opportunities available for making qualitative improvements and the policy measures and instruments which can be used to turn these opportunities to good effect. Sufficient data is available for this purpose from many European rural areas and could be used to draw up development plans. The European Union could be given the task of collecting and circulating this data. CdR389/96 fin F/NL/HO/CH/ym .../... ",
        "- 9- European level is indispensable. This is because it must be possible to implement crucial sectoral policies at national and European level and because the absence of supraregional coordination could lead to counter-productive interregional competition. The national and European contexts also offer adequate scope for regional diversification. 10.2 National and supranational policy is frequently sectorally-orientated. The specific resources available at these higher levels, including subsidies and other funds, must be skillfully combined at regional level to form a coherent policy base. 10.3 Regions must also maintain links with local authorities, interest groups and organizations for the purpose of refining and implementing policy. A sufficiently broad base with adequate local support is indispensable for the feasibility and execution of a development plan. Endogenous development is essential for lasting results. Whilst the administrative authority has a managerial role to play, it cannot play all roles at once. The same is true with regard to funding; private investment is needed to create a healthy economic base for regional development. 10.4 The administrative model for regional development can be compared to an hour glass: i.e. when the regional development plan is put together, a careful selection is made at regional level from the range of national and supranational policies and associated policy instruments available. A variety of activities and measures is then initiated throughout the whole region on the basis of this plan. 10.5 Insofar as there are (still) no integrated rural development funds at European and/or national level, resources must also be centralized at regional level rather like the sand in an hour glass. The centralization of resources at a higher level would be worth considering. 11. The key recommendations are as follows: 11.1 Rural areas should seek to conserve or establish certain values (relating to the landscape, culture and the natural environment) not only for the benefit of their own inhabitants but also in the general interest and thus in the context of national and European policy; these values have not (as yet) been quantified (e.g. value of maintaining the manmade landscape). It is important in this context, inter alia, to create alternative and supplementary sources of income for those working in agriculture in order to ensure that the countryside continues to be utilized. 11.2 Although European rural areas face comparable problems, individual solutions must be found for each region in the light of its inherent characteristics. All rural areas must be covered by the policy. It is necessary to integrate policy and action at regional level, with the regions themselves being able to choose between the options available under European and national policy. In addition to a specific rural development policy, it is equally important for regions to be able to apply the right mix of European and national sectoral policies. Regional level integration also offers greater opportunities for involving all interested parties in an area in development policy. A bottom-up CdR 389/96 fin F/NL/HO/CH/ym .../... ",
