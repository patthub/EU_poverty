",
        "9.3.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 76/195 Thursday 31 May 2018 T. whereas the Paris Agreement sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2 \u00b0C above pre- industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1,5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels; whereas the EU is committed to contributing its fair share towards these goals through emissions reductions in all sectors; U. whereas ecodesign measures should cover the whole lifecycle of products in order to improve resource efficiency in the Union, taking into account the fact that more than 80 % of a product\u2019s environmental impact is determined at the design stage, which therefore plays a highly important role in promoting the circular economy aspects, durability, upgradability, reparability, reuse and recycling of a product; V. whereas in addition to making more sustainable and resource-efficient products, the principles of the sharing economy and the service economy need to be strengthened, while Member States should pay special attention to low-income households, inclu - ding those at risk of energy poverty, when presenting programmes to encourage the uptake of the most resource-efficient pro - ducts and services; W. whereas the Union is a party to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), and is therefore required to take action on phasing out those hazardous substances, including by limiting their use at product design stage; An effective tool to deliver cost-effective energy savings 1. Considers that the Ecodesign Directive has been a successful instrument for the improvement of energy efficiency, has resulted in a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and has led to economic benefits for consumers; 2. Recommends that the Commission continue to include more product groups selected on the basis of their ecodesign potential, including both energy efficiency and material efficiency potential as well as other environmental aspects, using the methodology set out in Article 15 of the directive, and that it keep existing standards up to date, in order to reap the full potential of the directive\u2019s scope and objectives; 3. Underlines that the Ecodesign Directive improves the functioning of the EU internal market through the definition of common product standards; stresses that the continued adoption of harmonised product requirements at EU level supports innovation, research and the competitiveness of EU manufacturers and ensures fair competition, while avoiding an unnecessary administrative burden; 4. Recalls that the directive requires the Commission to come forward with implementing measures where a product meets the criteria, i.e. significant volumes of products sold, significant environmental impact and potential for improvement; stresses the res - ponsibility placed on the Commission to respect this mandate and ensure that the benefits to consumers, the circular economy and the environment are effectively achieved, recognising that such product standards can only be applied at EU level and that Member States therefore rely on the Commission to take the necessary action; 5. Believes that coordination with initiatives connected to the circular economy would further enhance the effectiveness of the directive; calls, therefore, for an ambitious plan on ecodesign and the circular economy, providing both environmental benefits and opportunities for sustainable growth and jobs, including in the SME sector, as well as advantages for consumers; notes that higher resource efficiency and the use of secondary raw materials in manufacturing offers considerable potential for cutting waste and econo - mising on resources; 6. Underlines that the Ecodesign Directive is part of a larger toolbox and that its effectiveness is dependent on synergies with other instruments, in particular on energy labelling; considers that overlapping regulations should be avoided; Strengthening the decision-making process 7. Highlights the key role of the Consultation Forum in bringing together industry, civil society and other stakeholders in the deci - sion-making process and considers that this entity is working well; ",
        "C 76/196 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.3.2020 Thursday 31 May 2018 8. Is concerned by the sometimes significant delays in the development and adoption of implementing measures, which create uncertainty for economic operators, have led to significant missed opportunities for energy savings for consumers and the associated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and can cause adopted measures to lag behind technological developments; 9. Notes that the implementation delays are due in part to the limited resources available within the Commission; calls on the Commission to deploy sufficient resources for the ecodesign process given the significant EU added value of the legislation; 10. Urges the Commission to avoid delays in the adoption and publication of implementing measures and recommends defining clear deadlines and milestones for their finalisation and for the revision of existing regulations; considers that ecodesign measures should be adopted individually and released as soon as they are completed; 11. Stresses the need to stick to the schedule provided for in the 2016-2019 Ecodesign Working Plan; 12. Emphasises the need to base the ecodesign requirements on solid technical analysis and impact assessments, taking as a refe - rence the best-performing products or technologies on the market and the technological development in each sector; calls on the Commission to give priority to the implementation and review of measures relating to products that have the greatest potential in terms of both primary energy savings and the circular economy; 13. Recognises that the Ecodesign Directive allows for the use of voluntary agreements; underlines that voluntary agreements can be used instead of implementing measures where they cover a large majority of the market and are deemed capable of guaranteeing at least an equal level of environmental performance, and that they should guarantee a faster decision-making process; considers that the efficacy of the surveillance of voluntary agreements should be strengthened and the adequate involvement of civil society ensured; welcomes, in this respect, Commission Recommendation (EU) 2016/2125 on guidelines for self-regulation measures concluded by industry and asks the Commission to strictly monitor all voluntary agreements recognised under the Ecodesign Directive; 14. Encourages the integration of technology learning curves into the Methodology for the Ecodesign of Energy-Related Products (MEERP) so as to anticipate technology improvements by the time the regulations enter into force and ensure the regulations remain up to date; 15. Calls on the Commission to include assessments on release of microplastics into the aquatic environment in the ecodesign measures where appropriate; calls on the Commission to introduce mandatory requirements for microplastic filters in the review of the ecodesign measures for household washing machines and washer dryers; From energy savings to resource efficiency 16. Reiterates its call for a new impetus on the circular economy aspects of products and considers that the Ecodesign Directive provides significant potential for improving resource efficiency that is still untapped; 17. Believes, therefore, that the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive \u2013 in addition to continued efforts to improve energy efficiency \u2013 must now systematically address the full lifecycle of each product group within its scope by the setting up of minimum resource efficiency criteria covering, inter alia, durability, robustness, reparability and upgradability, but also sharing potential, reuse, scalability, recyclability, possibility of remanufacturing, content of recycled or secondary raw materials, and the use of critical raw materials; 18. Considers that the choice of circular economy criteria for each product group must be well specified and defined in a clear and objective manner, while being easily measurable and achievable at a proportionate cost, in order to ensure that the directive remains implementable; ",
        "9.3.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 76/197 Thursday 31 May 2018 19. Calls for systematic in-depth analyses of the circular economy potential during preparatory studies for specific ecodesign mea - sures relating to each product category; 20. Emphasises that it is important that manufacturers should provide clear and objective instructions enabling users and inde - pendent repairers to repair products more easily, without specific equipment; also stresses the importance of providing information on the availability of spare parts and product lifetimes, where possible; 21. Highlights the potential benefits of focusing on other environmental aspects beyond energy use, such as dangerous chemicals, release of microplastics, waste generation and material input, and calls for the tools under the directive to be used to enhance transpa - rency for consumers; 22. Considers that as more than 80 % of the environmental impact of a product is determined at the design stage, it is at that stage that, to a large extent, substances of concern can be avoided, substituted or limited; stresses that the use of materials and substances of critical importance, such as Rare Earth Elements (REE), or substances of a toxic nature or substances of concern, such as POPs and endocrine disrupters, must be specifically considered under the broadened ecodesign criteria in order to restrict their use or substitute them, where appropriate, or at least ensure the possibility of extracting/separating them at end-of-life, without prejudice to other har - monised legal requirements concerning those substances laid down at Union level; 23. Calls for ecodesign requirements, in the case of energy-related products, not to create targets which are hard for EU producers to meet, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, whose capacity in relation to patented technologies is significantly smal - ler than that of market-leading companies; 24. Welcomes in this regard the 2016-2019 Ecodesign work programme, which includes commitments to develop requirements and standards for material efficiency, supporting the use of secondary raw materials, and urges the Commission to complete this work as a matter of priority; considers that such criteria should be product-specific, based on robust analyses, focus on areas with clear improvement potential and be enforceable and verifiable by market surveillance authorities; considers that, when defining best prac - tices, the use of results of past and ongoing research activities and cutting-edge innovations in waste electrical and electronic equip - ment recycling should be promoted; 25. Believes that the development of a \u2018system approach\u2019 to consider not only the product but the whole system required for its functioning in the Ecodesign process is becoming an increasingly critical success factor for resource efficiency and urges the Commis - sion to include more of such system-level opportunities in the next Ecodesign work programme; 26. Believes that particular attention must be paid to water-using products where significant environmental benefits and impor - tant savings for consumers could be achieved; 27. Calls on the Commission to encourage the recovery of critical raw materials also from mining waste; 28. Notes that the Commission has postponed action on information and communication technologies (ICT) such as mobiles and smartphones, pending further assessments and given the rapid technological changes in this product group; considers, however, that these products, which are sold in large numbers and replaced frequently, have a clear potential for improvements, in particular in terms of resource efficiency, and that ecodesign criteria should therefore be applied to them and that efforts should be made to streamline the regulatory progress; stresses the need to carefully assess how to improve the ecodesign of product groups for which reparability and replacement of spare parts are key ecodesign parameters; 29. Stresses the need for reparability to be facilitated by the availability of spare parts throughout the lifecycle of a product at a rea - sonable price in relation to the total cost of the product; ",
        "C 76/198 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.3.2020 Thursday 31 May 2018 30. Recalls its demands for a broad review of the Union\u2019s product policy framework in order to address resource efficiency features; in this context, asks the Commission to assess whether the current ecodesign methodology could be used for other product categories in addition to energy-related products and to come forward with proposals for new legislation as appropriate; 31. Stresses that, in order to ensure the use of recycled/secondary materials, the availability of high-quality secondary materials is imperative, and a well-organised market for secondary materials should therefore be established; 32. Stresses the importance of attributing responsibility to producers and expanding guarantee periods and conditions, of obliging manufacturers to take responsibility for the management of the waste stage of a product\u2019s lifecycle in line with the relevant Union legis - lation, of boosting reparability, upgradability, modularity and recyclability and of ensuring that raw materials and waste management remain within the European Union; 33. Calls for the extension of minimum guarantees for consumer durable goods; Improving market surveillance 34. Insists on the need to strengthen the surveillance of products placed on the internal market through better cooperation and coordination between Member States and between the Commission and national authorities and through the provision of adequate financial resources to the market surveillance authorities; 35. Calls on the Commission to examine the potential of establishing a digital product fact sheet (\u2018product passport\u2019), as suggested in the Council conclusions of 18 December 2017 on eco-innovation, as a tool to disclose materials and substances used in products, which would also facilitate market surveillance; 36. Calls for a more coherent and cost-effective market surveillance system across the Union to ensure compliance with the Ecode - sign Directive, and makes the following recommendations: \u2014 that national authorities be required to use the ICSMS database to share all the results of product compliance checks and testing carried out for all products covered by Ecodesign regulations; this database should include all relevant information for compliant and non-compliant products in order to avoid unnecessary testing in another Member State and should be user-friendly and easily accessible; \u2014 that the general product registration database for energy labelled products be extended to all products covered by Ecodesign regula - tions; \u2014 that national authorities be required to draw up specific plans for their market surveillance activities in the area of ecodesign, to be notified to other Member States and to the Commission as provided for under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 ( 9 ); Member States should include random inspections in these plans; \u2014 that fast screening methods be applied to detect products that do not comply with the regulations, and that these be elaborated in cooperation with industry experts and shared with public bodies; \u2014 that the Commission consider defining a minimum percentage of products on the market to be tested, as well as develop a mandate for carrying out its own independent market surveillance and make proposals, as appropriate; \u2014 that deterrent measures be adopted, including: sanctions for non-compliant manufacturers proportional to the impact of non- compliance on the entire European market and compensation for consumers who have purchased non-compliant products, even beyond the legal warranty period, including through collective redress; \u2014 that particular attention be paid to non-EU imports and products sold online; \u2014 that coherence be ensured with the Commission\u2019s proposal for a regulation laying down rules and procedures for compliance with and enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products (COM(2017)0795), the scope of which includes products regu - lated under the Ecodesign Directive; in this context, supports the facilitation at EU level of joint testing; ( 9 ) Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30). ",
        "9.3.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 76/199 Thursday 31 May 2018 37. Highlights the importance of appropriate and clearly defined harmonised testing standards and stresses that test protocols as close as possible to real-life conditions should be developed; underlines that test methods should be robust and designed and executed in a way that rules out manipulation and intentional or unintentional amelioration of the results; considers that the tests should not give rise to an unreasonable burden for businesses, in particular taking into account SMEs, which do not have the same capacity as their bigger competitors; welcomes Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/2282 on the use of tolerances in verification procedures; 38. Calls for the Commission to support Member States in their enforcement work and for enhanced cooperation when a product is found to be non-compliant; stresses the need for guidance for manufacturers and importers on the detailed requirements of the documents needed for the market surveillance authorities; Other recommendations 39. Stresses the need to ensure consistency and convergence between ecodesign regulations and horizontal regulations such as Union legislation on chemicals and waste, including REACH and the WEEE and RoHS Directives, and highlights the need to strengthen synergies with Green Public Procurement and the EU Ecolabel; 40. Underlines the link between the Ecodesign Directive and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive; calls on Member States to incentivise the market uptake of efficient products and services and to step up their inspection and advice activities; believes that improving the ecodesign of energy-related products can in turn have a positive impact on the energy performance of buildings; 41. Underlines the need to provide the general public, and in particular the media, with clear information about the benefits of eco - design ahead of the release of a measure, and encourages the Commission and the Member States to communicate proactively on the benefits of ecodesign measures as an integral part of the process of adopting these measures, and to engage more actively with stakeholders to improve people\u2019s understanding of the legislation; 42. Stresses that the transition to a sustainable and circular economy will present not only many opportunities but also social challenges; considers, as nobody should be left behind, that the Commission and the Member States should pay special attention to low-income households at risk of energy poverty when presenting programmes to encourage the uptake of the most resource-efficient products; believes that such programmes should not hinder innovation but should continue to allow manufacturers to offer consu - mers a broad range of high-quality products, and that they should also favour the market penetration of energy-related and water- using products capable of achieving greater resource efficiency and savings for consumers; 43. Calls on the EU institutions and the Member States to set the right example by establishing and making full use of the circular economy and the Green Public Procurement strategies (GPP) in order to prioritise proven sustainable products, such as Ecolabel pro - ducts, and the highest resource efficiency standards in all investments, and to promote a widespread use of green procurement, inclu - ding in the private sector; o o o 44. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States. "
