        "Clean water is vital and needs to be protected. Water quality is constantly under threat from chemical pollutants discharged into water from various sources such as industry, households or pesticides. We all rely on the use of, for instance, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. However, the risk that some of these substances may pose after their use, needs to be understood and managed. Questions like \u201cDoes a pharmaceutical potentially harm sea birds when appearing in oceans?\u201d, \u201cIs caffeine a risk for fish?\u201d or simply \u201cCan I drink this water?\u201d require sound scientific answers. Understanding what chemicals can do to our water quality is important for managing one of our most precious natural resources. For policy measures to be truly effective in maintaining water quality, they need to be accurate and targeted to specific pollutant activities. This is where the IES\u2019 contribution is critical as it performs research on the many chemical, biological and ecological processes regarding chemical pollutants in water. Having a proper scientific understanding of the fate of chemical pollutants in water helps develop legislation that will benefit European water quality. ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu WATER QUALITY ",
        "DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES, in 2008 and 2009, screened 164 groundwater bodies across Europe for newly developed chemical substances, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals? DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES contributed technical advice and best practices for sampling and analysing water containing chemical pollutants; successfully supporting the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive? DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES organised a campaign with 27 analytical laboratories from 11 Member States, in order to compare the different sampling and analysis methods being used for assessing water quality? The overarching goal of EU legislation is to provide a harmonised approach achieving good water quality for all EU citizens. The IES supports this by encouraging all Member States to use comparably good measurement methods and techniques. In this way, the end results of the monitoring exercises across all Member States can be compared and this can truly make a difference to the effective implementation of European legislation related to water quality. In order to collect relevant information the IES uses various types of measurement techniques and tools. The main objectives are to measure and monitor the quantity of chemical pollutants in water, the frequency with which they occur, their bio-chemical characteristics, or their effects on water quality. Monitoring and measuring chemical pollutants Various substances can damage water quality or disturb the ecological health of a water body. Among them are excessive amounts of nutrients and fertilizers, even if useful and essential in lower quantities. Nutrients are used for example, in agriculture, and can reach surface and groundwaters. The IES performs research on the pathways such nutrients take, in order to evaluate them on their journey to different water bodies. The IES also evaluates the effects of current legislation on water quality and nutrient losses into water. It develops scenarios aiming at improving the situation and supports the development of future legislative measures.

        "ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu FOSTERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Agricultural production in Africa has increased by more than 50% over the past 25 years, but malnutrition levels are still high. With a rapidly increasing population, Africa is in dire need of sustainable production and growth solutions. The African Union-European Union strategy, adopted in 2007, defines long-term policy orientations between Africa and Europe. As part of this strategy, the IES is very active in the Africa-EU Partnership on Science, Information Society and Space, which aims to bridge the scientific and digital divide in Africa by using remote sensing to help Africa to monitor its environment in the pursuit of sustainable development. The IES also provides information on droughts, floods, forest changes and soils in Africa, bringing the latest in European scientific knowledge and developments to Africa, so that African decision makers can choose the best options for sustainably managing natural resources.

        "THE AIR WE BREATHE What we call air is a complex mixture of gases together with liquids and fine solids in suspension. Trace gases and particulate matter in the air can have both, natural and man-made origins. Whether individual components have harmful pollutant effects is largely a question of their concentration. Because of this complexity, the IES carries out detailed atmospheric measurements, critical assessments of existing data, and modelling studies at local, regional, continental and global scales. The better our understanding is, of atmospheric composition, its interactions and its effects, the better we can inform air pollution and climate change policy-making. ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu ",
        "Reducing GHGs emissions will slow down global warming. Often the technical measures taken, e.g. reducing fuel consumption, also reduce emissions of particulate matter and their precursor gases. The resulting reductions in particulate matter concentrations in the atmosphere are beneficial for human health, however, this same \u201ccleaning up\u201d allows more solar radiation to reach the earth, in turn adding to global warming. But not all air pollutants behave in this antagonistic way. The IES is trying to identify win-win situations where air quality is improved, and climate change will be slowed down, avoiding too fast short-term and too strong long-term warming of the planet\u2019s biosphere. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs) DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES has calculated four emission scenarios for the coming decades, that show the potential effects of a wide range of feasible Air Pollution and Climate Change policy measures? The IES has calculated the effects of each of these four scenarios on global climate. DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES uses a mobile laboratory to audit air pollution in the EU Member States, comparing the quality of fine particle measurements? DID YOU KNOW that current atmospheric methane concentrations are about 2.5 times higher than preindustrial levels? Man-made methane emissions come mainly from agriculture (ruminants, rice cultivation), landfills, but also coal mining, and oil and gas production. The most important natural source of methane are wetlands. Atmospheric methane (CH 4 ) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after CO2. However, large uncertainties exist about methane emissions estimated from statistical data (so-called \u201cbottom-up\u201d estimates), mainly because of uncertainties in the emission factors. For instance, methane emissions from wetlands show large variability in space and time. An alternative way to set meaningful limits to our estimates of methane emissions is to use atmospheric concentration measurements in an inverse model: It calculates how much methane needs to be emitted from where and when, in order to reproduce the observations.

Gardi (from left to right) DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES calculated the combined effects of climate change policies and air pollution policies? It was concluded that while it will be difficult to avoid some rapid but limited increase of temperature in the coming 20-30 years, the biosphere should benefit from climate stabilisation in the long term. ccu.jrc.ec.europa.eu For more information: E-mail: ies-contact@jrc.ec.europa.eu IES Internet website: ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES has developed a sophisticated inverse modelling system for atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide (N2O), based on a global, 3-dimensional atmospheric transport model?

        "DESERTIFICATION LAND DEGRADATION DROUGHT The IES provides information on various aspects of desertification, land degradation and drought for European, African and global stakeholders. Policy makers and national authorities are thereby enabled to prepare for, adapt to, or limit the damage of these phenomena that are expected to become more pronounced as a result of climate change. To be able to offer timely, appropriate and scientifically sound information, the IES has developed innovative tools to monitor, evaluate and characterise drought phenomena, providing a broad and accurate view of the situation. ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu ",
        "DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES is developing methods and tools for assessing, monitoring and forecasting drought in Africa? Climate variability and change are likely to affect land and land-use indirectly. Changing precipitation patterns, either with more extreme events or decreasing frequency, can lead to amplified irregular situations; droughts can become more recurrent and severe, potentially expanding the dryland areas of the world. These shifting conditions not only affect the land and its normal functions in providing ecosystem services such as healthy soil, water and biodiversity, but also jeopardise food production and agricultural development. Such land degradation is possibly aggravating poverty in vulnerable areas. Helping to foresee and combat these phenomena, the IES is developing innovative tools and information systems to improve monitoring and assessment of droughts and desertification. The results of these efforts will enable policy-makers to develop focused and effective strategies. They will help counteract, limit and adapt to the damage which these phenomena can cause to the environment and to societies which rely on it. Causes and Consequences DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES has started to compile the new \u201cWorld Atlas of Desertification\u201d with an international network of experts? The European Drought Observatory (EDO), a project the IES is currently developing, offers a European view on droughts and is mainly intended for use by national authorities. For these stakeholders, such a support tool is critical to enlarge the perspective beyond their geographical borders. The EDO processes meteorological and satellite- based data into monitoring information on European droughts which is made available through a powerful web map server. The IES is also contributing to a World Atlas of Desertication launched in partnership with UNEP (The United Nations Enviromental Programme). The Atlas will contain information on desertification and land degradation from global to local scales, bringing state-of-the-art scientific findings into the policy arena. It will offer a wealth of information for decision makers through a web-based digital atlas portal.

        "The soil is home to a vast array of organisms which provide many important ecosystem services. Agricultural land benefits greatly from soil biodiversity, while farmed land can also provide habitats for many species. Europe\u2019s agricultural history has led to the development of specific ecosystems, which today account for a substantial part of Europe\u2019s biodiversity. However, current trends in agriculture such as land abandonment and agricultural intensification pose a significant threat to this ecological heritage. Sustainable management of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland areas is key to the achievement of biodiversity targets. The IES provides scientific advice on the links between the environment and agriculture. Current areas of research include water pollution, irrigation, soil, pesticide use, biofuels and landscape management. The IES developed and hosts the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC), the focal point for European soil information relevant to EU policies.

The overall impact we make is described as our environmental footprint. Environmental footprints can be quantified in a comprehensive way using life cycle assessment (LCA). An LCA evaluates a product\u2019s impact on the environment over its entire life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials, its manufacture and use, through to recycling or its ultimate disposal. The insights gained through LCA can help producers, consumers and policy makers to make informed choices that help sustain rather than harm the environment.

        "FLOODS AND FOREST FIRES: EARLY PREPARATION IS KEY Floods and forest fires have become more frequent in the past years. Being natural hazards, they cannot be instantly stopped. However, the damage they cause can be limited. The European Commission, through its research arm, the Joint Research Centre, is developing early warning systems in close collaboration with Member State authorities in order to be able to prevent or limit these natural hazards. These science-based efforts enable the European Commission to send out alerts and constantly updated maps to national authorities so they can warn civilians and prepare their civil protection forces. In this way, lives are saved, the environment is protected and properties are spared from damage. ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu ",
        "DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES sent out 43 flood alerts over a two-year period through the European Flood Alert System (EFAS) to National Flood Authorities? In more than 60% of the alerted cases floods actually occured. During the spring of 2010, floods in Hungary, Romania, Ireland and Italy once again confirmed that efficient flood risk management and adapting to extreme weather are critical. Apart from the threat floods pose to a single country, their impact often evolves across borders. One of the initiatives to improve the preparedness for floods is the European Flood Alert System (EFAS), which is being developed and tested at the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre. National authorities mostly monitor developments within their own borders and have often been taken by surprise by high levels of water flowing in from neighbouring countries\u2019 rivers. EFAS takes account of hydro-geographical data, weather conditions and rainfall forecasts over the whole of Europe and helps to improve preparedness for upcoming floods by providing warnings up to 10 days in advance. Reservoirs can then be opened, rescue services alerted earlier and if necessary, people can be evacuated in a timely manner. European Flood Alert System (EFAS) DID YOU KNOW THAT EFAS achieves with a 7-day forecast today the same prediction quality as with a 5-day forecast 10 years ago? Every year, forest fires in Europe cause unacceptable losses in terms of human lives and damage to property and to the environment. Fire danger forecasts, monitoring of fire activity, assessment of damages due to fires and post fire recovery are essential tools to support the authorities in charge of forest fire prevention and fighting. The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) provides European, national institutions and citizens with near real time harmonised information on forest fires and their effects in Europe. Moreover, EFFIS produces an improved prediction of critical fire danger situations and facilitates international collaboration in forest firefighting in critical fire events. Through its website EFFIS delivers fire danger predictions up to six days in advance, as well as daily updated information on active fires and fire damages in Europe. Additional modules in EFFIS analyse post-fire effects (such as soil erosion and gas emissions) and make use of satellite imagery to monitor the recovery of vegetation in the burnt areas.

        "Forests: getting the bigger picture Forests serve many important functions \u2013 they filter air and water, absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere, provide habitats for multitudes of different organisms, conserve soil, and modulate hydrological flow. We need to protect and conserve the world\u2019s forests in order to maintain a healthy biosphere. Deforestation and forest fragmentation can lead to biodiversity loss and, in extreme cases, the proliferation of desert areas. Deforestation in the tropics is also recognised to be a major contributor to CO 2 emissions.

Several initiatives have attempted to provide forest maps at different scales, but the disparity in the level of detail and the underlying definition of forests make them unusable for international reporting processes. The IES develops new methods for consistent and comparable forest monitoring across Europe. It produces up-to-date European forest maps. It also investigates the characterisation, mapping and reporting on European forest spatial patterns, forest fragmentation and forest connectivity. It measures if, how and where local forest spatial patterns change over time and how forest fragmentation processes and changes in forest connectivity occur. Mapping European forests DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES provides European-wide maps and analyses of forest patterns and derived products on forest fragmentation and connectivity through the European Forest Data Centre? Deforestation is thought to contribute to circa 15% of global warming and the greenhouse effect.

Morover, indicators are given, which can be used to measure the quality of the marine environment. Environmental Marine Information System (EMIS) DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES\u2019 \u201cEMIS\u201d has been monitoring the vulnerability of European coastal waters to man-induced eutrophication for more than a decade? The EU has developed the \u201cMarine Strategy Framework Directive\u201d to guide the efforts of all Member States towards the uniform goal of protection, management and preservation of the marine environment. IES research in this field is aimed at helping the Commission and Member States to assess the marine environmental status in Europe in an integrated manner and to act accordingly. For instance, the IES analyses how human activities on land influence the quality of the marine environment and its biodiversity and what kind of activities pollute the seas and coasts and what kind of areas are affected by it. The IES derives its knowledge from satellite-born data, uses simulation models and thus understands various characteristics and patterns of our marine environmental heritage. This enables the scientists to develop key marine indicators and to use them in monitoring. An integrated view of European Seas and Coasts DID YOU KNOW THAT THE IES discovered that the surface temperature of the Mediterranean sea increased on average by 0.04 \u00b0C per year for the last 22 years?
