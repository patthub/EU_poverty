        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 Editorial Occhiello 3 A deeply-rooted ancestral fear \u2013 that of suf- fering through famine \u2013 was awakened by worldwide skirmishes which were quickly dubbed \u201chunger riots\u201d. Even better-off countries that seemed to have protected themselves against this sort of scourge were affected. As news seeped through, increasingly tense words were used to put across the increasing manifestations of fear: demonstrations in Egypt, riots in Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Sri Lanka and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and vio- lent clashes in Haiti. Watching these events unfold, some may recall that the rich economic blocs were originally created to protect against famine. In the past, the European Union allocated up to two-thirds of its budget to its agricultural policy. This was the price for peace of mind over the fear of hunger that cruelly played on the minds of those who had known such suffering and which was stamped on their collective memory. Others recall that while in the past no country had ever become rich through scrupulous respect for nature, good governance or human rights, the demands placed on poor countries today to meet such expectations are unparalleled. Today still the major economic powers are the ones that have managed to feed themselves rather than those with exportable raw materials, whether oil or diamonds. This is not simply a matter of good gover- nance. Both China and India are entering the circles of the powerful, but only after firstly becoming more successful at feeding their own populations. And India had already been providing engineers and mathemati- cians to the world for some time. Until recently that which had been little cause for con- cern was quickly shown in its true dimensions: as a global disaster. European Development Commissioner, Louis Michel, who in the past had already expressed his concern, now described this as a \u201ctsunami.\u201d Moreover, the World Food Programme (WFP) already sounded the alarm back in March, a month before the outbreaks. But how many of the forecasters, economists and ana- lysts saw anything coming, despite the fact that there\u2019s nothing really new to all this in the countries affected? In Haiti, for example, under the first presidency of Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val in the late 1990s, rice fields vanished. Haiti is a country that was at one time a net exporter of rice. The blame for this was put on irrigation prob- lems, but was above all it was due to the actions of US agro-food giants that sold their rice below the local production price until Haitian farmers were finally forced out of business. Of course, explanations existed: bad governance, lack of freedom, low quality education and health. While such reasons are all valid, they do not alone suffice. Then there were the advice given to many emerging economies when it seemed that economic develop- ment was being held back by rising energy prices. The solution? More biodiesel had to be produced \u2013 but it seems that the soya, palm oil or maize used to manu- facture the product came at the expense of crops grown for food. Of course, biodiesel initially won over as it commanded a higher price. This is an economic game that can prove extremely dangerous and lead to spiralling food prices. The road to hell really is paved with good intentions. This issue of The Courier looks at the dilemma. We also report on Sierra Leone, a country at the very bottom of the UNDP development rankings. It is today a place of hope: the expansion of electricity in the country coinciding with a new government in office. Although the nation\u2019s agriculture minister is being wooed to produce biofuel from palm oil, he would rather think this through before making a final deci- sion. It would appear he is not ready to let the \u2018golden calf\u2019 of energy take the place of staple foodstuffs like rice and cocoa. There is light in such uncertainty.

        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 To the point Occhiello 5 4 T o the point were to resort to the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), to negotiate a new market access arrangement for goods only, or to nego- tiate a complete EPA. The region, recognising the market potential in services and investment, decided that a full EPA was its best option. The negotiations were com- pleted on 16 December 2007 not because of external pressure, but rather because the nego- tiators and the heads were confident that the Agreement was a good one and that the man- date had been achieved. Is the EPA challenge-proof in the WTO? In law, successful litigation is generally depend- ent upon two variables: the interpretation of the law and the credibility of arguments presented by the challenger and by the defence. The WTO is no exception. Therefore, it is possible that challenges to the EPA from WTO membership could arise. Some elements of the rules of the WTO are ambiguous and have not been conclu- sively tested and interpreted within WTO jurisprudence. This ambiguity facilitates avenues for challenge, especially from compet- ing developed countries and non-ACP develop- ing countries. At the same time, legal ambigui- ty provides latitude for liberal interpretations and the application of the legal principle. The whole purpose of entering into negotiations was an arrangement which, in contrast to the Cotonou preferences that required a waiver, would be compatible with the rules of the WTO. We have been careful to negotiate an Agreement that would secure our trading inter- ests but that could survive legal scrutiny. What are the benefits of the EPA for Caribbean people? One of the most immediate benefits of the EPA is that it allows CARIFORUM to avoid facing the GSP, which would have been significantly less advantageous than the EPA. Certainly key CARIFORUM industries, such as the banana industry, would have suffered if no EPA was in place because there is no coverage for bananas under the GSP. Additionally, in the short to medium term, tariff reductions could lead to the depreciation of some prices of goods and services, which may result in savings to the consumer. Falling retail prices would also lower the production costs of CARIFORUM producers whose production processes and inputs are highly dependent upon imports. In the long term, the EPA secures CARIFO- RUM preferential market access to Europe, across both traditional and new sectors in goods and services in a form that is consistent with WTO rules. What about the tariff revenue losses for ACP governments? The commitment to liberalise means that both CARIFORUM and Europe will have to remove import duties from certain goods. This will lead to a loss of revenue originating from these tar- iffs. CARIFORUM is expected to liberalise as much as 80 per cent of all goods imported from Europe. However, the commitment to remove tariffs is not immediate for CARIFORUM. Whereas Europe is expected to immediately remove duties and quota restrictions for all goods except rice and sugar, CARIFORUM is allowed several phasing schedules before it is necessary for products to become completely duty free. For some products, CARIFORUM is allowed to delay liberalisation by 5, 10 or 15 years, and in some other cases up to 25 years. Furthermore, the EPA provides a list of products which will be exempted from liberalisation. Under a trade agreement like the EPA, it is expected that any revenue losses will be com- pensated by capitalisation of the market access opportunities available to firms. However, CARIFORUM adjustment to revenue loss caused by liberalisation can be realised further by reforming tax systems with the aim of tran- sitioning away from taxes that impede trade flows to other forms of taxation. What sort of development aid is needed to underpin the EPA? Successful implementation of the Agreement within CARIFORUM hinges upon the expres- sion and implementation of financial and non- financial development support and cooperation. The EPA\u2019s development support measures and priorities are broadly outlined in a chapter on development but are more specifically detailed in individual chapters related to the particular trade subjects under the Agreement. Defining the formulation and implementation of specific development support projects must be preceded by a process of needs assessment. This process of needs assessment, though not complete, started even before the conclusion of the EPA negotiations. The evaluation of the costs of implementation will be determined through this process. It is up to the Member States to deter- mine what these projects will be. And the monitoring? Monitoring of the implementation of the EPAis to be facilitated through participatory processes at the national levels of CARIFORUM and Europe. However, the EPAalso includes certain institutional provisions. Such provisions include the establishment of the Joint CARIFO- RUM-EU Council, the CARIFORUM-EU Trade and Development Committee and the CARIFORUM-EU Parliamentary Committee.

The EU initialled an EPAon 16 December 2007 with all CARIFORUM States apart from Cuba. T o what extent is the EPA\u2019s successful conclusion due to the CRNM? The CRNM has had a coordinating role in facilitating the development of regional negotiating positions. Such coordination has included facilitating consultations with stake- holders, research and technical work. The suc- cessful conclusion of the EPA is owed therefore in part to the technical labour undertaken by the negotiators and the CRNM, but more impor- tantly to the Member States, which were ulti- mately responsible for determining the negoti- ating mandate and guiding the negotiators throughout the process. \u2018Machinery\u2019implies an onward march, no mat- ter what. When one gets into one\u2019s car, there is a reason- able expectation that the car will start once the key is engaged. Similarly, the expectation of the negotiating \u2018machinery\u2019 is that it too will func- tion properly and consistently as the nature and scope of CARIFORUM foreign trade policy evolves. Did you feel rushed into signing up for an EPA? The implications of the elimination of the non-reciprocal trade preferences under the Cotonou Agreement were very real for our region.

        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 Round up Occhiello 7 R ound up T he Solomon Islands\u2019 parliament passed on 13 December a motion of no confidence in the government, prompting the res- ignation of its leader, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. A week later, his newly installed successor, Derek Sikua, was warmly welcomed by the international community and, above all, by Australia who agreed to step up cooperation, thus putting an end to the tension that has soured relations between the two countries. Most importantly, one of the new government leader\u2019s first actions was to travel to Malaita to offer his apologies to the local population for \u201cthe offences and injus- tices\u201d perpetrated against them during the recent ethnic conflicts. Disputes between natives of this province and the inhabitants of the island of Guadalcanal were mainly respon- sible for plunging the country into a protracted crisis that began in the early 1990s. Derek Sikua\u2019s call for a major reconciliation effort was accompanied by a request for negotiations with the Malaita Province executive in order to get major development projects back on track, including the Aulauta palm oil project, long-awaited on the island. > The notion of \u2018wantok\u2019 When The Courier visited the Solomon Islands a few months ago, for- mer Prime Minister Sogavare (still in office at the time) strongly empha- sised the bitterness of his government\u2019s relations with Australia \u2013 insin- uating that the country was seeking to impose solutions which took no account of the culture and customs of the Solomon Islands. It is important to understand how the situation in the Solomons has come about: the notion of wantok (literally \u2018one talk\u2019). Wantok refers to those who speak the same language and thus of the same clan. This means a duty of solidarity to fel- low clan members often up to the boundaries of what\u2019s lawful. This notion is deeply root- ed in the Melanesian culture of most of the inhabitants of the Solomon Islands. What\u2019s more, the dozen or so islands that make up SS LL OO WW LL YY EE MM EE RR GG II NN GG FF RR OO MM AA PP RR OO TT RR AA CC TT EE DD CC RR II SS II SS Hegel Goutier On 13 December, the Solomon Islands\u2019 parliament elected a new prime minister, fol- lowing a motion of no confidence in his predecessor. This time, the democratic rules were respected without any skirmishes, unlike unfortunate events in the country\u2019s recent past. Tensions with the nation\u2019s powerful neighbour, Australia, quickly eased. There now finally appears to be progress in the long process of exiting the crisis. this country \u2013 which only came together as one nation with independence \u2013 are inhabited by many different clans, many of whom are historically antagonistic towards one another. About 70 languages are spoken by the country\u2019s estimated 540,000 population, with each language totally dif- ferent from another. The process of unification only really started during the Second World War, when the region (and Guadalcanal in particular) was the epicentre of one of the most dramatic and decisive clashes between Japanese and US forces. Here the Japanese finally lost the war and it was the huts at the Honiara military airport that formed the basis of the future capital, Honiara. Together with the other islands grouped around Guadalcanal, the state of the Solomon Islands was formed, despite having no real shared history, and was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1978. The wantok practiced by politicians in positions of power has often been viewed by donor countries as a symbol of bad governance, which helps to explain some misunderstandings, if not serious tensions. > Repeated troubles Tensions between the Malaitans and the population of Guadalcanal quickly marked the short history of the new state. To put this into con- text, the population density on Malaita is relatively high but economic opportunities are relatively low compared to neighbouring Guadalcanal, which is the seat of political power and where a large part of the Malaita population emigrated. The first major troubles date back to the late 1990s and originate in con- flicts between the inhabitants of Malaita who had settled in the province of Guadalcanal and the local indigenous population. The Gwale people of Guadalcanal, the most prosperous of the Solomon Islands, started to protest strongly at what they considered to be an invasion by people from other islands (especially Malaita), accusing them not only of stealing their land but also their jobs. Paramilitary groups were formed. The first of these was the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army (GRA) which intimi- dated the Malaitan \u2018immigrants\u2019, forcing them to flee the rural areas in their thousands, to either the capital or their place of origin. In response to the intimidation by this group of extreme nationalists the Malaitan Eagle Force created in June 2000, staged what amounted to a coup d\u2019e- tat when they seized the prime minister. This in turn gave rise to a new Gwale paramilitary group, the Isatabu Freedom Fighters (replacing the GRA), who assassinated a member of the new government. The resulting violence in the country cost hundreds of lives. Two successive peace agreements between the warring parties pro- duced no lasting solutions and in April 2000 further conflict erupted in the Western Province. The background to this latest crisis was the unsustainable exploitation of the forests by foreign (principally Asian) companies who \u2013 in addition to their impact on the environment, the economy and good governance \u2013 also affected the country\u2019s culture and customs. On several of the region\u2019s islands (including Guadalcanal) land ownership is traditionally handed down among the women of the family. The logging companies were however accused of conducting irregular transactions with some of the village officials and dispossessing women. This sparked a series of mass demonstra- tions by the female population, who were also reportedly the victims of violence at the hands of private security guards employed on some of the plantations.

But often, when they allow foreigners to come, women don\u2019t participate in the decision, so the men receive huge amounts of money. They travel, spend the money and then go back to the village.\u201d In April 2003, the Pacific Island States decided, within the framework of the Biketawa Declarationi, to send a policing mission to the Solomon Islands \u2013 RAMSI (Regional Assistance to the Solomon Islands) \u2013 under the command of Australia who supplied 80 per cent of the manpower, with units from New Zealand and other Pacific islands also contributing and Australia funding the units from Fiji and Papua New Guinea. RAMSI managed to restore order, despite sporadic troubles. However, after elections that passed off relatively peacefully in 2006, the prime minister \u2013 elected with a large majority based on the country\u2019s three prin- cipal parties \u2013 was forced to resign following several days of rioting. Accusations of links with corruption were levelled against the prime min- ister. Particular anger was directed at Asian businesses active in forest management, particularly the Taiwanese. During these riots Honiara\u2019s Chinatown among other places, was destroyed. A new prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare (who was still in office when The Courier visited) seemed to meet with the rioter\u2019s approval and was elected. However, his relations with some sections of the international community (particularly Australia) were very strained. The main reason for this was his appointment to government of two figures who were accused of involvement in organising the riots. The European Union dis- approval came in a statement published in May 2006. Under internation- al pressure, these appointments were finally overturned but relations with Australia remained acrimonious due to other contested appointments. Mr Sogavare had previously been prime minister in the wake of a coup d\u2019e- tat in 2000 until December 2001. On 13 December, a no-confidence vote in parliament forced Sogavare to resign and on 20 December he was replaced by Derek Sikua. Sogavare is now opposition leader. Rarely since the 1999 crisis has a change of gov- ernment been so peaceful and violence-free in both the towns and sur- rounding countryside. For the new prime minister and his government, this is a sign that the democratic institutions have gained in strength: \u201cthe recent political leadership crisis has demonstrated the strength of our fun- damental democratic institutions to ensure a just and democratic outcome.\u201d Indeed, since the arrival of the RAMSI forces, the rules of democracy have been respected but often in a volatile atmosphere and fairly serious unrest. This does not bode well for a total resolution of the crisis and the eventual departure of the RAMSI forces. Nevertheless, many people saw the applause of the crowds on Malaita for the new prime minister as a sign of the beginning of genuine national reconciliation. It is to be hoped that the present d\u00e9tente is not followed by further prevarication and hic- cups on the road to democracy. (cid:2) 1 The Biketawa Declaration, adopted in October 2000 by the Pacific Islands Forum, laid the basis for a coordinated response to regional crises. Round up Occhiello J os\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, has called on EU Member States to up their respective Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) if the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are to be met. They include halving extreme global poverty by 2015. Barroso told a Brussels press conference 9 April: \u201cWe are doing well on aid effectiveness but we have to be honest and admit that our 2007 aid volume performance is simply not good enough.\u201d The call for more aid is contained in part an EU paper, \u2018EU as a global partner for development\u2019 released by Barroso 9 April to get talks started on a common EU position for the High Level Forum of Aid Effectiveness in Accra, Ghana in September and the Doha Financing for Development Conference in December. For the first time since 2000 the combined overseas aid from 27 EU Member States to all developing nations fell to \u20ac 46.1 billion in 2007 compared with \u20ac 47.7 billion in 2006. Recent figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reveal that aid fell in 2007 from the following states who are traditionally large con- tributors by volume: Belgium (-11.2 per cent), France (-15.9 per cent), Italy (-3.6 per cent), Portugal (-9.4 per cent), Sweden (-2.6 per cent) and the United Kingdom (-29.1 per cent). The following states gave more in 2007: Germany (+5.9 per cent), Ireland (+4.6 per cent), Luxembourg (+11.7 per cent), Spain (+33.8 per cent), Austria (+7.6 per cent), Denmark (+2.9 per cent), Finland (+5.5 per cent), Greece (+5.3 per cent) and the Netherlands (+3.1 per cent). President Barroso said the European Commission had a leadership role in meeting the MDGs and asked Member States to specify annual development spending up to 2015. This message would be taken to the June meeting of EU Heads of State in Slovenia and the group of eight most industrialised nations (G8) in July in Japan, he said. Member States were also asked to contribute to a new annual European Commission annual budget line of \u20ac 2 billion for \u2018Aid for Trade\u2019 up to 2010, half of which will come from the Commission and the rest from EU Member States. It will finance such as infrastructure to boost regional trade in developing nations and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states are expected to be big beneficiaries. Larger amounts of aid are just one part of the \u2018global partner\u2019 paper which also stresses improved aid effectiveness. Here a lot of progress had been made with EU Member States taking joint planning decisions, Louis Michel, EU Commissioner for Development, told journalists on 9 April. In Somalia six EU countries and Norway coordinate aid. Michel also gave his backing to budget support which created, \u201ca relationship of confidence between equals.\u201d Forty-seven per cent of the \u20ac 22.6 bil- lion 10th EDF (2008-2013) is earmarked for budget aid in ACP nations. And the paper urges more synergy between development and other EU policies to avoid sit- uations where they are at odds with eachother, a case in point being biofuels.

        "Dossier Fishing 10 D ossier T he fishing sector in the coastal states of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific is going through turbulent times and facing multiple challenges. These include whether to include the sector in the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), put- ting in place adequate structures to ensure sustainable fishing by both local and foreign fleets (particularly European fleets), and the viability of local fisheries \u2013 vital in coastal countries such as Senegal, Mauritania and several Caribbean countries. As a backdrop to this there is the new proposal put forward by the European Commission in October 2007 to combat illegal fishing \u2013 an epidemic of such proportions that it has now become an international priority. Indeed, the challenges are so great that we decided in this dos- sier to focus on three pressing issues: the battle against illegal fishing, the exemplary partnership agreement on fishing between the EU and Mauritania, and local fishing activities. (cid:2) FISHING, in search of a sustainable model by Marie-Martine Buckens \u201cF or the ACP countries \u2013 and our relations with them \u2013 the issue of illegal fishing is of great importance,\u201d explains Cesar Deben. He continues, \u201c\u2026in as much as we are seeing an increase in this type of fishing and Europe plays a major role in the fact that we are the biggest growth market (even with the emergence of Russia and China) for quality pro- ducts.\u201d The EU is a big player in the international fish product industry. In 2003, the quantity imported by the then 25 Member States was more than 10 million tonnes totalling some \u20ac 24 billion. In the same year, the EU exported just 6 million tonnes of fish products \u2013 a total value of around \u20ac 14 billion. The EU is, hence, a net importer of these products and this is a growing trend. This is why, over a period of time, the EU has concluded fishing agreements with various ACP coastal states. They include mixed agreements (permitting different species to be caught), in particular with West African States close to European coast- lines (especially the Spanish coast), and tuna fishing agreements with Indian Ocean countries (primarily the Seychelles and the Comoros) and Open warfare on \u201cillegal, undeclared, unregulated\u201d fishing The EU has decided to attack a crisis head-on that could affect almost a fifth of the global volume of fishing: illegal practices. This initiative is headed by Cesar Deben Alfonso, Director of monitoring and implementation at the Directorate-General of Fishing and Maritime Affairs at the European Commission.

Above all, these agreements aim to ensure reg- ular stocks for the European fleet. However, the international market in fish products has grown to such a size that ever-increasing num- bers of pirates roam the seas, lured by the lucrative profits to be made by those who don\u2019t observe the rules (fishing methods and quotas) which are imposed on legal boats. > An enormous task \u201cThere are three reasons why we are tackling this enormous task,\u201d says Cesar Deben. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s about preserving a resource. Secondly, the rules that we put on the table in October 2007 offer a framework of coopera- tion, particularly with ACP countries, as they are the primary victims since they lack the structural capability to confront this threat and deal with corruption. Therefore we must bear in mind that controlling fishing activity involves huge costs that many countries are unable to meet. Thirdly, we want to put European fleets on an equal footing with third- country fleets.\u201d He continues, \u201cOur fleets are the most regulated in the world and they must be allowed to operate under conditions of fair competition.\u201d The toughness of the regulation is illustrated by the requirement for EU boats to carry a \u2018blue box\u2019 on board (so they can be located by satellite) and an electronic logbook, to be in general use from 2009. However, Cesar Deben recognises that illegal fishing affects all fleets, whether in the form of companies created in third countries or the use of certain flags of convenience. > Restrictive measures To date, the EU has backed the adoption of various measures of regional fishing organisa- tions to combat illegal fishing, but this is the first time that legally binding measures (in the form of EU Council rulings) can be adopted by European Fisheries Ministers. So, what are they? The first is aimed at attacking the status of flags of convenience. Notes Deben: \u201cThe Maritime Law states that countries are responsible for the activities of ships that sail under their flags and we have to ensure that this obligation is fully upheld.\u201d Happily, says Deben, cases are becoming rarer as countries like Equatorial Guinea, the Dominican Republic, Belize and Panama abandon the practice. \u201cBut there are still many others.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe want to deal with this on two fronts. Firstly to compel states to strengthen their controls \u2013 if they don\u2019t coop- erate we will not accept their products at European ports. Then we want to change the legal framework by reversing the burden of proof, so that boats wishing to export to Europe must prove that their catches are legal \u2013 normal practice in the United States. To make this possible, the rules provide for a cer- tification mechanism, which already exists for tuna fishing, and countries that don\u2019t cooper- ate could be \u2018decertified\u2019.\u201d So, it will not be a case of drawing up a black- list of pirate boats, but rather of withdrawing an automatic right. \u201cThere are already ade- quate rules, adding a legal requirement suf- fices,\u201d says Deben. > Accompanying measures \u201cThe mechanisms to make this work,\u201d contin- ues Cesar Deben, \u201cmust also respect World Trade Organisation rules, and must not have negative repercussions for developing country exporters. The main ACP exporters of fish products to Europe are South Africa and Namibia, followed by various West African countries, specifically Mauritania. On that basis it is estimated that 80 per cent of fish products stay in Africa as frozen products.\u201d Many of these exporting countries are also the main victims of illegal fishing and the Asian fleets that fish without a licence in their waters have become a real scourge. The EU is now drawing up financial incentives to help coun- tries maintain legal fishing activities. Financial aid is included in the Partnership Agreements drawn up between the EU and some ACP states (destined, admittedly, to become fewer in number). Suggests Deben: \u201cWe can expect long delays while waiting for countries to fall in line just like with the accompanying measures, espe- cially in the training of customs officers.\u201d These measures could be funded by the European Development Fund (EDF) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). \u201cOverall these proposals have been well received, both by NGOs and the European Parliament, as well as the European Economic and Social Committee,\u201d concludes Cesar Deben. And not just by the Europeans, but also by the EU\u2019s prime competitors in the sector, notably Norway, the United States and China. Even the Chinese seem willing to cooperate \u2013 an important factor since the rules envisage the creation of an international network. M.M.B . (cid:2) New Partnership AGREEMENTS The EU\u2019s former \u2018fish, pay and go\u2019 policy for bilateral fishing agreements with ACP countries is no more. It has been replaced by Fishing Partnership Agreements (FPA) focused on sustainable development. T he introduction of these FPAs is for both commercial and ecological reasons. The new generation of agreements addresses the ongoing over-exploitation of resources. According to the European Commission, new World Trade Organisation (WTO) regulations on aid to the fishing industry do not mean that the, \u201cEU\u2019s financial contribution should be considered as a subsidy for European fishermen.\u201d It goes on to say that \u201c\u2026. in future, the EU\u2019s financial contribution will have to be regarded as an investment to ensure responsible fishing and therefore be based on new considerations\u201d. This transformation of fishing agreements into Fishing Partnership Agreements is a recent development \u2013 most of the FPAs have only been in place for a year. But some things haven\u2019t changed. The main aim of the FPAs, as with the former previous bilateral agreements, is to provide European fleets with access to the territorial waters of certain coastal states. In the 1970s most coastal states established exclusive economic zones, extending their jurisdiction at sea from a distance of between 3 and 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles. This move put almost 90 per cent of the world\u2019s fish stocks under the control of these coastal states. As a result, the fishing fleets of the EU Member States, which traditionally operated in the waters of third countries, suddenly found themselves exclud- ed from these areas. To solve this issue, the EU signed fishing agreements with the third coun- tries involved to ensure access for its fleets. In addition, ever since Spain and Portugal joined the EU in 1986, their national bilateral agree- ments have gradually been replaced by the EU agreements. However, national bilateral agree- ments are still in place where the EU does not have fishing agreements, for example with South Africa. > Ensuring access According to the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), the EU\u2019s policy on fishing in third countries \u2013 aimed at protecting the EU\u2019s interests in the fishing sector \u2013 has been the driving force in Keywords Marie-Martine Buckens; illegal fishing; Cesar Deben; European Commission; ACP; WTO; European fleet.

        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 Dossier Fishing 15 14 ACP-EU relations in the fishing industry. The EU concluded 14 fishing agreements with ACP countries in July 2007 involving the payment of financial compensation. In return, the EU fleets obtained access to resources that, in the- ory, are not used by the coastal state concerned and are often referred to as \u2018surplus resources\u2019. > Primarily Spanish interests A study carried out in 2005 by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) gave the main reasons for the EU sign- ing fishing agreements as: - to supply the EU\u2019s fish processing industry with raw materials. This took into account the huge demand on the EU market and the poor supply in EU waters mainly caused by overfishing. Currently, the EU has to import about 60 per cent of the fish it consumes and since 2000 has had to import an additional 9 million tonnes of fish annually to meet the demand of the fish processing industry and EU consumers. The added value created by the ACP-EU agreements through the pro- cessing and sale of fish in the Member States is estimated at \u20ac 694 million. - to maintain fishing capacity outside EU waters. In the 1990s, the ACP-EU fishing agreements authorised 800 EU vessels to fish in the waters of developing countries. This fishing, created through the ACP-EU agreements, has increased over the years for technological reasons. - to protect employment in the EU. Some 35,000 jobs depend on the ACP-EU fishing agreements, mainly in the EU\u2019s fish process- ing industry. The Spanish are the main beneficiaries of the agreements between the ACP countries and the EU, with more than 80 per cent of the added value and the employment. Additionally, France and Portugal receive about 7 per cent. In 2006, the total budget of the fishing agree- ments was \u20ac 240M and expenditure in 2006 on the main ACP-EU fishing agreements was: - \u20ac 86M for the EU-Mauritania agreement; - \u20ac 7.2M for the EU-Guinea-Bissau agreement; - \u20ac 4.12M for the EU-Seychelles agreement; - \u20ac 3.9M for the EU-Guinea agreement. Fish stocks in the waters of the ACP coastal states of interest to the EU fleets can be divided into three main categories: - Demersal species: mainly octopus, sole, prawns, snapper, hake; - Small pelagic species: sardinellas, horse mackerel/scads, sardines, pilchards; - All tuna species. > The FPAs: root of all evil? Some observers believe that the new Fishing Partnership Agreements the EU is currently negotiating with ACP coastal countries (to replace bilateral agreements) will be the \u201croot of all evil\u201d and will only further encourage illegal fishing. The CTA disagrees, highlighting the example of Spanish trawlers fishing in South African waters with the approval of the South African Marine and Coastal Management (MCM), who get around the reduction in the quantities of hake fished (required by current quotas) by processing the hake into sausage. The CTA points out that, \u201cin the case of South Africa, the absence of a fishing agreement has not prevented some European ship owners from accessing South African fishing waters\u201d. They conclude that, \u201cPrivate agreements often result in situations that are neither beneficial to the local populations in the ACPnor to levels of fish stocks.\u201d M.M.B . (cid:2) Dossier Fishing I n December 2007, the European Commission revoked the agreement between the EU and Mauritania, as \u201cEU ship owners were not making full use of the opportunities for fishing.\u201d A series of techni- cal meetings have since been planned to ensure the new agreement is, in the words of the Commission, \u201cmore in line with the size of the EU fishing fleet in Mauritanian waters and better meets Mauritania\u2019s require- ments with regard to the development of its national fishing sector.\u201d On 19 February this year, EU fisheries ministers gave their backing to the Commission to determine \u201cfishing opportunities for EU vessels in such a way as to ensure a balance between these quotas and the financial reim- bursement to Mauritania. \u201d In short, this meant reviewing the EU\u2019s finan- cial contribution to allow its fleets to fish in Mauritanian waters. The EU Council of Ministers also indicated that the two parties should engage in \u201cconsultation to ensure the adoption of measures aimed at sustainable management of Mauritanian marine resources, taking into account the best scientific opinion available in particular over the state of fish stocks.\u201d The initial Fishing Partnership Agreement (FPA) between the EU and Mauritania was drawn up in 1987. The latest agreement was concluded for the period 2006-2012. The protocol establishing fishing opportunities and financial reimbursement was signed for a period of two years and entered into force on 1 August 2006. At the end of the first year of this agreement, the European Commission indicated that the fishing opportunities granted to the Member States were insufficient. The EU-Mauritania Fishing Partnership Agreement is designed to set an example. It is the most important fishing agreement that the European The controversial example of MAURITANIA Providing access to resources and ensuring sustainable development at the same time can sometimes prove impossible.

In return, about 200 vessels from Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Latvia cur- rently have the right to fish in Mauritanian waters. But the FPAshould also set a precedent in attempts to control the key issue of the overexploitation of resources (the present agreement provides the right to fish for crus- taceans, prawns, hake and other demersal species, as well as small pelag- ic species, tuna and cephalopods). > The spectrum of overexploitation In December 2007, 20 fishing boats from the Spanish Association of Cephalopod Fishing (ANACEF), fishing cephalopods under the current EU- Mauritania agreement, decided to stop their operations owing to losses. According to the association, this was because of inappropriate technical measures written into the agreement. The ANACEF specifically highlighted the minimum size set for catches of cephalopods (500g), which it considers too high and says forced it to fish outside the six-mile limit. It has now been involved in a battle with the Mauritanian authorities for several months to obtain the right to fish for sizes that are prohibited commercially. The Spanish also complain that they have been prevented access to young cephalopods unless they pay heavy compensation. According to ANACEF, the Spanish boats returning home will mean the direct loss of 340 jobs and a further 1,600 indirect job losses. Furthermore, supplies will be disrupted to the Spanish, Italian and Japanese markets that will be deprived of the seven tonnes of cephalopods usually brought back from Mauritania by these boats (a tonne of octopus can fetch US$7,000-8,000). However, mindful of the concern of over-fishing, the scientific committee of the Mauritanian Ocean and Fisheries Research Institute (IMROP) launched a campaign several months ago designed to protect the regeneration of cephalopods. Currently, all the fleets working in Mauritanian waters, both local and for- eign, are continually recording losses due to the overexploitation of cephalopods. Therefore the main aim of the agreement, according to the Belgian Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), should be to help Mauritania adjust its fishing capacity to the resources available, maintaining the principle that the European fleets can only have access to the surplus resources that cannot be fished locally. The centre also says that it is vital for the EU to continue its efforts to help Mauritania establish a sustainable development policy for the fishery sector. > The importance of cephalopods Cephalopods, and octopus in particular, are one of Mauritania\u2019s major fishing resources. The Mauritanian Fish Marketing Company (SMCP), which sells all of the frozen demersal species and cephalopods brought in by the national fleet, exported 40,000 tonnes of fish worth almost \u20ac 119M in 2004. Octopus, which alone accounts for 51.2 per cent of this total export tonnage (with a value of almost \u20ac 98M), makes up 82 per cent of SMCP\u2019s turnover. Moreover, the Mauritanian octopus is equal- ly important for the European fishing industry. In 2004, the European cephalopod trawlers comprised 33 per cent of the turnover generated within the framework of the fishing agreement (compared to 38 per cent for small pelagic species and 16 per cent for prawn trawlers). > The arrival of the Chinese Since the beginning of the 1990s when fishing for octopus began its sharp growth, there has also been a huge influx of Chinese vessels into the local fleet as part of its modernisation programme, despite the warn- ings of CNROP and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) about fish stocks being unable to withstand such pressure. The arrival of the EU cephalopod trawlers between 1994 and 1996 further accelerated the depletion of stocks and the subsequent decline in landings. B\u00e9atrice Gorez, spokesperson for CAPE, a non- governmental organisation campaigning for fair fishing agreements, explained that in 2006 the 125 vessels in the national fleet were main- ly of Chinese origin. In 2006, IMROP, which every four years brings together the leading international experts on Mauritanian fishing, estimated a 31 per cent excess the fishing of octopus, which means a decrease in production of 20 per cent. To achieve the goal of maximising income established by the Mauritanian policy, it would be necessary to reduce the fishing effort by 40 per cent to return it to the maximum economic level. According to CAPE, 43 licences for fishing octopus are assigned to European trawlers under the access provided by the current Mauritania- EU agreement. Compared with the previous agreement, the most recent figures available show that only 46 of the 55 licences provided for by the 2001-2006 agreement were used during the first quarter of 2005 due to a lack of resources. According to CAPE, the 46 licences are set to fall to 43, representing a decrease of 6.5 per cent. It is difficult to under- stand how this modest decline adds up to the fall of 30 per cent in the European fishing effort, which is what has been officially announced. M.M.B . (cid:2) Dossier Fishing New agreement with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire O n 20 February 2008, the EU Council of Ministers gave the go- ahead for a new fishing partnership with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. This agreement, considerably less sizeable than that between the EU and Mauritania, stipulates an annual financial contribution from the EU of \u20ac 455,000. The fishing quotas established by this agree- ment, for the period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2013 (with retroactive effect), will be divided between the Member States as follows: - 25 seiners: Spain (15 vessels) and France (10 vessels); - 15 surface long liners: Spain (10 vessels) and Portugal (5 vessels). The financial contribution made by the EU corresponds to a refer- ence tonnage of 7,000 tonnes per year and an annual sum of \u20ac 140,000 to assist with the implementation of the Ivorian govern- ment\u2019s fishing policy. The new agreement aims to replace the one concluded in 1990 on fishing off C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The agreement also contains a revision clause which allows for amendments to the agreement after three years if necessary.

        "18 Dossier Fishing Dossier Fishing 19 O verall, small-scale \u2013 or traditional fishing \u2013 provides over 80 per cent of direct and indirect jobs in the sector. Small-scale fishing in the ACP countries is also vital to the traditional pro- cessing activities that ensure a supply of fish to local and regional markets. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, FAO statistics show that small-scale fishing accounts for up to 80 per cent of the fish landed for direct human consumption. In West Africa, small-scale fishing also plays an important role in the growth of fresh fish supplies to lucrative interna- tional markets, such as Europe, the United States and Asia. In 2006, at a meeting of European shipowners where they looked at how they could contribute to the sustainable development of ACP coun- tries, Mozambique\u2019s fisheries minister spoke of the need for Europe to \u201cbetter understand the problems facing countries when they seek to manage their fisheries in a sustainable manner.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe principal struggle is the struggle against total poverty and the fishing sector has a major role to play in this struggle.\u201d He ended by stressing that, \u201cin this respect, our principal objective is the integrated develop- ment of small-scale fishing.\u201d The fact that small-scale fishing is an effective tool in combating poverty is confirmed by all the coastal ACP states. Far from the bleak image conveyed by some, small-scale fishing is a dynamic sector engendering innovation and, with the right focus and support, can be a main player in meeting the challenges of the new millennium. One of the major challenges for ACP countries is to restore fragile ecosystems and fish stocks depleted by intensive and harmful fishing meth- ods. Given fish shortages, ACP fishermen must now commit to qualitative rather than quantita- tive fishing, prioritising methods that respect both the marine environment and product quali- ty. A clear link between product quality and the catches of traditional fishing fleets has already been established. In Mauritania, for example, the superiority of small-scale fishing in terms of the quality and adding value to a product is a constant factor. In 2005, octopus caught using traditional Mauritanian fishing vessels sold for US$200 more per tonne than that caught by refrigerated trawlers. As for the noble seabed species, only the product of small-scale fishing provides the quality for export to Europe, reach- ing an average price of \u20ac 4.5 per kg. The frozen fish \u2013 produced by the industrial fishing chain \u2013 sells at under \u20ac 2 per kg. Giving priority to investment in small and medium-sized businesses in the ACP small- scale fishing sector \u2013 as well as the service sectors and infrastructure (ports, access to pro- cessing sites and use of appropriate technolo- gies) \u2013 enables this industry to maximise its full potential in both combating poverty and ensuring food safety. This should be at the heart of measures governing EU involvement in the ACP fishing sector.

In many cases, processing does not real- ly add any value to the product at all. The opposite is often the case, in that fish quickly lose their value once they leave the water. So, to optimise the value of catches, the product must be kept alive and fresh for as long as possible..

        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 21 20 Q uality assurance begins at sea from the moment the fish leave the water, which is why we must work to improve the quality of our fleet. So now local fishermen take a positive view on the gradual replacement of the traditio- nal wooden pirogue with fibreglass versions. And this change could turn out to be a positive move, as our country is now facing deforestation and it requires two large trees to make one woo- den pirogue. More than that, wooden pirogues require frequent and costly maintenance \u2013 they need to be repaired every six months. The new, fibreglass pirogues are also cleaner and lighter than the traditional boats, are better equipped for storing and preserving fish, and are easier to maintain. They also use less fuel, some- thing to bear in mind at a time when fuel costs are an increasing burden on our livelihoods. > Modern boats and hygiene But replacing wooden pirogues with fibreglass is expensive for the fishermen, given that a fibreglass pirogue costs more than twice as much as a wooden one. Therefore, to ensure the gradual renewal of our fleet, and make sure that this option is not only available to those who can afford boats, specific aid or credit mechanisms must be available. However, replacing wooden pirogues with fibreglass ones will not solve the cleanliness issue if the local fishing industry does nothing about changing its methods for handling fish. Today, most of the people handling fish on the boats, as well as the many women involved in the industry (including those on the landing quays), are not well enough informed about the requirements for traceability and cleanliness, and what that means in terms of changing their daily working habits. To meet these require- ments, information and training are needed. Many of the people involved in the industry have no command of French; however the majority are perfectly competent in their national language, both written and spoken. It should therefore be possible to draw up procedures in their national language to allow people in the industry to com- plete the necessary documents and provide accu- rate information. In fact, the \u2018point of first sale\u2019 (the landing quays) is the perfect location for bringing together all the elements required to improving traceability of fish catches. > The vital role played by the consumer We can already see significant changes that have taken place in both the professionalism and the specialisation of people with responsibility for traceability and cleanliness. For example, the polystyrene boxes for storing the fish on board the boats are no longer cleaned by the fishermen themselves, but by men and women who spe- cialise in this work and have acquired the skills to ensure a high level of cleanliness. Similarly, drivers of refrigerated trucks (who transport the fish from the landing quays to Dakar) are now members of an association and have undergone training in transporting fish in the best way possible. This involves, amongst other things, individual approval ratings in recognition of their specialisation. There is an enormous task ahead, particularly in the improvement of working and handling con- ditions for locally processed products that are sold throughout the sub-region. And the prob- lems are numerous: cleanliness and hygiene at processing sites; the efforts required by local authorities to collect rubbish regularly; the pro- vision of drainage and drinking water at these sites; issues concerning the packing of the mer- chandise and so on. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the responsibilities of consumers and the need to educate them about sustainable fishing, as well as the need to combat illegal fishing. On the one hand, consumers want a good quali- ty, wholesome product. On the other hand, they are still not interested in knowing whether the product is legally caught or not. For example, the consumer wants a 300g fish on their plate even though the law stipulates that in order to preserve stocks the minimum permitted size is 400g. The fisherman will then do his utmost to meet consumer demand, even if this means breaking the law and forging the required trace- ability documents. It is also the case that many hotels demand young, small fish, especially with species such as white grouper, sea bream, prawns, etc., even if this goes against the Senegalese Code of Fishing. But this is also the case in Spain, where, during our visit to the market in Barcelona, we saw young fish of species from our regions on sale. That is why consumers and customers \u2013 includ- ing hotels \u2013 must be informed and made aware of their responsibilities in relation to their demand for fish products. These should fall in line with the laws and regulations linked to conservation. (cid:2) * Vice President of the Inter-professional National Council for Local Fishing in Senegal (CONIPAS).

As you can imagine, the list of people who have played either an ad hoc role or a key part throughout the years is a very long one and all the Courier can do is offer an overview. So let\u2019s begin by naming one of the founders: the legendary head of protocol and head of the press office for the ACP Group, Alpha Niaka Bary. Sengalese, Niaka Bary was famed both for his speed at solving a whole host of problems as well as for his amazing collection of walking sticks! His fellow countryman, Seydina Oumar Sy, former Ambassador and a Minister for Foreign Trade and Affairs, was involved in all the talks on the various Lom\u00e9 Conventions. From the same era, and heading the ACP negotiating team during the first Lom\u00e9 Convention, the Nigerian Ambassador, Olu Sanu was noted for his dogged determination. Royalty had its place too, with the House of Windsor\u2019s Princess Anne making her mark on the cooperation process during the September 1985 meeting in Inverness. There she urged the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly to do more than just talk about aid and to make it effective. Leading polit- ical figures such as the French Home Affairs Minister, Michel Poniatowski, also made a significant contribution. On the eve of Lom\u00e9 III, in his role as Chair of the European Parliament\u2019s Development Committee, he made a call for a renewal of the cooperation policy. The architects of Lom\u00e9 also include Edgar Pisani (European Commissioner for Development, 1981-1984), the father of the political dialogue with the ACP countries: the focus on rural development and food security was a reflection of his earlier experience with France\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture. History will also record Lorenzo Natali\u2019s appointment as Commissioner for Development in 1985, ending what appeared to be a French monopoly of this post. He was followed by Manuel Marin (1989) of Spain, Jo\u00e3o de Deus Pinheiro (1994) of Portugal, Poul Nielson (1999) of Denmark and Louis Michel (2004) of Belgium. FIGUREHEADS of ACP-EU cooperation Fran\u00e7ois Misser, Hegel Goutier and Andrea Marchesini As much as being measured by results, cooperation is the outcome of democratic debate. However, results of those debates are all down to one thing, individual men and women. While it may not be possible to name every last individual involved over the years in ACP-EU cooperation, here the Courier attempts to showcase a gallery of some of the leading voices in those discussions and debates.

        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 > Michel Rocard THE TABOO - BREAKER Known for his commitment to the campaign against the war in Algeria, and as a supporter of New Caledonia\u2019s right to self-determi- nation, Michel Rocard has contin- ued to wage a fight within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly\u2019s (JPA) Development Committee and as member of the European Parliament\u2019s Development Committee in a bid to lift one or two taboos or barriers that he believes get in the way of today\u2019s reality. These include trafficking in arms, precious stones and human beings being confused, under the head- ing of \u201c informal\u201d trade, within economies of the ACP countries.Another taboo, he claims, is the \u201cmisleading and dangerous idea\u201d that \u201cthe key to development in Africa is having its products gain access to markets in the developed countries.\u201d This, even though, \u201ctwo-thirds of African countries have nothing to export and the oil revenue being earmarked for develop- ment in the other countries has failed to deliver anything.\u201d Rocard also continues to stress the need to protect food agriculture owing to the decline of food self-sufficiency in Africa. > Louis Michel TURNS THE SPOTLIGHT ON INFRASTRUCTURE At the helm of Europe\u2019s Development Cooperation policy since 2004, Commissioner Louis Michel, a former Belgian Foreign Minister , has already made his mark on relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) partners. First and fore- most, under his leadership the European Commission has boost- ed the level of direct aid to ACP States\u2019 budgets to create a greater sense of ownership and a bigger sense of responsibility in adminis- tering EU-sponsored development programmes. Moreover, it is under his guidance and that of his colleague, Peter Mandelson, European Commissioner for Trade, that Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are due to be concluded with ACP during 2008. These agree- ments should boost regional trade, attract much-needed investment whilst taking into account development needs of the ACP countries. A key element of Louis Michel\u2019s policy to reach the Millennium Development Goals has been to focus on support to infrastructure, par- ticularly in Africa, so as to give ACP partners the means to become competitive and generate wealth for their citizens. > Giovanni Bersani BUILDING - BRIDGES BETWEEN THE EU AND ACP Law graduate, activist against Nazism and fascism in Italy, after World War II, Giovanni Bersani was among the founders of the Italian Movement of Christian workers, vice-president of the ACLI and Italian parliamentarian for seven terms. He was undersec- retary of the Ministry of Work during De Gasperi\u2019s government in 1952-1953. As a Member of the European Parliament from 1960, he was especial- ly involved in external relations, particularly with Africa, to develop a European policy of peace through strong relations, towards the end of the sixties. The aim of his political activity was to affirm Europe, according to the spirit of the founding fathers, as a civil and moral power rather than a military force. He was then vice-president of the Development Committee and mem- ber of the External Economic Relations Committee of the European Parliament. At first he joined the Christian Democratic Party, subse- quently moving to the European People\u2019s Party parliamentarian group. From 1976 to 1989, he was President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly created by the Lom\u00e9 Convention and, at the end of his mandate he was appointed President Ad honorem for life. Since the 1980\u2019s he has devoted his political life to relationships with non-EU Mediterranean countries. In April 1989 he called upon the first Mediterranean Parliamentarian Assembly for \u201ca total cooperation.\u201d This assembly approved a permanent plan of cooperation in which a Joint Parliamentarian Assembly plays a central role, as was the case in the Lom\u00e9 conventions. > Glenys Kinnock A LEADING LIGHT Former teacher Glenys Kinnock was elected to the European Parliament in 1994 and re-elected in 1999 and 2004 as one of the MEPs representing Wales. She is a member of the European Parliament\u2019s Development and Cooperation Committee and Co- President of the Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) ensuring that its agenda is lively and to the point. As a fellow JPA member noted at the Wiesbaden JPAs in June 2007: \u201cOur meetings would just not be the same without her.\u201d President of the Non Governmental Organisation, One World Action and Patron of the Drop the Debt Campaign , her development activities extend beyond Parliamentary fora.

After leaving the Commission, Frisch continued to fuel the development debate as one of the founders of Transparency International, alongside with his German compatriot and former World Bank official, Peter Eigen, that campaigns against major corruption and the detrimental impact this has on development. He claims that one of the key lessons to be drawn from the Lom\u00e9 Conventions between the European Community (as it was at the time) and the ACP countries was that these were break- through pacts that launched a dynamic process leading to later agree- ments with the Mediterranean, Latin American and Asian countries. > Ghebray Berhane \u201c THE ACP COUNTRIES HAVE TO SEEK ANOTHER ASPIRATION \u201d Secretary-General of the ACP Group from 1990 to 1995, this Sorbonne doctor of law had 14 years of experience in EU-ACP cooperation as Ethiopia\u2019s Ambassador to the European insti- tutions from 1978 to 1987 where he negotiated the Lom\u00e9 III and Lom\u00e9 IV Conventions. And his involvement with devel- opment work continues as the head of an Addis Ababa-based firm offering legal advice and consultancy services.The firm has pro- vided expert knowledge to the Ethiopian Privatization Agency and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, while operating in the field of arbitration on behalf of the World Food Programme and the EU. Ghebray Berhane believes that while the ACP regions are committed to signing individual economic partnership agreements with the EU, the time is ripe for the ACP countries to find \u201ca new momentum, another aspiration\u201d. He says the ACP countries would be well advised to face up to the major challenges that cannot be addressed on a regional basis, such as climate change or the major health issues. > Claude Cheysson F ATHER OF L OM\u00c9 AND S TABEX A former Foreign Minister of France (1981 to 1984), Claude Cheysson is one of the architects of the EU\u2019s cooperation policy. In his capacity as European Commissioner for Development, he inaugurated the first Lom\u00e9 Convention (1975), which sig- nalled a radical change in cooper- ation. One key element was the contractual dimension ensuring that concessions granted could no longer be withdrawn. A further example was Lom\u00e9 being regarded as a gamble on the ACP partners\u2019 insistence of how their cooperation with the European Union is prioritised. What is more, Lom\u00e9 I was the first international cooper- ation agreement to usher in a compensatory finance scheme to stabilise the earnings of the ACP countries from their farm exports to the EU: Stabex. None of these decisions were surprising to a man who, ever since he joined the French diplomatic service at the end of the Second World War, understood the former colonies\u2019 desire for independence. An adviser to the Vietnamese President in 1952, Claude Cheysson was also a keen supporter of Algerian independence. And he returned from 1985 to 1988, as European Commissioner for Mediterranean Policy and North-South Relations, to nurture a vibrant Lom\u00e9 spirit and provide a further proactive push for cooperation with other countries. > Edwin Carrington THE PRAGMATIST The Tobagian economist Edwin Carrington spent 14 years with the ACP Secretariat, as Assistant Secretary-General (1976-1985) and as Secretary-General (1985- 1990). Regarded as one of the experts on the Lom\u00e9 Convention he was involved in all the negotia- tions. Later as Secretary-General of Caricom, from 1992 he has been able to keep close track of the evolving cooperation with the EU. We have no space here to sum up the hours and hours of speeches Edwin Carrington has made on this subject but we should record the call he made (coinciding with the January 1982 issue of the Courier) for \u201can increasingly realistic assessment of what cooperation has the potential to offer. In a nutshell, the agreements by themselves do not offer any easy solutions to the woes of the ACP countries, even if they provide the sole framework for this type of cooperation. It is up to the ACP countries to discover the areas they can benefit from and as they themselves help to set the priorities they have to be regarded as bearing a responsibility\u2026\u201d Interaction Figureheads ACP-EU ",
        "25 T rade N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 25 T he threat of climate change associat- ed with global warning and higher oil prices are driving forward the use of alternative fuels like biofuels which produce less carbon emissions. Biofuels can be made from maize, soya, rapeseed, sugar cane and palm, and can either be used pure if an engine is adapted, or mixed with standard diesel and petrol. In March 2007, EU Heads of State and Government agreed that by 2020 10 per cent of all the EU\u2019s transport fuels will be from biofu- els from a sustainable source. A year on and a meeting of the biofuels\u2019 indus- try has said that production needs to be stepped up if this target is to be met. At the 13 March congress of World Biofuels Markets, Industry representative Olivier Schaeffer and Policy Chief at the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) said: \u201cI believe we can hit the target of 10 per cent. And the potential is much higher than this.\u201d In other Brussels meeting rooms in March, enthusiasm about the future for biofuels was more diluted. Participants at a European Parliament seminar, \u2018Biofuels \u2013 eco-saviours or destroyers\u2019, raised fears that more land turned over to grow crops for biofuels will mean less land cultivated for food crops and hikes in food prices. At the same meeting, the fact that huge tracks of forest to grow crops for biofuels will lead to a loss of biodiversity was clearly voiced. And Lester Brown, Director of the Washington- based Earth Policy Institute warned at the Brussels\u2019 launch of his book Plan B 3.0 Mobilizing to Save Civilisation : \u201cHistorically the food and energy economies were separate. But with so many ethanol distilleries now being built to convert grain into fuel, the two are merging. In this new situation the world price of grain is moving towards its oil equivalent value. Suddenly the world is facing a moral and polit- ical issue that has no precedent: should we use grain to fuel cars or to feed people?\u201d Predicted Brown: \u201cThe risk is that rising grain prices will lead to chaos in world grain markets and to food riots in low and middle-income countries that import grain.\u201d > Knee-jerk reaction Claire Wenner, Head of the London-based Biofuels Renewable Energy Association said at the meeting of biofuel industrialists: \u201cBiofuels use about one per cent of global land available for agriculture (the figure is slightly higher across Europe). For Wenner, \u201cthere is a real danger that blaming biofuels will become a knee-jerk reaction that stops us from dealing with the much larger issues of food and energy needs over the next 50 years.\u201d At the European Parliament conference, others called for more investment in so-called \u2018second generation\u2019 biofuels like jatropha, a woody shrub producing inedible golf ball-sized fruit with seeds containing oil that can be turned into biodiesel and \u2013 a big plus \u2013 which can be grown on waste land. Meanwhile countries like Sierra Leone face decisions. Interviewed by The Courier in Freetown, Agriculture Minister Dr Sam Sesay said he had received many requests from investors in palm oil, but cautioned: \u201cFirstly we want to concentrate on satisfying domestic needs before we start to think about exports. But we don\u2019t want palm oil to reduce other crops like rice, coffee and cocoa. We need a bal- ance to make sure that we do not lose other important crops.\u201d D.P.

Equally, others did not hold out much hope for much cooperation between ACP countries at the end of the trade talks that were to take place. However, Goulongana was quick to size up the situation, realising that the group\u2019s strength was conditional upon the abilities of the Secretariat, which itself was down to its stand-alone status and above all its depoliticisation. Above all, the Secretary General\u2019s role is to serve the states and supervise the group and Goulongana took on this task, rallying flagging spirits whenever there was a risk of losing momentum. While he might describe himself as a servant, he is, in reality, more of a conductor - the musicians play and he sets the tempo. His skills as a negotiator, reconciler and facilitator have helped the Group out of some tight corners and allowed the ACP-EU cooperation process to clear one or two hurdles, to say the least. He has fiercely argued the case of the ACP countries, yet never failed to pay close attention to their partner\u2019s viewpoints. Goulongana brought these conciliatory skills to bear in several areas, including the \u201cpolitical dialogue\u201d between the EU and the ACP coun- tries on human rights, the EPA negotiations, and the WTO consulta- tions. Time and again he has proved to be a master in managing the fol- low-up to negotiations between often disparate parties. > Sir John Kaputin H ANDLING CHANGE Appointed Secretary General of the ACP Group of States on March 1, 2005, Sir John Kaputin is a lawyer with a lengthy track record of polit- ical service as an MP in his home country for 30 years (Papua New Guinea from 1972 to 2002). A knowledgeable expert on the finer points of ACP-EU cooperation, he has been involved in the Lom\u00e9 Conventions and the Cotonou Agreement since 1978 and was Joint President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly from 1995 to 1997. Sir John joined his government early in his political career and stayed almost constantly from 1973 to 2002 in a series of ministerial posts (Justice, Planning and Development, Finance, Mines, Energy, Foreign Affairs) and eventually as Minister for International Financial Institutions.

That one became a very big hit. People so fell in love with that song because it said what they wanted to say and couldn\u2019t.\u201d Fisher went on to produce a solo album, Borbor Bele for Emmerson Bockarie. Its title track also hit a public nerve. \u201cIt means a human being with a huge stomach, or you are embezzling money, that\u2019s why your stomach is so big.\u201d Fisher claims the song brought down the last government. So has he ever been cen- sored? \u201cNever,\u201d he replies. Fisher explains his musical blend: \u201cMost of the young guys are into the hip-hop, Notorious B.I.G and Tupac, all the rap stuff, so I thought why not bring the rap into the local language, Krio, and blend the hip-hop beat with Caribbean and Jamaican type of music. At first people laughed. Now everybody\u2019s playing it.\u201d Many young people in Sierra Leone are now trying to make money out of music. Fisher fears some of what is produced is sub-stan- dard. He also intends to do something about piracy. You just have to go to any crossroads to get hold of a cheap, copied compilation for just 4,000 Leones \u2013 under US$2. \u201cWe\u2019ve formed an organisation, the National Association of Performing Artists (NAPA).There is an anti-piracy law but the problem is that it\u2019s outdated. So if you take somebody who has been pirating your stuff to court you will end up spending more than what the court will award you. We are going to use the power of music again to change things. We haven\u2019t got the name of the song yet. They have to bring that law into full functionality.\u201d Fisher is working on two albums, one of which is dedicated to children and is to be sung most- ly by kids from an orphanage. Sierra Leone has signed up to the Child Rights Bill of the United Nations, he says, but parliament has yet to ratify it. \u201cThe focus will be on getting parliament to sit up and pass that bill. Basic education is supposed to be free but when you go to school there are so many charges, like buying books, that you find out that you are spending more than if it was not free.\u201d He\u2019s also brought on the current hottest female star in Sierra Leone, DJ Lulu: \u201cShe went through a lot of things as a kid. She is of mixed race. Her father is Lebanese and her mother is Sierra Leonean. But the Lebanese Community doesn\u2019t like those kinds of relationships. Her father died when she was very young so the Lebanese side of her relatives decided to push her out so she struggled for herself. She has a song about the way she grew up, Na Me Kam So. She is saying: \u201cYou thought I wouldn\u2019t get here but here I am.\u201d He\u2019s also busy with videos for Search for Common Ground on local governance. Local council elections will be held in July 2008. \u201cWhat we are doing is going to locations across the regions and capturing footage of how councils are performing and trying to compare them with other councils so when they have council workshops with councillors from different areas they can play these videos and the people can comment and say, this council is doing good with their money, or this council is not performing.\u201d The aim is to give people a voice for change. Another of Fisher\u2019s concern is a guarantee of a government of unity including all tribes: \u201cThis is going to be the subject of one of my songs.\u201d It\u2019s around 7 pm and Fisher leaves his studio to hang out with \u2018his men\u2019and drink a beer. After, he may watch an action film. And he\u2019ll have to find time, he says, to get his dancing legs working again for the launch of the new albums. D.P.

He\u2019s just back from up country where he\u2019s been shooting videos to heighten public understanding of issues facing Sierra Leoneans. A passion for his nation and music immerse Fisher. Opportunities to relax are rare. It\u2019s a 6.30 start and after listening to BBC World News , it\u2019s straight to the studio to hook up new equipment for music and video production. For many Sierra Leoneans like King Fisher, aka Emrys Savage, the civil war altered the course of the future. The music scene in his coun- try took off during the decade-long conflict of the \u201990s, \u201cwhen every- thing else ceased to function.\u201d \u201cAt that time I was a DJ and we started having rap competitions. Most of the time, I was chosen to be the judge. At one of them I met a group called Black Roots . They were the first young group to play live music. I was so impressed that I made a promise to help with the albums. That was in 1995.\u201d In 1997, Fisher started to compose his own songs. He explains how the studio\u2019s name came about: \u201cThere was a British Forces broadcasting station, with a very powerful DJ who had a group of guys called the Bodyguard . I just took the name from them. I also saw the name kind of protecting against many things that were to come later.\u201d He speaks of the influence of Jimmy Bangura (aka Jimmy B), a Sierra Leonean with a record deal with EMI who spent most of his youth in the United States and South Africa, and was the first to bring digital equipment to Sierra Leone. He set up Paradise Recording Studio after the war in 2002 and gave the opportunity to young people, collectively known as the Paradise Family, to release the first album made in Sierra Leone. It was a big hit. \u201cI tried to get Black Roots into the Paradise Family but couldn\u2019t. But I made a promise to them that one day I would set up my own recording studio.\u201d Another door opened for Fisher when he was working for Search for Common Ground, a Sierra Leonean NGO with whom he has continued to work, shooting videos on issues of concern to Sierra Leoneans from health to tackling corruption. \u201cI met an expatriate guy who was setting up the digital equipment there.

        "SIERRA LEONE By Debra Percival To be able to switch on lights for the first time \u2013 earlier this year \u2013 brought expectation of change for those cit- izens of Freetown who were used to being in the dark. President Ernest Bai Koroma won a slim victory in the run-off elections in September 2007, and energy gen- eration remains a top priority. The Bumbuna hydro electric power plant project, which Koroma has himself described as, \u201cthe longest hydro project in human his- tory\u201d, should be completed this year and there is antic- ipation of other projects to boost output beyond Freetown to rural areas. Koroma has told the public that he will not stop \u201cuntil we are in a position of get- ting 100 megawatts for the country.\u201d It\u2019s now over five years since the end of a brutal 11-year diamond-fuelled conflict waged by rebels that displaced almost half the population, left tens of thousands dead and others suffering, and government bodies and the economy in tatters. Sierra Leone is still at the bottom of the United Nations\u2019 Human Development (UNDP) Index. Yet with the assis- tance of international donors, including the EU, is build- ing up government institutions and reforming all sectors of the economy: mining, agriculture and tourism for all Sierra Leoneans. N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 R eport 28 O ur Planet DAM UNDER CLOSE WATCH O n 7 January, the EIB agreed a US$136M (\u20ac92M) loan to the Ugandan company, Bujagali Energy Limited (BEL). BEL is responsible for the construction and operation of a dam and hydroelectric plant of 250-mega- watt capacity in Bujagali, on the Upper Nile, downstream from Lake Victoria. In addition to the EIB, other co-funders will be the International Finance Corporation (the World Bank subsidiary that grants loans to the private sector), the African Development Bank (ADB) and a group of European financial institutions. In all, the loan comes to the equivalent of \u20ac462M. This decision puts an end to the delays surrounding this project, which has been condemned by a coalition of local organi- sations, both international and Ugandan, and some riverside dwellers, due to its impact on the environment. The project promoters argue that the hydro- electricity produced on the Nile will be the cheapest energy option for a country like Uganda, which has no access to the sea and is one of the poorest African nations. Bujagali will in fact provide support for two other dams: the Nalubaale Dam, built by the British in the late 1950s, and the Kiira Dam, built by Kampala authorities in the 1990s. The EIB has stressed that these two dams do not have enough capacity to meet a growing demand for electricity and acknowledges that power outa- ges during periods of low water flow cause serious disruption to the country\u2019s economic activity. Building a third dam downstream will make it possible to increase electricity produc- tion and, better still, Bujagali will be reusing the water already used to produce electricity at the upstream dams. > A threat to the health of Lake Victoria? The Ugandan Dam Development Forum, a group of ten NGOs, has worries about the pro- ject\u2019s long-term viability. Drawing on a report by the American NGO International River Networks (IRN), the Forum believes that the dams are partly responsible for falling water levels in Lake Victoria. It is also concerned that no study has yet been carried out to assess the impact of climate change on the lake\u2019s hydrological health. A number of studies have subsequently been carried out to determine the project\u2019s environmental and social fall-out. For its part, the EIB says any environmental impact will be relatively limited. A study by Canadian consultants Burnside , commis- sioned by the World Bank, suggests that the Bujagaly project will not \u2018significantly\u2019impair the lake, nor the river\u2019s hydrology. It says that the only aspect of the project that requires con- tinual monitoring is changes to downstream water levels. The consultancy recommends the introduction of a management plan for this. Whatever the case, the EIB has promised that the project is \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 mon- itored with measures taken, if necessary, in line with stringent international standards which stipulate close consultation with the local population, local authorities and all other associations affected. M.M.B. (cid:2) DAM UNDER CLOSE WATCH Uganda\u2019s third dam on the Nile (positioned where the river flows out of Lake Victoria), should enable it to generate the energy it crucially lacks without any negative environmental effects. This is at least the conclusion of the impact study commissioned by the World Bank. In the wake of the study, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has decided to co-fund the project.

        "Report Sierra Leone 31 N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 abuse of power and mismanagement of the dia- mond resources were rife, both of which were triggering factors of the civil war that ensued. Former army corporal, Foday Sankoh, and his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) campaigned against Momoh, capturing towns on the border with Liberia. Its initial attacks were on the Kailahun District in the diamond-rich east. Another factor at the start of the conflict was war in neighbouring Liberia. Charles Taylor, then rebel leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, allegedly helped the RUF in return for Sierra Leonean diamonds. Due to the government\u2019s failure to deal with the rebels at the time, army captain Valentine Strasser launched a military coup sending Momoh into exile in Guinea in April 1992. Strasser formed the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), which was to last four years. > New elections By 1995, the rebels held much of the diamond- rich eastern province and were on the doorstep of Freetown. The NPRC allegedly hired merce- naries from the private security firm, Executive Outcomes , to repel the rebels. But there was unhappiness about the handling of the crisis and Strasser was subsequently ousted in a coup led by his defence minister, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio. Bio subsequently re-instated the constitution and called for elections. SLPP candidate, Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, was democratically elected and voted into office in 1996. An alleged attempt to overthrow Kabbah by Major General Johnny Koroma resulted in Koroma\u2019s trial and imprisonment. Unhappy with this decision, a group of soldiers, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), overthrew the president and released Koroma \u2013 who in turn became president and invited the RUF to join him in government on banning political parties, demonstrations and shutting down private radio. These moves led to UN Security Council sanc- tions in 1997 including banning arms and petro- leum products in 1997. In March 1998, the West African Peackeeping force, ECOMOG, rein- stalled Kabbah. The next year another attempt to overthrow the government by the AFRC, with RUF backing, left 5,000 dead in Freetown and widespread devastation. > UNMSIL In October 1999, UN peacekeepers restored order and disarmed rebel forces. A total of 17,000 \u2018blue helmets\u2019 of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNMSIL) were even- tually sent to the country, describes Christian Holger Stohmann, Information Officer with the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) in Freetown. The ensuing 1999 ceasefire and peace agreement in the Togolese capital of Lom\u00e9 ensured positions in government for the rebels. But Sam Bokari, one of the rebel leaders, retali- ated against the presence of UN troops who were attacked and abducted in the east. Acontin- gent of 800 British paratroopers arrived to secure the airport for the peacekeepers and Foday Sankoh was captured. In May 2001, the disarmament of rebels began with the aid of Sierra Leone\u2019s national army. In January 2002, war was officially over. The SLPP\u2019s Kabbah won a landslide victory in multi-party elections the same year. He was defeated by APC candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma, in the 2007 Presidential election. Koroma cam- paigned on a ticket of change. > Mutilation It is difficult to meet someone who hasn\u2019t been directly affected by brutal war crimes. Horrific accounts of mutilation, with victims chosen at random, are still vivid. One young Freetown res- ident, \u2018Kenneth\u2019, describes how he was ordered to stand flat against a wall with his hands tied whilst rebels argued about whether to sever his limbs. He was freed, but many others were mul- tilated, including women and children. Another young man \u2018Kanu\u2019 recounts how his sister dis- appeared for three months in the bush where young women were stolen to cook and clean for rebels. Rape was common. Many child solders were killed. For victims with missing arms and legs, it is now doubly hard to find employment in a country where 65 per cent young men 18-40 have no employment. A Special Court established post-war by the United Nations, at the request of the Sierra Leonean government, still sits but is due to wind up during 2010, explains Francesca Varlese, project manager at the EU Delegation in Freetown. The EU has been giving financial backing to the Court since 2003, providing services such as a live video feed to listen to the ongoing trial of Charles Taylor from the Hague and internships so the Court\u2019s legacy will continue. Opinion is however divided over the Court\u2019s effectiveness, says Ambrose James who is Country Director of the NGO, \u2018Search for Common Ground\u2019, which produces videos and radio broadcasts to voice the views of all Sierra Leoneans. He says Sierra Leoneans have mixed feelings about the Court. Firstly, the \u2018big rebel leaders\u2019 like Sam Bokari, \u2018Mosquito\u2019, and oth- ers either died or fled. Then there is also confusion about why some members of the Civil Defence Force are before the Court. After all, they opposed the rebels. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t realise that they carried out some human rights abuses, so this is where there are complications,\u201d says Ambrose James in his Freetown office. He added that there are also questions about the functions of the Special Report Sierra Leone B y the 16th century, English sailors referred to the country as \u2018Sierra Leoa\u2019. During the late 1700s, Bunce Island, close to Freetown, became one of the major slave trading operations along the West African coast. It was in 1782 that British philanthropists founded the \u2018Province of Freetown\u2019, resettling some of London\u2019s black poor in Sierra Leone in the \u2018The Province of Freedom\u2019. Thousands of freed enslaved Africans were returned to Freetown. They settled from all over Africa and came to be known as the \u2018Krio\u2019 people. The Krio language is spoken widely amongst the country\u2019s 15 ethnic groups today. In 1808, Sierra Leone became an official British crown colony and the seat of government for its other West African colonies along the coast. The establishment of one of the first higher education colleges in West Africa in 1827, Fourah Bay College, excelled in medicine, law and edu- cation and led to Freetown being known as the \u2018Athens of Africa\u2019. > One-party state Sir Milton Margai, leader of the Sierra Leone People\u2019s Party (SLPP), was appointed the country\u2019s Chief Minister in 1953. Sierra Leone won its independence from the British in 1961 and Margai became its first Prime Minister. Siaka Stevens, candidate of the All People\u2019s Congress (APC), won the elections of March 1967, but was ousted after just a few hours, only to be returned to power in 1968. In 1971, the country became a republic with Stevens, then Prime Minister, appointed as Executive President. In 1978, a new constitution proclaimed Sierra Leone as a one- party state with the APC as the sole legal party. Major Joseph Saidu Momoh became President on Stevens\u2019s retirement in 1985 following a one-party referendum. President Momoh\u2019s constitutional review recommended re-establishing in 1991 a multi- party democratic constitution. By this time, suspicions of From PEACEBREAKING to peacemaking When Portuguese explorer Pedro da Cintra came across the mountains surrounding what is now the country\u2019s capital Freetown in 1462, he named the land \u2018Sierra Lyoa\u2019, meaning \u2018lion mountains\u2019. To his eyes, the jagged heights were shaped like a lion\u2019s teeth.

Very young children eek out a living on the streets selling bags of fruit or biscuits. Adult lit- eracy is just 30 per cent and 68 per cent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. > High expectations There\u2019s a lot of hope vested in the new govern- ment of Ernest Bai Koroma. He has pledged to govern in a \u201cbusiness\u201d style and faces a popu- larity test in the upcoming local elections in July 2008. There are other promising changes in govern- ment. An Anti-Corruption Commission created in 2000 is intent on stamping out corruption in all walks of life, explains Abdul Tejan-Cole, who has been at its helm since December 2007. He suggests radio jingles to encourage the pub- lic to become whistleblowers and wants parlia- mentarians to declare their assets. There is a lot to do to build the apparatus of government with the country currently depend- ent on budget support from major donors, which fill the gap in government revenue. The big four donors in Sierra Leone are the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), the EU, the African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank (WB). All meet regularly to discuss \u201cbench- marks\u201d for the disbursal of budget aid such as whether the government is managing its finances and meeting anti-poverty targets. Together, the four give \u20ac52M of budget sup- port annually, or 17 per cent of the Sierra Leone national budget. In 2007, fiduciary difficulties interrupted budget aid, which was largely due to unpredicted fuel price rises, explains Hans Allden, the EU\u2019s Head of Delegation in Sierra Leone. He stressed the delicate nature of budg- et aid; good financial management on the one hand and a predictable flow of budget aid on the other: \u201cIf not, all kinds of payment problems arise which even affect security. A group of hungry, unpaid people is not good for stability.\u201d The EU and DFID, which coordinate their aid strategy in Sierra Leone, currently provide 42 per cent of total donor funding to the country. Each concentrates on what it does best: the EU on infrastructure and governance, and DFID on education, health and sanitation. Other EU countries with bi-lateral aid programmes for Sierra Leone are Ireland, Germany, Italy and France. And according to Hans Allden the country would eventually like Sierra Leonean nation- als to train as peacekeepers themselves. This is, he says, \u201ca matter of immense pride for the country.\u201d D.P.

No single candidate won the 55 per cent of the vote needed for a win in the first round. Koroma has set out to apply his business skills to running a government. He is a former managing director of the Reliance Insurance Trust Corporation, a fellow of the West African Insurance Institute, Associate of the UK\u2019s Institute of Risk Management and a member of the UK\u2019s Institute of Directors in the UK. Koroma\u2019s All Peoples\u2019 Congress (APC) party holds a majority of 59 seats in Parliament following the August 2007 elections. He has signed \u2018contracts\u2019 with his Ministers to ensure the delivery of results, he told us in an interview in State House, Freetown at the end of February 2008. You were brought in as a ticket of change. What changes have you made so far? I have put in place a mechanism that will lay the basis for a turnaround where we will see the country begin to move again and have investors come in. We have brought about a peaceful transition from the past gov- ernment to this government. We have also addressed the issue that we believe should be primary in our objective, that is, providing energy for this country. Freetown now has a certain amount of electricity. We solicited the partic- ipation of the World Bank and other donors and put into action an Independent Power Production programme (IPP) where generating power was given to the private sector with the National Power Authority (NPA) doing the sales.We inherited six megawatts of power generation and added 15 megawatts. That has given us a situation of 21\u201322 megawatts and we have requisitioned an independent power generator adding an extra ten megawatts. What\u2019s next is to find a medium-term solution which lies in the comple- tion of Bumbuna hydroelectric station. The donor community has given us the US$45M required to finish the project this year. As for our com- mitment to having electricity throughout the country, we have to embark on a rural electrification programme. As we speak, the Chinese are exam- ining our hydroelectric potential. There is a possibility of having mini hydro-projects all over if we can successfully harness the five rivers that flow across the country. Which sectors will alleviate poverty? For any country coming out of war you have to address the humanitarian and social stabilisation issues. You must also address issues of the amputees and the displaced. Now is the time for us to go into real econom- ic growth and to create an impact on the economy. In addition to mining there is tourism, fisheries and agriculture. About 60-70 per cent of our people are engaged in agriculture.We have the potential of not just feeding ourselves but also exporting our agri- cultural produce.

Most of the APC\u2019s supporters are found in the north and west amongst Temnes who also make up 30 per cent of the population. The SLPPwon 43 seats at the last parliamentary elections in August 2007. It maintains its candi- date won the 8 September 2007 presidential run-off elections: \u201cFrom all indications, we won the elections. For reasons best known to the Electoral Commission, we were robbed of that victory. Four hundred and seventy-seven stations in our strong- hold were cancelled and never read,\u201d the party\u2019s National Administrative Secretary, Brima Koroma, told us in his Freetown office in February.* His declaration is in spite of both the Parliamentary and Presidential elections being declared \u201cfree and fair\u201d by a multitude of international election observers present, including those from the EU. Former SLPP President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, was in power for 11 years prior to stepping down before the 2007 elections: \u201cOur first pri- ority as a party was that people give us a man- date to return to peace. This was our pledge. Having said that, we won the election in 1996 and had to run the country from exile 1996- 1997. We set our target to end war, which was delivered,\u201d said Koroma. He went on to add that the SLPP government successfully reconstructed the country when war officially ended in 2000: \u201cIt took a whole lot of our time to repair damage and devastation in the provinces. There were no hospitals or schools. Benchmarks were achieved. In 2002, the economy of the country was stable, even the leone [currency] compared to the dollar.\u201d He said the SLPP government reintroduced local councils in 2004. Things now are \u201cunimagin- ably difficult,\u201d Koroma said, singling out the high cost of rice. > A third power The Peoples\u2019 Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC) holds 10 parliamentary seats and four ministerial posts \u2013 in return for back- ing the APC in the September presidential run- off, explained its secretary general, lawyer Ansu Lansana. His party gives Sierra Leoneans a third choice: \u201cThe two have been playing polit- ical ping-pong for quite a long time so our peo- ple have been clamouring for a third force.\u201d PMDC supporters are largely \u201c\u2026disaffected, unemployed and abandoned Sierra Leoneans,\u201d Lansana told us. He said the 11 years of former SLPP rule were characterised by gross inefficiency: \u201cA leader- ship that was also too preoccupied with old pol- itics where your grandfather and father were born SLPP, so you must be SLPP. This kind of approach to politics is detrimental to national development because it does not encourage governance by performance.\u201d And his opinion of the new government: \u201cThe only problem I have is that they have started reneging on some of their campaign promises. My perception of the country is one of guarded optimism. Because there are certain things that are positive and forward-looking but there are others that are still reminiscent of the past: job- lessness and disorderliness \u2026\u201d D.P.

You have said you want to run Sierra Leone like a business? We have to be more business-like. We have just come from a governmental retreat in Bumbuna and identified goals. We have made a promise that in the next 36 months we should start see- ing a turnaround. That\u2019s why I have initiated management contracts for ministers. They are now all talking with State House and agreeing on both their annual targets and those they should achieve over the next three years. How can you attract overseas investors? We are reviewing our laws, improving the inde- pendence and credibility of the judiciary and putting up a strong fight against corruption to ensure that people will be guaranteed fair play. This will bring in investors. We have about the best diamonds in the world, the largest deposits of rutile, huge deposits of iron ore, bauxite and platinum, etc. We also have huge potential in the agricultural sector. On top of this is our unique tourist potential. With the right invest- ment Sierra Leone can easily become the best tourist destination in the world. Our flora and fauna, topography and beaches are not found anywhere else. Sierra Leone is right at the bottom of UNDP index. How can you move up? We have just launched the 2008-2010 strategy plan for children and others. We are reviewing our education system and are working on improving on the number of people who have access to pipe-borne water as well as improving our medical facilities. When all of that is on course, I think the focus will be for us to moti- vate the people in charge of these services, those who deliver; doctors, nurses and teachers. Are you confident of repeated success in the July local elections? I believe that we will win most of the seats in the country because in a very short period the citizens have come to realize that we are a results-oriented government. We don\u2019t talk politics. What we say is what we do, as in the case with electricity. We will be launching our agricultural programme and want to ensure a health programme. You don\u2019t expect to see tangible results overnight. What you see is activity in govern- ment: an effort by us to work on the promises made to our people, and I think that people have trust in that. The only difficulty for us is that we have come in at a time when world market prices are increasing. The price of fuel is on the rise, as are the prices of rice and wheat. It is unfortunate that some of these have a direct impact on the life of the ordinary man. We can- not subsidise, as we do not have the funds. We are not an oil producing country. Is your government ethnically biased? This is not the case. We have people from the other regions; our ministers of Health and Marine Resources, for example. I have always insisted that it is a government of inclusion and we have people of every district represented, not only in governance but also at deputy min- ister level. We are appointing people to state- run companies and diplomatic missions, all of whom represent the national character. What is your view about the focus on budget aid in your partnership with the EU? It is important for it to continue, as our revenue base is very limited. We are asking for support to give us an opportunity to stand on our feet. When we kickstart the activities in mining, agriculture and tourism, I think we will have enough to run our budget and take care of our development endeavours. The EU is also play- ing a lead role in infrastructure programmes. Just like energy, an improved road network will facilitate economic activities in the country. It will create free movement of people, help the movement of agricultural commodities and enhance tourism and trade with our neighbours, Guinea and Liberia. D.P.

He added: \u201cThe cabinet has empowered me set up a sub-committee to look at all the agreements of the big mining companies, and in the process we will inject that into the new agreements between us and the mining companies.\u201d \u201cThe worst thing we have discovered is that people come here and get a mining explo- ration licence which they take to the stock market and raise money on our heads. They say it\u2019s legal but we want to change this,\u201d continued Jallon. Alfred Carew, executive secretary of the National Forum on Human Rights and chair of the National Advocacy Coalition on Extraction, told us that he believes Internet companies are doing the same thing. He\u2019s worried about the social costs of mining, such as the employment of child stonecrackers, prostitution, disease in mining areas and the envi- ronmental fallout. The Minister spoke about the current \u2018free-for-all\u2019 in the diamond district of Kono and related smuggling: \u201cWe try our best to organise it in a struc- tured way. In most cases you have a dealer who helps the landowner and workers get machinery. You then have to sell to this man because he\u2019s the one who helped you. This man will give the diamonds to an exporter who has a licence and is the only one with the authority to export.To get the licence you have to pay US $40,000. We believe that smuggling takes place in between this but we can\u2019t prove it.\u201d He said that the country subscribes to the Kimberley Process, which pro- hibits sale of diamonds from the world\u2019s conflict zones: \u201cI sign a Kimberley certificate for anybody who is exporting. But you have to go to the destination to get an end picture. Somebody has to be there however to check if the diamonds arrived. There\u2019s heavy administration involved.\u201d D.P.

A \u20ac 24M loan grant in part from \u2018SYSMIN\u2019, the EC\u2019s former fund to assist the mining sector with the remainder from the European Development Fund (EDF) has enabled Sierra Rutile Ltd. to start up again in the Bonthe District in the South-west. Rutile (titanium dioxide) is mainly exported to Europe, North America, Brazil, Japan and Russia where it is used in paint pigment, with the higher grades going to manufacture welding rods. The grant for the re-start was passed on to the government, which then channelled the monies in the form of a commercial loan to the company. Bob Lloyd, the company\u2019s managing director describes it as: \u201ca significant milestone in the re-birth of Sierra Leone at the end of the conflict.\u201d With projected production this year of 180,000 tonnes, the company is already on target to beat last year\u2019s 140,000-tonne figure. The extraction process leaves large bodies of water. These can be used for other productive purposes, explained Jean-Pierre Milard, who is an EU-funded technical assistant to the Ministry. And since the process is not toxic, there are many possible ventures. Bob Lloyd explained that Sierra Rutile Ltd. has set up a foundation which is currently funding a pilot agriculture reclamation on one of the \u2018lakes\u2019. Others include aquaculture and the pristine white sand left beached by mining is trig- gering thoughts of tourism. It seems the company has many more years in business. Bob Lloyd showed The Courier a map pinpointing the reserves found around Bonthe. And exploration is also ongoing along the coastline. The capital and interest on the loan amounting to \u20ac 45M are to be repaid to the government of Sierra Leone 2008\u20132013, starting with an initial \u20ac 716,000 in June this year. The EC is expected to have a say in how these monies are used. Bob Lloyd said that relations with the local population were good; officials meet regularly with the eight para- mount chiefs of the chiefdoms surrounding the mine.

We have big deposits of bauxite and iron ore. We have diamonds scattered all over the country and we are mining the source rock for diamonds, kimberlite and gold,\u201d explained Alhaji Abubakar Jallon, Minister of Mineral Resources, former Executive Director of the National Diamond Company and former geophysicist. With registered diamond exports worth US$125.3M in 2006, the gem is the country\u2019s number one export without counting its unregistered trade. Altogether the mining sector provides a livelihood for 250,000 people or 14 per cent of the labour force, but the government feels that mining could bring in more for Sierra Leoneans. The past fiscal regime has not attracted a large number of quality investments, say World Bank officials. Other drawbacks are a lack of transparency in granting mineral rights, large numbers of unlicensed, informal artisanal miners, as well as smuggling of gold and diamonds and the environmental and social impacts on local communities. According to World Bank figures, just 2 per cent of fiscal revenues came from the sector in 2000. AWorld Bank technical assistance project (US$6M via the International Development Association) is expected to be approved in July 2008 to look at ways of making the industry more transparent in the current regime, increasing mining revenues for the government and improving governance sup- port for Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI)* , which the country committed to in 2006. This will back up steps to regulate the sec- tor so far including the 2003 Core Mineral Policy and collection of geodata. Minister Jallon wants companies to do more to build up infrastructure around mines: \u201cIf you are mining somewhere, give us an electrical plant that will serve both you and the people of the area. Arecent mining forum held in Conakry, Guinea, sponsored by the World Bank and African Development Bank (ADB), reached the consensus that we should link mining with infrastructure.\u201d And there should be no repeat of the old type of agreement, the Minister told us. One example is Delcros , an iron mining company that when oper- ating for 20 years built a railway and port to export. When the mine closed, the port and railway were redundant: \u201cThis is the sort of situation that should not occur anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are going to allow anyone now to develop the mine \u2013 because a lot of people are coming to see us and there are other deposits like more than 100 million tonnes of bauxite as well as the remnants of the iron ore \u2013 we are encouraging them to form a consortium between those who want to GOVERNMENT DIGS DEEP to reform mining GOVERNMENT DIGS DEEP to reform mining A sub-committee to look at all the agreements Report Sierra Leone Dredger, Sierra Rutile Ltd. 2008. \u00a9 Debra Percival Minister of Mineral Resources, Alhaji Abubakar Jallon 2008. \u00a9 Debra Percival ",

It was followed by a \u20ac24M Link Relief, Rehabilitation & Development (LLRD) project providing tools and seeds, water and sanitation explained Georges Dehoux, of the Food Security Officer at the EU Delegation in Sierra Leone. He said that in a fertile country like Sierra Leone, \u201cfood security should not be a problem.\u201d Other food security projects have followed. With a \u20ac4.2M grant from the former EC\u2019s Stabilisation of Export Receipt Funding (STA- BEX) which offsets losses on agricultural export receipts, value is being added to cash crops in Bombali and Tonkolili (rice) and Kono, Kenema and Kailahun (cocoa). Matthias Reusing, Head of Rural Development at the EU Delegation in Sierra Leone, explained that the country cannot compete with the bulk cocoa exports of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana, but working with the Dutch NGO, AGRO ECO, has improved drying methods and certified the cocoa as fair trade and organic. Sold at US$1,000 per tonne pre- dried, it can now fetch upwards of US$1,400\u2013 $1,600 per tonne. Reusing suggested that it would be a good time for the country to hone in on the shortage of organic Robusta coffee in the global market. In the EU there is plenty of good Arabica coffee on the market grown at high altitude in Ethiopia, but not of Robusta, which is grown at a lower level. As Europeans like a blend of Arabica and Robusta, this could be an upco- ming niche. To keep up the momentum of the STABEX pro- ject, a \u20ac12M sum has been set aside under the 10th EDF to improve production, processing and marketing of cash crops, also including state actors again. And \u20ac4M from the 10th EDF will go to decentralisation of the sector building the capacity of district councils and non-state actors. Georges Dehoux emphasi- sed the need to act at a local level to move forward. D.P.

The study explores the different options for a fisheries partnership with the EU. Some 8,000 artisanal vessels such as dug-out canoes and planked vessels and 52 ocean- going trawlers, mainly South-east Asian and Spanish and Greek boats cur- rently have joint ventures to fish in Sierra Leone\u2019s waters. Chinese vessels are allegedly fishing illegally in Sierra Leonean waters, say observers. \u201cEverything close to shore is critical,\u201d said Reusing. One of the four options explored by the consortium is for EU vessels to fish tuna, deep water shrimp and small pelagic with such an agreement potentially bringing in royalties of \u20ac 2.5M a year. Since there is currently an EU ban on Sierra Leone\u2019s fish exports \u2013 which could be lifted this year \u2013 catches under the joint ventures must be enter- ing the EU through a third country, suggested Freetown observers. The EU has just launched a \u20ac 3M Institutional Support for Fisheries Management (ISFM) to assess stocks and provide technical advice for the conservation of resources working with the Institute of Marine Biology and Oceonography of Sierra Leone. The idea is to establish the current status quo of stocks and develop a sustainable management plan, said Reusing. In future the EU wants to continue to improve hygiene standards in the industry and do more to control and survey fishing in seven West African states, including Sierra Leone, to stamp out illegal fishing.

Renewable natural resources such as agro- forestry, agri- culture and fisheries add up to 50 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) with 75 per cent gaining their livelihood from the sector. The country is heavily reliant on imports for its staples like rice. When we visited at the end of February 2008, the high price of a standard bag of rice caused tempers to flare on the streets of Freetown. It was then around 80,000 leones (approximately $27US), whereas a bag cost 50,000 leones (US$17)* during the elec- tion season in August 2007. The international food crisis was mainly to blame for the price hike, explained President Koroma in Kenema, rather than the new government, and had led to a ban on rice exports in some areas. But he added that the crisis had put the spotlight on the country\u2019s reliance on imports and need to up home pro- duction. The government is to set up a produce development agency to look at the whole far- ming sector and strengthen production. Agriculture Minister, Dr Sam Sesay, told The Courier in his Freetown office he was also worried about rice easily getting through the country\u2019s porous borders: \u201cWe only fulfil 60 per cent of our rice requirement domestically. We have traditionally been rice producers and were in fact exporters in the 1960s. Of concern to the government is that a lot of our rice is interestingly going to neighbouring countries like Liberia and Guinea. Studies have shown that Sierra Leone has a comparative advantage of rice production both in the domestic market and to compete internationally.\u201d He sees a future too in other crops like chili pepper, cashews and ginger beer: \u201cThe pro- blem is it [ginger beer] is not properly made.

The mining company has also come under scathing attacks by a coalition of civil society groups and NGOs who continue to see the activities of the company as not only environmentally unfriendly, but contest that no measures have been put in place by Koidu Holdings to repair damages done to the envi- ronment after the mining operations. Koidu Holdings is not the alone in this regard. On the other hand, in the fight against environ- mental degradation the government of Sierra Leone and its development partners will need to address local individual activities like cutting of trees for charcoal burning, unorganised \u2018free- for-all\u2019 illegal mining in diamondiferous areas and timber logging. Paradoxically, all these activities are also a major means of livelihood and survival for a number of people across almost all walks of life. An extensive investigation by one of the leading national newspapers, Awoko , published a detai- led account of youths on a mining rampage in the eastern Kono District. There were graphic pictures showcasing a depleted earth as miners dug under bridges and houses in desperation. More than 100,000 youths are merely searching the soil for their daily bread. This is how they see it. Another newspaper, For Di People , publi- shed a researched article naming names of senior politicians who tacitly aid and abet foreign companies in their clandestine logging activities notwithstanding the government ban. At local level, the allegation of \u2018conspiracy\u2019 extends to both local and traditional leaders.

It will be a focal point for all environmental policy reviews, legis- lation and data and incorporate envi- ronmental issues into main policy-mak- ing areas such as mining, fisheries, water, sanitation and decentralisation. As part of the Gola Forest Programme, the country is also looking at carbon trading. One possibility is Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. This is aimed at setting up Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits to developing nations to cut back emissions. Sierra Leone is not cur- rently a Kyoto signatory, but might look at voluntary carbon markets which sell activities that reduce greenhouse gases to companies or individuals who want to reduce their carbon footprints, explains Reusing. Sierra Leone is also included in a study of DG Development due to be launched in Spring 2008 on legal and illegal cross-border trade of timber and forest products in West Africa.

T he hall was colourfully decorated with garlands of EU Member States\u2019 flags criss-crossing the roof of the British Council in Freetown. It is 10 December 2007 and the four month-old presidency of Ernest Bai Koroma is about to launch the Gola Forest Programme. The proj- ect will protect the 75,000 hectares of tropical forest host to rare mammals like the pygmy hippopotamus, chimpanzee, forest elephant and up to 14 globally threatened bird species including the strange white-necked Picathartes and the Rufous Fishing-owl. When fewer than 40 per cent of invited public officials turned up at the event, President Ernest Bai Koroma had no alternative but to express great disappointment and admonished his fellow countrymen of the \u201clooming global threat\u201d to the country\u2019s natural habitation. A \u20ac3M EU grant over five years was recent- ly earmarked for the Gola Forest Programme through the UK-based Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It will start up protected area management, capacity build- ing on all levels, livelihood programmes and community engagement in forest manage- ment planning, research and biodiversity assessment and environmental education and advocacy. The target is to protect the Gola Forest reserves for biodiversity conservation and community development, creating a new model of sustainable natural resource man- agement in Sierra Leone. It will be im plemented jointly with partners \u2013 the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone and the National Commission for Environment and Forestry (NACEF). The RSPB is itself soliciting donor support for a \u20ac10M endow- ment fund to generate annual interest pay- ments to run the Gola conservation project in the future. > Gola set to become National Park President Ernest Koroma was thrilled. He linked environmental importance to peace, stability and sustainable development. He also pledged his commitment to a transfor- mation of the Gola Forest into a national park in the future. Koroma ended with a call to the nation to recognise the devastating impact of environmental hazards. But the challenges facing the new All Peoples Congress (APC) government in the area of environmental protection is pile-high.Years of civil war in the sub-region saw mass migra- tions into virgin settlements which are still a heavy burden on biodiversity and flora and fauna. With little knowledge and experience in handling refugee situations, scant attention was paid to the environmental consequences of these migrations by governments, NGOs or United Nations (UN) agencies which were responsible for the establishment of so many new settlements for people running away from danger. This was aggravated by the merciless plunder of the natural resources and the ravage of biodiversity during the war period. Democratic order and rule of law have trig- gered governments of the region to attempt to control and regulate activities like logging, mining and hunting, among others, by imple- menting \u2018bans\u2019 on some of these activities. Logging and the exportation of timber for instance, have been banned by President Koroma\u2019s government. A law to combat land degradation through a National Action Plan has been drafted by the government of Sierra Leone in collaboration with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The programme aims to identify the symptoms, causes and effects of land degradation at both local and national levels. Recently the govern- ment also suspended the activities of the kim- berlite mining company Koidu Holdings after a violent confrontation with community youths left two people dead.

The govern- ment knows that by nurturing such natural assets it can pull tourists back to the country (see environment article). Sierra Leone\u2019s Tourism Minister, Hindolo Tyre, who has a small office tucked into the national sports stadium, says the sector will not be sidelined: \u201cThere has always been a tourism ministry but it has always been looked upon as the forgotten ministry. In fact, there was a joke that when a minister does something wrong he is usually pun- ished by being sent to tourism. For me, it\u2019s not a punishment it\u2019s a challenge. People can\u2019t count on mining forever.\u201d It\u2019s only a six hour flight from Europe but there\u2019s a lot to tackle to turn around the external perception of the country. On sandy beach terms, the country can compete with Gambia and Senegal with hidden bays like Sussex and River no.2, as well as the long stretch at Lumley. It\u2019s a different case with infrastructure. Flights to Sierra Leone are comparatively high-cost and the position of the national airport at Lungi on a peninsula means an extra unique helicopter hop into Freetown on arrival. At the time of writing there was no alternative sea transport to the capital. > Clean-up day . Other things that put off some tourists: visi- ble destitution, a largely cash economy and environmental problems such as waste \u2013 mainly plastics \u2013 washed up on Lumley beach. The last Saturday of every month has been declared environmental \u2018clean-up day\u2019 by the government when there\u2019s no traffic on the streets and you are expected to stay at home to tidy your area. \u201cThe sector can become a major foreign exchange earner and an employment genera- tor. To say that we are war torn is not right. What we need is to market and promote our country outside as well as inside,\u201d said the Minister. For starters, the Minister wants to print a map pinpointing the country\u2019s beauty spots, historical sites and relics. He talks about some spots: Bumbuna\u2019s amazing scenery and very nice guest rooms and Tiwai Island, a stunning nature reserve. Old colonial houses with ornate verandas give a bygone time feel to Freetown. And the cotton tree \u2013 an immense tree found growing in the late 18th century by former American slaves who won their freedom by fighting for the British in the American Civil War and named their new settlement Freetown \u2013 is a focal point in the capital. \u201cPart of our strategic plan involves having legal consultants even just for short periods of three months to look at rules and regula- tions; for example, the Tourism Development Master Plan in 1982. The Monuments and Relics Act was as far back as 1957. Even some of our agreements with hotels are not pro-Sierra Leone,\u201d said Minister Tyre. He said external investment was vital since domestic priorities are electricity, food and water: \u201cWhen you look at the country it\u2019s like a virgin untouched by investment and investors, but the approach we want to use is totally different. One of the failures of the system before is political interference. We want to de-politicise as much as possible.\u201d D.P. (cid:2) Website: www.sierraleone.org Is TOURISM a STIRRING LION?

Outside the focal sectors, funds are earmarked for agriculture (\u20ac12M \u2013 see article on agriculture); trade, which includes funding to underpin an eventual European Partnership Agreement (\u20ac3M); a technical and cooperation facility (\u20ac2.5M); and contribution to regional projects (\u20ac2M). An additional \u20ac26.4M \u2013 initially for two years but renewable \u2013 is contained within a \u2018B\u2019 envelope. This covers unforeseen needs such as emergency assistance, a contribution to internationally agreed debt relief and adverse effects of instability in export earnings. EDF monies to Sierra Leone have increased since 1975 when the 4th EDF was on stream. War interrupted planning, so \u20ac100M from pre- vious funds is still being spent. Between 1999 and 2002 the EC\u2019s humanitarian aid office, ECHO, pledged \u20ac44M for war victims, returnees and Liberian refugees. Sierra Leone is one of only a handful of ACP countries where the EU is jointly planning its aid strategy with an EU Member State, the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID). \u201cThere is huge complementarity between DFID, which concentrates on health and sanitation, and the EU with its focus on transport and infrastruc- ture,\u201d Richard Hogg, head of DFID\u2019s office in Sierra Leone, told us. Both donors also provide budget support. Under the 10th EDF, \u20ac15M has been pledged per year, amounting to 29 per cent of the total budget support by donors, or 5 per cent of total government rev- enue. Benchmarks for disbursal of these monies are drawn up with the AFDB, World Bank, DFID and include good public financial management. Of the \u20ac95M going to infrastructure under the 10th EDF, \u20ac48M is for feeder roads, \u20ac15M for overlaying the Songo-Moyamba junction road and \u20ac7M for construction of the Magbele bridge. Currently being upgraded with EDF funds are a 86 km stretch from Rogbere junction in Sierra Leone to Guinea and the 168 km from Masiaka to Bo. Continuation of this road to Liberia is seen as a funding priority since it would create a trade-enhancing artery from Liberia to Guinea. Also included in the budget chapter for infrastructure are funds for the vital energy sector (\u20ac12M), a \u2018master plan\u2019 for Freetown (\u20ac8M) \u2013 including development of urban roads and markets \u2013 and the devel- opment of river transport (\u20ac2M) including the building of jetties at points on the 380 km of inland waterways. There is a support for the Ministry of Transport (\u20ac3M). Out of \u20ac37M earmarked for good governance, explained Francesca Varlese, Project Manager at the EU Delegation in Freetown, \u20ac8M will go toward continued election support, including \u20ac3.7M for the holding of the July local elections and to election bodies \u2013 the National Electoral Commission and Political Parties Registration Commission. Chiara Bellini of the Delegation\u2019s governance section adds that reform of the civil service (\u20ac10M), and decentralisation of services (\u20ac9M) are also priorities. Additionally, there is continued funding for the National Authorising Office which coordinates EU projects for the government (\u20ac5M), sums for environmental gover- nance (\u20ac4M) and the building up of civil society (\u20ac1M).

The country then became a province of Byzantium and remained so for nine centuries, despite successive Arab raids. This period infused Cyprus very markedly with the culture of this Eastern Roman Empire. The Cypriot Orthodox Church became autocephalous at the end of the 5th century, thus appointing its own head. Richard 1st (the Lionheart) seized the island at the end of the 12th century, ceding it to the Knights Templar whose regressive and dictato- rial reign was followed by Venetian domination in 1489 and Ottoman occupation in 1570. This lasted until 1878 when Cyprus, which was still in theory part of the Ottoman Empire, was ceded to British administration in exchange for protection against the Russian threat. > One of the 20th century\u2019s tragedies In 1914, as a reprisal measure for Turkey aligning with Germany, Great Britain annexed Cyprus. The country officially became a British colony in 1925. The annexation was relatively well accepted as supporters of the first enosis (union with Greece), who made up the majority of the population and saw it as a timely opportunity. Disappointment was to follow and uprisings which were quickly quelled. After the Second World War, there was no recompense for the Greek Cypriots who had enlisted in large numbers (60,000) alongside the British troops. In 1955, they embarked on an armed struggle. Thanks to US intervention, in 1959 the Greek and Turkish leaders reached an agreement on the terms of independence for Cyprus that ruled out any union with Greece and any par- titioning of the country. A right of veto was granted to the Turkish Cypriot minority (about 20 per cent of the population) on a number of sensitive issues, as well as a guaranteed 30 per cent representation in the civil service. A final agreement was reached between the two par- ties and Great Britain. The agreement inter alia permitted Great Britain to retain its mili- tary bases on the island, which became inde- pendent on 16 August 1960. Its first president was Archbishop Makarios, one of the great non-aligned leaders of the Third World. > Partition The most determined members of the two communities were dissatisfied with the inde- pendence agreements and successive clashes prompted the UN Security Council to send a peacekeeping force to the island in 1964. The island\u2019s partition had already begun when Turkish Cypriot ministers were resigning from the government and fellow members of their community were increasingly moving to the north of the island. The military junta that had seized power in Greece in 1967 helped fuel a coup against President Makarios. In response to this and in the absence of any reaction from the third power guaranteeing the independence, i.e. Great Britain, Turkey seized the occasion to send in its army on 20 July 1974. It was soon to occupy 35 per cent of the terri- tory, representing what was the most econom- ically developed part of Cyprus at the time, with an economic potential estimated to be 70 per cent. A line of demarcation was traced that ran right through the city of Nicosia. Today this remains the world\u2019s only divided capital. About 140,000 Greek Cypriots, a quarter of the island\u2019s population, were forced to aban- don their homes and flee to the south. About 1,500 also disappeared. Only a few hundred Greek Cypriots and Maronites remained in the north. > Hope reborn It took the population of the Republic of Cyprus just 20 years to rebuild their economy and regain past splendours, to such a degree that Cyprus was able to meet the criteria for EU membership. For the European bodies, this accession implied prior reunification of the island in accordance with the UN\u2019s Annan Plan that was to be adopted by a referendum held simultaneously in both parts of the island. Whereas it won 65 per cent of the votes in the \u2018occupied\u2019 part of the island, it was rejected by 76 per cent of the Greek Cypriots, thereby clos- ing the door on Europe for northern Cyprus. This was a rude awakening for the European institutions and caused resentment among the Turkish Cypriots. However, the reality was much more complex. Despite the intent it did not seem that the Greek Cypriots were seeking revenge but simply regarded the Annan Plan as unbalanced with too many constraints for them and too many prerogatives for the Turkish Cypriots, if not for Turkey itself. The election as president of Dimitris Christofias, the AKEL (Communist Party of Cyprus) candidate on 24 February this year, shows clearly that the Greek Cypriots had no desire to prolong the disagreement. The amended corrections to the Annan Plan requested by Christofias earned him the sup- port of the principal election loser, former President Papadopoulos. He had been elimi- nated in the first round despite his economic and social successes, a fact which seemed to reflect that his uncompromising opposition to the Annan Plan was not widely supported. Dialogue resumed immediately following the election of Dimitris Christofias who entered into negotiations with Mehmet Ali Talat, President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (a state not recognised by the interna- tional community). The first symbol of these thawed relations was the opening of a Ledra Street crossing point in the demarcation line. Ledra was the original name of Cyprus. H.G . (cid:2) Discovering Europe Cyprus 45 T he history of Cyprus goes back a long way, with traces of human settlement discovered on the island as early as the 9th Millennium BC. Six thousand years later, people had developed now mastering the techniques of copper wor- king. Cyprus in fact lent its Latin name ( cuprum ) to this metal. But the real foundations of Cyprus were laid with the arrival in around 1200 BC of the Mycenaean Greeks who brought their language, cul- ture and skills. Greek culture was to continue to dominate the island, albeit with ups and downs. Quickly developing into a centre of Greek culture, Cyprus mixed the heritage of the motherland with inputs from many other cultures, all of them still present today in this melting pot of a country. Another major contribution came with the arrival of the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC, after being driven from their land (present-day Lebanon) by the Assyrians. This period brought a new flourishing of culture notably thruogh excellence in creating ceramics and fine jewellery, appreciated on Cyprus to this day. A succession of conquerors fol- lowed, with the Assyrians in the 8th century BC and the Egyptians in the 6th. The Persians arrived in 525 BC and held the land in an iron grip. This lasted until the victory of Alexander the Great in 333 BC, marking the official entry of Cyprus into its Hellenic era, which con- It is probably its long history as a place where cultures meet and mix that gave the people of Cyprus their dynamism and charm, including a touching hospi- tality, but above all an eagerness to strike up a conversation, rare in a coun- try suffering under partial occupation. The most recent political developments perhaps herald an end to this tragedy. CYPRUS and MALTA CYPRUS a meeting and mixing of cultures In this issue, The Courier highlights excep- tionally two European Union countries \u2013 Cyprus and Malta \u2013 to mark their entry into the eurozone. On 1 January this year both adopted the euro. Malta and Cyprus also have a lot in com- mon, starting with their small but open, flourishing and sound economies that enabled them to quickly fulfil the EU\u2019s convergence criteria, notably relating to growth, inflation rates and the govern- ment debt. The two countries joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on 2 May 2005. On 16 May 2007, the European Commission and European Central Bank gave them the green light to join the eurozone, a decision formalised at the 11 July Council. Both countries had a strong and stable currency at the time, the Cypriot pound ( \u20ac 1 = CYP0.5853) and the Maltese lira ( \u20ac 1 = MTL0.4293). Cyprus and Malta are also old European countries, lying on the fringes of the con- tinent and with a long history of being permeable to the territories and culture of Africa and the Orient.

The occupation caused 40 per cent of the population to take to the roads, residing in makeshift shelters. The economy was in free- fall. Yet in less than 15 years Cyprus was a nation rebuilt. Marios Tsiakkis, Director of Industry Department at the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says this \u2018Cypriot miracle\u2019 is due to a determination by all sec- tions of the population. He speaks emotionally of how the trade unions spontaneously appealed for a cut in wages as their contribu- tion to the reconstruction effort. By 1990, the feat was achieved. Today, consid- ers Mr. Tsiakkis, Cyprus is facing another challenge: that of competitiveness \u2013 on the one hand from Europe and on the other from China and other Asian countries. Agriculture current- ly accounts for 3.5 per cent of the economy, manufacturing industries 10 per cent and serv- ices 74 per cent. \u201cWe must evolve further towards a knowledge-based industrial econo- my with high added values. We are encourag- ing Cypriot companies to invest in research and development projects and innovation. The Chamber of Commerce is working with the Public University of Cyprus. It has set itself the task of acting as a catalyst between the uni- versity and enterprise.\u201d Of the 74 per cent share of the economy repre- sented by services, tourism accounts for 20 per cent. Other important branches are financial services, shipping, the booming construction industry, and the accounting and audit services used by many major international companies. At 10 per cent, the low level of corporate tax is a big investment draw. What\u2019s more, Cyprus has sealed agreements with about 40 countries around the world to avoid double taxation. Last but not least, wages in Cyprus are lower than in most EU countries (about 84 per cent of the EU average). The quality of the roads and communication systems, the common- place use of English, the advanced education and health systems, and a good social environ- ment combine to secure the country\u2019s excel- lent reputation among foreign investors. And don\u2019t forget, insists Tsiakkis, the security, an agreeable climate and the beauty of Cyprus. Cyprus\u2019s attraction for foreign investors and residents was very evident in the property boom. This explains why, within business cir- cles that generally favour reunification, mem- bers of the construction sector are especially supportive. They are already looking ahead to the billions of euros that would flow into the Economic MIRACLE One of the surprising things about Cyprus is its high level of economic development. Everything is new. Nicosia is sparkling. Its shopping and business districts can rival in size and luxury those of the world\u2019s richest cities. Jewellers, luxury boutiques, banks and the offices of major companies are everywhere. In the southern section of Nicosia, that is. Although not without its charms, the north of the city that lies in the occupied zone has a feel of abandon. E mmanuela Lambrianides, Senior Coordination Officer, Planning Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs* > Initial phase: Sub-contracting project implementation In 2007, the percentage of the GDP of Cyprus allocated to development policy reached 0.12 per cent. The target is for 0.17 per cent by 2010 in line with commit- ments made in the EU Council. Our strategy is to delegate imple- mentation of our cooperation to other EU Member States. This is not only because we don\u2019t have enough local experts but also for efficiency \u2013 why spend a lot of money on building up a big administration to deliver assis- tance when we can use what\u2019s already there. Our main partners are Lesotho and Mali among the ACP countries and four countries in our vicinity in North Africa and the Middle East.** Smaller amounts of aid go to ten other recipients. > Second phase: CyprusAid start-up Our sectors of concentration are health and education. We have comparative advantages in these areas and want to use our skills. We have set up custom-made courses on agriculture \u2013 short- term courses of around six weeks covering research. After the first phase we can man- age things ourselves, but we also work through NGOs. We are presently working with them to pre-empt what we can do on our own after 2010 at the closure of the medium-term strategy (2007\u20132010). We also have to set up the decision-making mecha- nism to establish \u2018CyprusAid\u2019, fostering closer links with the beneficiary countries and devel- oping links with our NGOs. We are also working on shipping and banking where we have received requests for short-term training. Another area is econom- ic planning. We have some expe- rience in this as the economy of Cyprus was itself completely dis- mantled. Cyprus had to take many planning initiatives and the role of the Bureau was instrumental. It created a five-year plan and instructed the private sector. We brought about a complete recov- ery of the economy after just 15 years \u2013 a fact the Planning Bureau is proud of. G eorges Virides, Director of D e v e l o p m e n t a l Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid, Ministry of Foreign Affairs* > ACP beneficiaries There are three projects we have been involved with. One is in Lesotho where a boarding house was constructed for girls in the district of Mokhotlong. The girls residing in the nearby area had had to travel a distance of eight kilometres each day on foot to go to school, facing the danger of being attacked by people with firearms. This project was under- taken in partnership with Irish Aid and the implementing agency was the Ministry of Education of Lesotho on the basis of an agree- ment between Ireland and Lesotho. The total cost of the project was \u20ac 350,000. In Mali we have completed a proj- ect on sustainable waste manage- ment in the town of Sikasso in partnership with the government of Belgium and Mali. The imple- menting agency was Belgian Technical Cooperation. The town of Sikasso faced major public health problems with increasing production of all sorts of waste, mainly industrial. The total con- tribution was \u20ac 151,000 and equipment was delivered at the end of 2006. Now we are in the process of another project with the govern- ment of Mali. This time we will construct four small bridges which will provide access to vil- lages in case people are cut off when there is rain. H.G .

THE PLANNING BUREAU architect of the economic miracle at the service of development To set up its development policy, Cyprus has mobilised both its development depart- ment in its Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Planning Bureau of the government whose task was to reconstruct the country\u2019s economy in the wake of the Turkish invasion of the island. north of the country in the wake of reunifica- tion.

        "How would you attract someone to Nicosia? If we\u2019re talking about doing business, Cyprus has always been a centre of services and used to be a business centre, even prior to accession to the EU. We have a flourishing offshore industry. Now, following EU membership, we have the lowest corporate taxes in the EU so many peo- ple from both within and outside the EU want to set up business here. The majority of busi- ness activities take place here, in Nicosia. Nicosia is little known to many people. Nicosia is the English version of Lefkosia , meaning \u2018white city\u2019. Lefko means white. Bel also means white in the Slavic language so Belgrade also means \u2018white city\u2019. Why Lefkosia? Because of the bright weather and white colours that dominate the buildings. But it is not only the weather that is good all year round. There are historical monuments. It is very easy to travel around Cyprus as it is small. The history of Cyprus dates back to the Stone Age. You can see settlements of the Stone Age people, as well as historic monu- ments that show the evolution of civilisation in the Middle East \u2013 the Phoenicians, Egyptians and Babylonians. This makes the country quite interesting from an archaeological viewpoint and Nicosia has a very interesting museum for anybody that wants to know more about how history has evolved, not only for Cyprus, but also for the whole of the region. Even though there\u2019s a Christian majority, there are many Muslim citizens and we have mosques and churches side-by-side. The sur- rounding medieval walls were built by the Italians when Cyprus was occupied by the Venetians and these are illuminated during the night. You can also come across British archi- tecture here, dating back to their rule of the island. Not a lot of people know that the Shakespeare classic, Othello, was set in Cyprus. Its hero got married in Famugusta. For visitors, there are beautiful landscapes sur- round Nicosia. Very close by there are high mountains. Even in this Mediterranean cli- mate, the mountains are covered by snow for a period of five to six months. If you travel just 45 minutes from here, you will find yourself in a snow-covered landscape with more than half a metre of snow. How much did Nicosia suffer from the divi- sion? The most peculiar and sad thing about Nicosia is the division of the city itself. As you know, in 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus and took half of the land. This occupation line goes right through the heart of Nicosia and splits it in two. Nicosia is the only divided city in the world. In Jerusalem there are sectors, but there are no walls as there are here. You feel it strongly here. If you go through the streets, especially in the built-up old town, you will always be coming up against a wall. You see empty streets that are very different to the lively streets a few metres away. As a City Council, we try to give incentives to people living close to the division line to relo- cate to houses that have been deserted. This is to lessen the problems arising from desertion in the area close to the line. The municipality compulsorily acquires deserted houses and gives compensation to the owners. We then first invite the previous owners to come and live there at a very favourable rent. If they decline, the houses are rented to others who are interested. We currently cannot meet demand with the houses that have been re- done. Some eligibility criteria apply for ten- ants, who are usually families with a moderate income. How did the Turkish invasion change the soul of the city ? The Turkish invasion forced many people into leaving their houses in the north. After 1974, the character of the outskirts of Nicosia changed with many new buildings. Some of them are not of the best quality. The city has expanded. We have made much effort to demolish part of the walls to have freer acces- sibility but the Turkish invasion army insists on being here, proclaiming they have protec- tive rights over the Turkish Cypriots to keep military quarters in the heart of Nicosia. Our dream as a local authority is to see the city reunited. H.G .

There are vertical and hori- zontal definitions. There are religions: Christian and Muslim. And then there are nationalities: Turkish and Greek. The British asked people to define themselves. Some of the so-called Turkish Cypriots were black Africans, others probably Turkmen rebels brought here who adopted the Muslim religion. In this country you can introduce yourself as Turkish, Turkish Cypriot, Cypriot, Greek, and Greek Cypriot. The way you define yourself is linked to your political perspective on the future. As a Greek person, you might be perceived as right wing. If you say Cypriot, you probably lean towards the left. Greek Cypriot or Turkish Cypriot means in the middle. But how much Cypriot and how much Greek or Turkish do you actually mean? Cypriot identity also means being committed to a geographical project of unity, or not. As an island, Cyprus has no other boarder than the sea. And all Cypriots like the shape of the country. Its form is copied in lapel pins and jewels. We keep the place where we lived in our memory but a lot of us were forced to forget this memory. Identity is always expecting something. I am a poet. Some poets are looking for hybridity and consider that Cypriot is a hybridity. In lan- guages, you find the same music. Words are even sometimes shared. You will find Italian words in all of our languages and similarly in the mind and character. We have the same memory. The way of thinking is quite similar. The family structure is quite similar, and the way people talk, the excitement. In the villages, you have to help each other to survive. For example, on Turkish religious days, you used to give an animal to a Greek Cypriot to take care of and vice versa. All this came to an end with the conflict over nationality... > Giorgos Moleskis P OET , MALE , G REEK C YPRIOT * There are so many identities in Cyprus. There are several religions: Greek orthodox, Muslim, Maronite, Armenian Christian and Roman Catholic. Linguistically speaking, all Christians were assimilated into the Greek language. The Roman Catholics are linked to the Maronites from Lebanon. The Maronites use the Greek language but they have also kept their Maronite dialect which is spoken in some Cypriot villages. This lan- guage is mixed with Greek words, as well as with Turkish and Arabic. My wife is Armenian, from Yerevan. The Armenians have a publication in Armenian and English. From 1996, each citizen has had to specify his or her religion. The perception of a Greek Cypriot or a Turkish Cypriot is not impor- tant. If you use a language, you use a culture. Greek culture for one and Turkish culture for the other. But everyone is part of the story. Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots lived for centuries in the same village. One shepherd looked after their flocks. They shared everything, the land and the shepherd. As a student I remember visiting parents of a friend of mine. Greeks and Turkish were together sharing everything: land, cattle, playing in the same neighbourhood. The folk music, the folk dancing, the food were the same. The same friendship, the same hospitality, the way they cultivated their land. Everything was the same. A part of identity is language, culture and tradition. But another part is everyday life. H.G .

        "50 N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 Nicosia is home to a rich patrimony, such as the unique Museum of Byzantine Art. Many cultural associations and foundations, such as the Symphony Orchestra Foundation, popu- larise the culture. The northern part of Nicosia also has much to offer. Of particular note is the cathedral of Ste. Sophie transformed into a mosque. Theatres, concert halls, cinemas and festivals covering all fields of international art and culture combine to make the island a treas- ure for art-lovers and tourists alike. H.G . (cid:2) Discovering Europe Cyprus Discovering Europe Cyprus 51 T wo and a half million tourists visit Cyprus every year. It\u2019s an island that seems to have something for everyone. Some are attracted by the silence and serenity of the archaeological sites, others by the beautiful beaches or snow-covered sum- mits. There are wonderful museums and other cultural attractions for art-lovers and places of fun and entertainment for partygoers. With never more than an hour\u2019s drive between the two, the island also offers a taste of exoticism, having mixed its Greek heritage with so many Oriental and even African influences. All the prestigious archaeological sites are in fact Roman and not Greek, its painting is Byzantine and its craftwork Venetian. Cyprus is in fact truly Cypriot, which is its greatest quality. Christina Mita, a professional tourist guide, sums up her coun- try as follows: \u201cThe dance, music, and dialect are different to Greece. The Greek influence prevents Cyprus from being Oriental and the very present Orient prevents it from being 100 per cent Greek.\u201d Since Nicosia airport closed following the occupation, the charming town of Larnaca on the southeast coast has become the country\u2019s main place of entry. It has the charm of a bygone age, in particular the old Turkish quarter offering romantic and picturesque walks along the seashore at dusk. The churches and chapels of some of the region\u2019s vil- lages \u2013 Pyrga and Kiti for example \u2013 bear superb testimony to the pas- sage of the kings of France. North of Larnaca lies the formerly thriving town of Famagusta. Only a small part of its southern suburbs is under the control of the Republic of Cyprus. Today it is the sleeping beauty, emptied of all its inhabitants, retained as a possible bargaining chip for a hypothetical recognition of the North by the Republic of Cyprus. On the south coast lies Limassol, an important beach resort with its thronging crowds and nightclubs. But just outside it is the serenity of the archaeological site of the Greco-Roman city of Kourion, long cov- eted by Egypt (Ramses III) and which was first to become Assyrian and then Persian. Its theatre, with the sea as a backdrop, hosts a major arts festival, and experts are continuing to unearth whole sections of the Roman city. Between Limassol and Paphos on the coast further to the west, almost at the entrance to this most fashionable of Cypriot towns, imagination takes hold at Petra tou Romiou where Aphrodite, the goddess of love, emerged from the foam ( aphros ) of the sea. If you have any doubt about the reality of the myth, you can still see the rock that reproduces her profile and that emerged from the waves at the same time as Aphrodite herself. Further to the north, and inland, is another world. Find the calm of the monasteries in the high mountains of the Troodos which are also a destination for skiers. > The checkpoints as places of culture With its archaeological sites and monasteries, the past is present every- where on Cyprus. This is especially so in the capital, Nicosia, known as Lefkosia in Greece and as Lefkofla in Turkish. Nicosia is probably the most relaxed divided city in history. Even as you approach the demarca- tion line, there is no air of tension, just a moving symbol. On the demar- cation line between the checkpoint for the Republic of Cyprus and for Northern Cyprus, the UNFICYP forces are based in the Ledra Palace. Once or twice a week the Bi-communal Choir rehearses there. Made up of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, each member has to pass through the checkpoint to attend choir practice. The two choirmasters, one from each community, speak mainly in English. The choir, created in April 2003 as soon as the first crossing point was opened, gives concerts in the north and south of the island. The songs are drawn from both communities, sometimes the same song is sung in the two languages, such as Niksarin Fidanlari , an old Turkish melody also adopted by the Greeks. Lenia Melanidou and Costis Kyranides, the two choirmasters, recounted the long history of their choir, the only bi-community association to have lasted so long, despite the trials and tribulations.

        "52 N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 Charles V at the time. The latter firstly appealed to the Knights of the Order of the Hospital of St. John in Jerusalem to block the Muslim offensive in Malta and finally ceded the island to them in 1530. At first the Knights of the Order had little interest in settling on this arid land, its declining population consist- ing now of little more than the old nobility of Mdina who were decendants of the Normans of Sicily. After losing Tripoli, the Order won the battle of Malta against the Turks in 1565. With this victory the Christians had completed their recapture of the European Mediterranean. At this time a new capital city was built \u2013 Valletta, a fortification town whose construc- tion began in 1566. During this time, naval battles flared between the Turks and the gal- leys of the Order. The knights eventually transformed Malta into a huge European naval school that supplied sailors to France. This was to transform Malta into a massive European naval school providing sailors to France who in 1765 made the island its protec- torate. The Order found itself stripped of all its assets by 1792 having backed the French King Louis XIV against the revolution of 1789. In response, the Order elected a German knight as its head. Then in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte and his fleet of 300 ships conquered Malta without a shot being fired. Bonaparte seized the Order\u2019s treasury and continued on to Egypt, but the garrison he left behind incurred the wrath of the population due to its harass- ment of the island\u2019s churchmen. Finally the French garrison capitulated, assieged by the British in 1800. No longer wanting the govern- ment of the Grand Master, in 1882 the Maltese asked to come under British rule, requesting nothing other than the guarantee that they could retain their constitution and Roman Catholic religion. The agreement between Malta and Great Britain was ratified by the Treaty of Paris in 1814. After a difficult period \u2013 mainly due to succes- sive outbreaks of plague and cholera \u2013 Malta entered a period of relative prosperity during the second half of the century due to its coal ports and geographic location close to the newly constructed Suez Canal. In particular it would be shaken by a language dispute between the partisans of Italian and English, fuelled by the first stirrings of a desire for national independence. Initially calmed by a number of concessions, demands for autono- my resurfaced in the climate of economic recession at the end of the First World War. The British Administration reacted to this with a series of policy changes - one of these con- cessions was to give recognition of Maltese as the official language of the island from 1934. The Second World War strengthened the bonds between the British and Maltese and to resist invasion attempts by the Germans, the fortress island was transformed into a defensive bunker. Everything was converted into a shel- ter against attack, including the Neolithic caves and the catacombs. At the outbreak of war, Malta (less than 250 km 2 for the main island, and just over 300 km 2 when Gozo and Comino are included) was subjected to around 2,500 air raids in just two years resulting in the destruction of 40,000 homes and 2,000 deaths. The summer of 1942 saw 154 days (and nights) of continual bombardment on Malta (compared to 56 on London). 6,500 tonnes of bombs fell on Valetta harbour alone (compared to 260 tonnes dropped on Coventry). The country was decorated with the George Cross for its heroism. At independence, the Maltese included this symbol of courage as part of their flag. Malta, the heroic, was granted self-govern- ment in 1947. However, the Nationalist Party, unlike its Liberal rival, was not satisfied and when it came to power in 1962, its leader \u2013 Gorg Borg Olivier \u2013 immediately demanded full independence. This finally became a real- ity on September 21, 1964. After being elected to power in 1974, the Labour Party pushed through a republican constitution in the same year and the closure of the British military base on the island. This government, headed by Dom Mintoff, was also notable for adopting a Third World stance and a position of neutrality in the face of the two major world power blocs. The Nationalist Party was returned to power in 1984, this time led by Eddie Fenech Adami, who served as prime minister until 1996. During this period, the long-banned Order of Malta was once again recognised. Moreover, Adami\u2019s economic policy marked a break with the socialist tendencies of his predecessor, while remaining loyal to the pledge of neutral- ity on international issues. In 1992, Adami opened negotiations with Brussels with a view to Malta joining the European Union. However, the introduction of VAT cost him the 1996 elections. Labour was then returned to power, led by Alfred Santz. This government lasted just two years following the outcry sur- rounding its decision to freeze negotiations on EU membership. When the Nationalists won the 1998 elections, Eddie Fenech Adami reopened the EU acces- sion process in 2000, culminating in member- ship for Malta on 1 January 2004. The Nationalist Party went on to win the subse- quent elections the most recent on 8 March 2008. H .G. (cid:2) Discovering Europe Malta 53 T he very first inhabitants most pro- bably arrived during the 7th Millennium BC and immigrants arrived from Sicily during the 5th Millennium. The megalithic temples and hypogeums bear testimony to the most ancient of cultures including the remarkable under- ground temple at Hal Saflieni, recognised as a world heritage site \u2013 were built between the 4th and 3rd Millennia BC. It was the Phoenicians and the Carthaginians who next left their indelible mark on the island\u2019s culture - from 700 to 218 AD, the year Malta became part of the Roman Empire. By this time, the Carthaginians had already developed shipbuil- ding there. > Early conversion to Christianity At the dawn of the Christian era, in the year 60, a ship carrying the future St. Paul (who was on his way to Rome where he was to be put on trial) ran aground on the island, the event becoming a key moment in the country\u2019s history - its conversion to Christianity and its Latinisation. After Rome, the Byzantine administration took office in 395 AD until the invasion by the Aghlabids in 870 AD. The latter remained for two centuries, at a time when the Arabs also ruled in Sicily, Gibraltar and Spain. > From the Arab world to the Sicilian Vespers Malta was steeped in the history of two cen- turies of Arab occupation. North African Arabic was to form the basis of the Maltese language. The Arabs were followed by a suc- cession of conquerors for most of the next five centuries. First were the Normans from Sicily who exploited the divisions between Muslim countries, many of which were also bogged down in war with the Byzantine Empire. In 1090 they absorbed Malta, but without driving out the Arabs. The island, by now home to Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities, became a stopping off point for pilgrims and crusaders. For four centuries Malta was to remain within Sicily\u2019s fold and subject to its vagaries. In 1130 Sicily became an autonomous kingdom, when it fell firstly under the authority of German King and Roman Emperor Frederic II (1194) and then under the French Emperor Charles of Anjou (1266). The French were driven out in 1282 by the Sicilian Vespers and Sicily pledged obedience to the Kingdom of Aragon, fully becoming part of the Crown of Aragon in 1409. From the beginning of the Sicilian period, Christianity was returned to Malta with the adoption of the Italian language by the nobility. Finally, in 1479, with its des- tiny still linked to Sicily, Malta came under the control of the Catholic Kings of Spain who allowed feudal fiefdoms to develop there that took part in piracy and smuggling. > The Order takes hold At the beginning of the 16th century, the Ottoman troops of Soliman the Magnificent conquered the Greek island of Rhodes, threat- ening Sicily that was part of the kingdom of Malta has known seven thousand years of integration rather than occupation, of adaptation rather than revolt or revolution. Malta has always been an inherent part of the empires that annexed it. Then in the early 19th century it joined the British Empire \u2013 this time at Malta\u2019s own request \u2013 before peacefully negotiating its independence in 1964.

        "54 Again he takes the example of St John\u2019s Cathedral and the sense of duality and ambi- guity. \u201cFrom the front, it looks like a garage. And the interior looks like a theatre. They always want to portray the image of the impor- tance of Malta.\u201d > Divisions and consensus On Malta, public opinion is always initially divided. For example, on EU membership, one of the two big parties, the Labour party was in favour of a partnership, but not full member- ship, while the Liberals advocated the latter. A referendum was held that produced a clear vote in favour of membership, which the socialists accepted. \u201cThat\u2019s Malta,\u201d says Friggieri, \u201cfirst it divides and then it comes together. But the national consensus is strong.\u201d A dividing line runs through this large island, with the more lib- eral North and more conservative South. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree on everything but we need the com- ing together to survive. And when the next chal- lenge comes along, we divide again and then come together again. Always a boxing session, then peace and then boxing again,\u201d he says. But this ambiguity reflects a profound truth, that of the wholeness of Malta: \u201cVery small but complete, like a small insect with a whole organism, not half a nation.\u201d The coun- try\u2019s political vision is like the Maltese soul. \u201cThere is a sense of attachment to the inner circle, to the parish, to the party. Who are you? Where are you from? Sect, cast, regions, social groups, these are all important in Malta. So our psychology is older than we are,\u201d he con- tinues. The Maltese have defined their identity in terms of land and sea. A map of the country shows a small island surrounded by forts. They are always thinking of a possible invad- er, with a fear of being attacked. Says Friggeri: \u201cValletta is a fortress. The city can be locked. Wherever you are in Malta, you have those inside and those outside. Who are you? Where do you come from? The people of Malta har- bour the memory of being persecuted in Rhodes.\u201d About 100 years ago the divide was on lin- guistic issues. Should the language be Italian, the language of tradition, or English, the lan- guage of power? The question resurfaced, albeit with less passion force, at the time of independence. In the meantime there was the Second World War during which Malta lent considerable support to allied troops, and the recognition shown by England in awarding it the George Cross medal (the only time a place has received such an honour). English had nat- urally come to be established as the second official language, Maltese being, in addition, the national language. But feelings are still divided, smiles Friggieri, especially at a football match when Italy plays England: \u201cIt\u2019s deeper than just sport. It\u2019s older than that. It is something to do with the image of the father. Our identity precedes us. Islands mean tradition, identity, and resistance to change.\u201d Malta is thus very much an island but one that has absorbed a great deal from the large countries that surround it. It has adopted, compared, and modified a great many things to suit its needs. > Arabic language for a European people Maltese is without doubt a Semitic language and to be precise, has an Arabic structure. In fact, Malta has almost always been exposed to the arrival of populations from the North, yet paradoxically it is Africa and the Middle East that gave it its language, the basis of its architecture and so many other aspects of its culture. > Membership of the European Union Friggieri believes that Malta has a sense of security and self-sufficiency. Coupled with this is the search for the father as protector. \u201cSo, there is a government and there is Brussels which brings an international identi- ty.\u201d But, he adds, many feel that Brussels is very distant. \u201cWhy should I care about it?\u201d The local media speak very little about Europe except when giving practical information, the rate of the euro or major political events. \u201cMalta is an outer edge, a periphery to itself, on the edge of itself,\u201d he concludes.

His view is that, \u201cI don\u2019t write about Malta but about a human being.\u201d Friggieri has published a considerable number of books, poems, novels and essays that have been translated into many languages. All of his books explore this tiny island which is an obses- sesion, Malta and its multiculturalism. > Constant duality \u201cThe Malta I grew up in is completely different from the Malta of today,\u201d he explains. Today the island resembles a town. At the centre of the village there a church used to stand and opposite, a square (misra), then houses and beyond these, fields. The church at the centre was a symbol of power and culture. Huge churches, \u201cbecause we are small\u201d. Beyond that, there lay yet another village with the same design. And then it these villages fused together and interlocked. But inspite of everything, the nation retained its identity. Malta is a nation where everybody lives in close proximity to everybody else. The \u2018misra\u2019under- went a change. Nowadays, the capital, Valletta, is deserted after six in the evening. The centre is no longer there. Today, people prefer to go out in St Julians with its diverse entertainment and leisure facilities. The basis of the Maltese nation\u2019s culture is Christianity and language; within each of which there lies a duality. For example, that of the mag- nificence of St John\u2019s Cathedral in Valletta on the one hand and the small village churches on the other. An important characteristic of the country is that it has always been on the side of major powers. With Napoleon when he was at his strongest (between 1798 and 1800) and afterwards with the English, alongside Nelson and Alexander. \u201cMalta was always part of a big empire and now Malta is in the EU\u2026We tend to exaggerate: the biggest, the strongest, and the greatest,\u201d says Friggeri. Because it is small, Malta has always been a part of larger empires. It opens up to the world so as to better concentrate on its security. \u201cMalta is at the edge, a periphery to itself.\u201d Divided on everything, it somehow always manages to reach national consensus. That, at least, is the analysis of Oliver Friggieri*, professor of literature, poet and literary critic.

        "N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 Our Chamber is encouraging our enterprises to branch out over- seas. What we are saying is, if you can sell here to Maltese people and to tourists, why not in Casablanca and Prague? They have to do that. In the Chamber we have an expert to assist small and medium size business. Big concerns like Corinthia , are big enough to do it alone. > Smart City Our country is orienting itself towards IT. Smart City is akin to Dubai\u2019s Internet City . The gov- ernment has given the go ahead for it to be built here in the neigh- bourhood of Ricasoli. This project will create 5600 jobs for IT pro- grammers and others. Maltese people will work there. Development of the area started six months ago. Smart City will be finished in five or six years. We currently have one computer for six students. In six months time we will have one computer for four students, the highest rate in the world. All classes will have web classes. > Malta in the movies The film industry is another grow- ing area of the economy. Famous films have already been made in Malta: Gladiators , Troy , Munich and very soon, a big Spanish film whose title is still under wraps. . We also have cruise liner tourism. In the winter, 15 cruise ships dock every week. Some of them come in 12 months of the year. Even if they come for just one day, tourists spend money. The aver- age tourist stays six to seven days. When it\u2019s too cold in the North, pensioners from UK or Germany stay two, three weeks, sometimes five weeks or more. I am very optimistic about the economy. The Government can afford to lower taxes. Salaries are increasing and profits are increas- ing. The overall revenue from taxes has increased but the rates have decreased, from 35 per cent to 32 per cent. The Prime Minister has announced that the economy is strong enough to cut the top rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. And if you currently earn \u20ac 12,000 a year, you don\u2019t pay any income tax. Unemployment is currently 6 per cent which is very low. This has gone down over the last five years. The government deficit has decreased as well as the national debt. All these factors opened the way for Malta to join the Euro zone.We believe that our entry into the euro zone will allow our economy to prosper; GDP will grow and debt will go down. > Many jobs for foreigners Malta has very high numbers of migrant workers. As a small country, it is not always easy to find the right skill sets. Computer specialists, for exam- ple, usually come from Europe and especially the UK. The hotel industry attracts workers from Italy and France. Building indus- try workers come from African and Mediterranean.Without such workers, salaries would go up and companies would be less competitive. > Housing Malta has a housing problem because during the First and Second World Wars, a lot of hous- es were destroyed in air attacks. The government voted a law to make it very easy to rent a house if your building had been destroyed. This law has not changed since and is very favourabale for tenants. You, your children and even your childrens\u2019 children can stay in a house at the original rental price and the owner is responsible for all the mainte- nance. People still live in nice houses and pay just \u20ac 100 per month. The law changed in 1994, but only for new tenants, not for previous ones. If you are an owner, you often prefer to leave the house empty. The Chamber of Commerce is lobbying the Government for a change of this law but it is hesitating. It is afraid some people might not be able to pay more. All factors have to be carefully studied before the gov- ernment makes any move. (cid:2) Discovering Europe Malta Discovering Europe Malta 57 M alta gained its independence in 1964. From 1964-1979 it still had a lot of support from UK which had military bases on the island. From 1979, Malta became econo- mically self-sufficient. In the private sector, the government identified two up-and-coming sector; manufacturing and tourism. > Building a dynamic manufacturing industry The government created the Malta Development Cooperation whose role was to attract foreign investment. At that time, wages and the standard of living were low. Institutions such as the Chamber of Commerce were on the Board of MDC but it was the gov- ernment that took a prominent role. Companies interested in diverse sectors: cloth- ing, textile, spare parts for car, etc., came from the UK, Germany and the US. The government has also given incentives (subsidies, rent facilities, and other kinds of support) to encourage investment. In the tourism sector, the government subsided the building of hotels and resorts by investors and gave concessions of land and beaches. In the 70\u2019s, the government set up \u2018Air Malta\u2019 whose primary purpose was to promote tourism. Malta also relied on its people. We were hard working, spoke English, and could be trained by foreigners. By the late 90\u2019s, Malta\u2019s stan- dard of living had considerably increased. In the beginning, jobs were not created very quickly in the private sector, but by the public sector; police, land revenue, etc. There were many national monopolies at the time: elec- tricity, telephone, TV stations and Air Malta. They all belong to the government. Unemployment was never high in Malta. You either worked with the government or services or were self-employed. By the late 90\u2019s, we reached today\u2019s level and the standard of liv- ing and and salaries went up. At the same time competition for investment from Eastern Europe China surfaced. We were always pre- pared for this. In 2004, Malta joined the EU and was eligible for certain funding. With this aid, Malta was able to train its people, espe- cially in IT, and we were able to build infra- structure, roads, develop fibre-optics, establish internet connections and modernise the air- port. The economy has changed, becoming less dependant on manufacturing and more so on services. Some factories have uprooted to Tunisia and elsewhere but they still belong to the Maltese. Many marketing, design, research and devel- opment businesses remain in Malta. Tomato processing is amongst those that have moved to Tunisia. This used to be done in Gozo. As for the Maltese clothing industry, the tailoring is done in Tunisia and design, marketing and business negotiation in Malta. Malta is part of the globalised world even if Maltese people do not travel outide the coun- try very much. In the tourism sector, Corinthia (Corinthia Group of Companies) is a big busi- ness. It has a chain of hotels and is soon to open a big hotel in London. It has already launched in Gabon, Libya, Turkey, Portugal, Czech Republic, and Hungary. A smart economy with no fear of GLOBALISATION Based on interview with Kevin J. Borg, Director General of the Maltese Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise By Hegel Goutier Economic overview of Malta Boat people in Malta F or about the past five years, Malta has been confronted with the regular arrival of boat people from African countries who either land on its coastline or are intercepted by Maltese coast- guards. On average, 1,500 arrive every year, many having crossed the Sahara before embarking on a flimsy craft in Libya. They are all initially housed at the Hal Far Open closed centre that has about 600 people in residence at any one time. Located close to the inter- national airport, the camp consists of tents and offers minimal comfort at best, provoking protests from some NGOs. Following transfer to a second open centre, those who are granted asylum face the problem of a lack of work. Despite its prosperous economy, Malta has a population of just 400,000 and is only able to offer between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs a year to foreigners. Few, if any, of these jobs are accessible to boat people. They either lack the required skills or are simply rejected, say the local media, for the very fact of being boat people.

        "R arely do you have the opportunity to feast your eyes on such a beauti- ful book of photographs featuring the work of creative people from this part of Africa. Congo Eza is the excep- tion that proves the rule \u2013 although there have been others, like the special edition of Revue Noire in 2001 which extolled the virtues of art photography. Congo Eza brings together the contemporary reality of Congo, the recent war and the bustle of everyday life and the country\u2019s creativity. The book is a collection of emotions and snapshots. Black, white and in colour. Spontaneity, dramatic composition, insolence, revolt, transgression, light-heartedness and humour: 24 photographers from diverse back- grounds. They have one thing in common: participatation in one of two artistic events and training programmes organised by the Wallonia-Brussels Delegation in Kinshasa and the Foreign Relations section of the French Community of Belgium, amongst which \u2018Yambi\u2019, the 2007 Congolese Culture festival in Belgium. The Brussels-based AFRICALIA association decided to record the success of their get-togethers in this high- end publication. Linking the the different sections of the book are selected verbs in lingala which punctuate the various chapters. Kokekola , to learn, to bring up, to grow. The primarily black and white idealised images evoke people\u2019s desire to learn from books, in sports fields and from loved ones. Sadly, also through that most common of chil- dren\u2019s games \u2018playing at war\u2019, as singer and poet, Marie-Louise Bibish Mumbu\u2019s introduc- tion to this chapter explains. Her contribution is a marvellous piece of writing. It is beautifully written, as is all the poetry that accompanies this pictorial journey through the kaleidoscope of Congolese life, its hopes and dreams. Other verbs in Lingala: kobouger , a word for to move, to travel; kolingana , to love one another, to make love; kobeta libanga , to survive, to get by; komilakisa , to appear, to pose; kosambela , to pray; kokoma , to write, to mark,to paint. Finally, kopana bakambi , to choose, to vote, to elect, featured in epigraph with a tragic, yet amusing poem by the Congolese author, Fiston Nasser Mwanza.

It has beaches and entertainment, a flavour of the east, a Semitic language and unique collec- tions of art. The past, which is evident everyw- here, stands side-by-side with the present and promises for the future. These include the work of an architectural genius, Richard England, who is creating magic with the splen- did buildings of the knights of the order. With a total surface area of just three hundred square kilometres, including the adjacent islands of Gozo and Comino, the country\u2019s attractions can be visited within two or three days thanks to its excellent road and sea infra- structure. One way of visiting the island is to opt for the \u2018Red Tour\u2019 which takes a day for the south route and another for the north route. Sights to be seen on the south route include the fortifications of the three cities of Cottonera; inspiring Valetta with its shipyards; the bright fishing village of Marsaxlokk with its colour- ful boats lined up in the harbour; the beautiful beaches of Bugibba, Qawra and St. Paul\u2019s Bay with their entertainment areas and the crys- talline waters of the Blue Grotto. The north route features the botanical gardens of San Anton; the faded charm of the former capital, Mdina, \u201cthe silent city\u201d with its graceful mix- ture of medieval and baroque architecture and the twists and turns of its backstreets; the tall cliffs of Dingli near to the Buskett Gardens with its vineyards, orangery, olives and citrus fruit plantations and the luxurious, fashionable districts of Silema and St Julians. There are also many treasures within easy reach in the capital, Valetta. The Co-Cathedral of St John which houses Caravaggio\u2019s \u2018The Decapitation of St John\u2019 is one worth taking time out to visit; the Grandmaster\u2019s Palace and many other palaces as well as wonderful ter- raced gardens like those at Upper Baraka. > Satisfying the soul In Valetta, there is also the ancient fortress of St. James Cavalier, which has been trans- formed into a vibrant centre of culture and cre- ativity by the poet, architect and philosopher Richard England, who brings real soul to the imposing defences of the Knights of Malta, allowing light and dreams to enter into the depths of the military fortifications. His influences include the mantra of Axel Munthe: \u201cThe soul needs more room than the body.\u201d* Indeed, England dreams of giving the whole of Valetta some of the magic of his major works which include the Martin Luther King Memorial in Washington, the Itehak Rabin Memorial in Tel Aviv, and other major architectural projects in Moscow, Buenos Aires, Wroclaw as well as private homes, churches, theatres and sanctuaries. He would like to give the city \u201cthe silence in between\u201d, as he calls it. Something he has achieved in the main lecture hall and the humanities block of the University of Malta. When his \u2018Valetta master plan\u2019, is completed the whole personality of Valetta will be trans- formed. This is already seen in the work he has carried out at \u2018St James Cavalier\u2019 and the \u2018Central Bank of Malta\u2019, where \u2013 with almost surgical precision \u2013 he has created something new while being faithful to the existing struc- tures.

An actor, dressed in a police uniform, then sits inside the car and sings \u201cCan\u2019t Take my Eyes off of You\u201d through speakers mounted on the car\u2019s roof.

And if it\u2019s quite alright, I need you, baby!\u201d James Webb\u2019s The Black Passage is a narrow dark corridor in which the visitor walks toward the source of a rumbling sound \u2013 the descent into amine. At the end a light is the suggestion of a half-closed door, but when we arrive we find out that there is no way to go out. It is a shocking and surreal experience to go into the mine tunnel, but also evokes similar \u2018no way out\u2019, both physically and psychologically. Ismail Farouk\u2019s videos give us an interesting representation of life in South African cities. Photographs by Zanele Muholi shift the focus to discrimination and identity issues from the racial, gender and sexual perspectives. Night Journey by Colleen Alborough, an interac- tive installation: a labyrinth of veil curtains in which the spectator becomes an active part of the narrative and sensory path of the dreams and nightmares of a mysterious per- son sleeping. Also, the leather figures by Nandipha Mntambo move across the wall to elicit the past. These figures are linked both to the dis- ruptive and aggressive nature of South African animals and to the elegance of 18th century dresses. In sum, \u201cnew South African art\u201d is not exclu- sively related to apartheid anymore, though it retains strong political and social tones. The artists of .ZA perfectly illustrate the condition of intellectuals placed in a peripheral position within the new globalised world where \u2013 despite everything seeming to be near and pos- sible \u2013 peripheries remain peripheries. (cid:2) 60 Creativity Occhiello tion\u2019s creator Lorenzo Fusi has joined them. Considering the works presented, what is clear is that the selected artists do not run the risk of following African clich\u00e9s in order to be accepted or to sell abroad. This interesting corpus of works \u2013 though some slightly imma- ture \u2013 is juxtaposed with the venue, which is an amazing 15th century palace of with a suc- cession of rooms, halls and ceilings decorated with Renaissance-style paintings. The beauty of the rooms is capped by a turret which, besides offering the best 360-degree view of Siena, is the location where Galileo had his prison sentence commuted and was placed under house arrest after having relinquished the Catholic Church. Another important element is the iconographic material that the five artist-curators have pro- vided in order to enhance the exhibition\u2019s image: five dynamic, hard-hitting posters cov- ering both the walls and floor of the entrance room. This environment introduced the central performance by Johan Thom during the open- ing ceremony: for four hours, he endures having broken glass and yellow oil poured on top of him. The co-curators have also written the catalogue texts to illustrate the contemporary situation of South African artists. Kendell Geers\u2019analysis of the country\u2019s cultural systems is particularly poignant: \u201cSince the fall of apartheid South Africa has been struggling to come to terms with its violent history, struggling to find a bal- ance between building a future and addressing the imbalances of the past. [\u2026] Instead of art being celebrated for its excellence, the work of art has been reduced to a politically correct demographic with an emphasis on traditional craft.\u201d In essence this is an accusation against affirmative action policies that wanted to reverse relations between blacks and whites, and against which art was rebelling. However, for white artists and writers, bridg- ing the gap with their black counterparts often resulted in the loss of credibility and by being perceived to speak on behalf of oppressed black people. With the end of apartheid, the artists\u2019most serious problem has been the dis- appearance of a common \u201cenemy\u201d as well as the need to find a new purpose for their work. The young authors of .ZA , who grew up in Mandela and Mbeki\u2019s Rainbow Nation, seem to have positively solved this problem without negative feelings towards their former enemy. The exhibition comprises artwork about South African identities and places, and highlights the unsolved struggles of this multiethnic soci- ety, while dealing with more universal themes as well. In the performance-installation, Serenade by Simon Gush , a local police car is Sandra Federici YOUNG ART from South Africa \u201c I s it possible to speak of South Africa without falling into the traps of clich\u00e9 about race, apartheid, colonialism, class, poverty and AIDS?\u201d asks Kendell Geers in his text for the exhibition catalogue, .ZA - Young art from South Africa . This is the very challenge underscoring the exhibition produced by the Centre for Contemporary Art Palazzo delle Papesse in Siena. As stated by director Marco Pierini, this initiative started with the purpose of \u201cphotographing\u201d the country\u2019s young artistic production in collaboration with more mature artists (Marlene Dumas, Kendell Geers, Bernie Searle, Minnette V\u00e1ri, Sue Williamson), each of whom has been requested to choose three artists.

The programme, managed and implemented by the ACP Secretariat and a programme management unit, is funded under the 9th European Development Fund (EDF). The programme aims at reinforcing the capacities of policy decision- makers and cultural operators through an: \u2022 ACP Cultural Observatory to improve the policy, legal and institution- al frameworks of the cultural sector in ACP Member States; \u2022 Intra-ACP Support Fund for Culture to reinforce and professionalise ACP cultural operators; \u2022 ACP/ILO/UNCTAD/UNESCO-joint project to strengthen the creative industries in five countries (Fiji, Mozambique, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, and Zambia). \u201cThis programme\u201d is the culminating point of a process begun with the Dakar Declaration of ACP Ministers of Culture who in 2003 fixed objec- tives for the ACP cultural industries,\u201d says Aya Kasasa, programme responsible at the ACP Secretariat. \u201cThere was a great expectation between ACP operators, because information spread a lot through the ACP Cultural Festival, which was the first concrete result of Dakar Declaration.

        "63 or younger readers N. 5 N.E. \u2013 APRIL MAY 2008 62 A frican influences in Caribbean art are now widely acknowl- edged, but European influences were just as much in the blend that would breathe into the essence of the islands and their songs and dances, romanticism, sensual melancholy and broad aspirations. European music (especially that of Central and Eastern Europe) with its dances \u2013 waltzes, mazurkas, pas de deux \u2013 and romanticism - especial- ly that of Central and Eastern Europe - as embodied by Brahms and Chopin, became part of the Caribbean fusion. At the turn of the 18th century in Haiti, for example, the Polish \u2013 who often unwillingly accompanied Napoleon\u2019s troops \u2013 would be the first Europeans to give their support to the emerging nation. Their presence contributed to spreading the violin and melancholic music. The influence of the violin is also found in the folk music and dances of Dominica (merengue), Cuba (guaracha), and Guadeloupe and Martinique (the zouk). European heritage would become grounded in the roots of much of the music of Cuba as well as that of Haiti, Puerto Rico and Martinique. Among the burgeoning bourgeoisie, this classical music of Europe and its local composers came to be known as \u2018scholarly music\u2019(\u2018musique savante\u2019). In the first decade of the 19th century it would be taught at the Milo School of Music, founded by King Christophe, in northern Haiti and in the musical salons of Santo Domingo. Over time, this blend would become more exciting with distinctive features.You might say, more romantic, warmer, more mellow. Such are the danzas of the Cuban Ignacio Cervantes ( Duchas frias and three danzas) and Haitian Ludovic Lamothe ( Danses espagnoles no. 2 in A minor, no. 3 in F minor, D\u00e9claration ) and works by Frank Lass\u00e8gue ( Chanson du rivage no. 3) and Alain Cl\u00e9ri\u00e9 ( Pr\u00e9lude ) are in the second part of the concert by Michel Laurent, which opens with pieces by Brahms ( Waltzes, Opus 3 ) and Chopin ( Mazurkas, Opus, 6 no 1, Opus 67 nos. 2, 3 and 4 ). Michel Laurent\u2019s fluid, graceful and pas- sionate interpretation completely captures the sensuality of this famous repertoire. H.G.

Even if it did not bring joy, music was a respite from the harshness of life at that time.
