        "J. whereas the biological references and parameters forming part of the harvest rule should follow the most recent scientific advice and the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU in respect of modifications of certain biological references and parameters built into the harvest rule and in order to be able to react quickly to changes; 1. Underlines that the plan's objective is to maintain the biomass of western horse mackerel at a level that ensures its sustainable exploitation, and to provide the highest long-term yield; 2. Believes that the harvest control rule should be based in equal parts on precautionary advice and on recent total allowable catches, adjusted by a factor that reflects the recent trend in the stock abundance as measured through egg production; 3. Stresses that the harvest control rules are core elements of the multi-annual plans that must be decided under the ordinary legislative procedure; 4. Underlines that long-term management plans applying to as many fish stocks as possible are key for the conservation of fish stocks, as stressed by the Commission in its proposal for a reformed Common Fisheries Policy; 5. Stresses that the existing interinstitutional deadlock must be resolved for the benefit of a sustainable fish stock and to allow fishing operators better forward planning of their activities; 6. Urges the Commission to take more initiatives to foster a political dialogue between the three institutions aimed at clarifying their respective roles in the decision-making process and at addressing the issue of the future architecture of multi-annual management plans; 7. Urges the Commission to act swiftly, as indicated and promised on several occasions, in order to prevent other interinstitutional blockages in relation to future long-term management plans, 8. Urges the Council to submit its position on the proposed multi-annual plan for western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel in order to allow the Parliament to start its second reading and make progress on this matter; 9. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission for information. Contribution of the common fisheries policy to the production of public goods P7_TA(2012)0052 European Parliament resolution of 16 February 2012 on the contribution of the common fisheries policy to the production of public goods (2011/2899(RSP)) (2013/C 249 E/07) The European Parliament , \u2014 having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy ( 1 ), EN C 249 E/22 Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2013 ( 1 ) OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.

Thursday 16 February 2012 ",
        "G. whereas the European fisheries sector contributes to social development, by creating jobs directly and indirectly, and to economic growth in Europe, by providing 6.4 million tonnes of fish each year; H. whereas the multifunctionality of the fisheries sector is reflected in different areas, for example through the impact it has on socio-economic, historical, cultural, scientific and environmental issues; I. whereas fisheries activities have an impact mainly on coastal areas and islands, contributing to their effective management and to their social and economic dynamics; whereas this is particularly important for their communities, which are frequently disadvantaged as a result of the scarcity of jobs and the weakness of local economies; J. whereas the reformed CFP should be closely linked to other key EU initiatives in the area of maritime affairs, in particular those outlined in the Commission communication entitled \u2018An Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union\u2019 (COM(2007)0575), which states that the European fisheries sector can also trigger and enhance a vast array of scientific studies that deepen our knowledge of oceanographic dynamics, ecosystems and the biology of the aquatic species directly or indirectly involved in fisheries activity; K. whereas a dynamic, well-managed fisheries sector could make an increasing contribution to European society and the European economy and thus play a significant role in the Europe 2020 Strategy; 1. Emphasises that the fisheries sector is an important EU industry which provides EU citizens with high- quality food and creates economic and social added value for the European Union; takes the view, therefore, that the reformed CFP needs to guarantee the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources and the preservation of fish stocks at a healthy level, so that fishing activities can continue in their traditional areas and communities in the long term; 2. Considers that environmental, economic and social sustainability are important objectives of the CFP, and emphasises that the CFP\u2019s top priority should be the establishment of a sustainable fisheries sector in order to ensure that current and future generations continue to enjoy the environmental, social and economic benefits of fishing; 3. Emphasises that fisheries, if properly managed, could make a greater contribution to European society, in terms of food security, employment, and the maintenance of dynamic fishing communities, and in many other ways; stresses that the existence of healthy fish stocks, healthy marine ecosystems and the preservation of marine biodiversity are in themselves common goods which are only produced if fish stocks are managed in a sustainable way and any unnecessary negative impact on the environment is minimised; 4. Considers it crucial to recognise seas \u2013 which cover more than two-thirds of surface of our planet \u2013 as a resource which plays a crucial role in producing other natural resources (e.g. fisheries); also considers it strategically essential that the CFP should incorporate clear and precise measures in order to ensure that it can fulfil its strategic role through an eco-systemic approach; 5. Emphasises that the CFP contributes to the achievement of the targets of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy and of the EU\u2019s aim of halting biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 by adopting measures to secure sustainable fisheries, by taking precautionary measures to eliminate destructive fishing, by ensuring the recovery of over-exploited fish stocks and by taking measures to protect species not targeted by fisheries; 6. Recalls that, at an economic level, the fisheries sector (including aquaculture) is estimated to generate EUR 34,2 billion in annual earnings and that, at a social level, it creates more than 350 000 jobs, including upstream and downstream in the fishing, fish processing and marketing sectors, in particular in coastal areas, remote regions and islands; EN C 249 E/24 Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2013 Thursday 16 February 2012 ",
        "7. Stresses that the fisheries sector has a multifunctional dimension and, that beyond its three traditional areas of activity and its visible impact at an economic, environmental and social level, it also plays a relevant role in a number of other areas, such as the environment, culture, recreation and tourism, science, energy and education, and emphasises in particular the importance in this regard of the small-scale fisheries sector; 8. Calls on the Commission to take due account of the fact that the fisheries sector plays an important role in the following areas: (i) culture \u2013 by contributing to gastronomy, ethnography, history, literature, museology, etc. (ii) recreation and tourism \u2013 by offering many different activities, such as trips out to sea with local fishermen, whale and seabird watching, ecological diving, etc. (iii) science \u2013 by helping marine scientists, and others, in their research (iv) energy \u2013 by promoting the development of new technologies which may subsequently benefit society as a whole (v) the environment \u2013 by safeguarding bio-sensitive geographical areas, as well as coastal areas in which hatcheries and nurseries are located, and also in cleaning the seas (vi) education \u2013 by developing people\u2019s enjoyment of the outdoors and teaching respect for the sea; 9. Emphasises that, by virtue of its multifunctional dimension, the fisheries sector provides communities with common goods which benefit EU citizens in general, and not only those directly or indirectly involved in fisheries, a contribution which must be acknowledged and valued; notes, further, that considerable numbers of EU citizens, in particular those living in coastal areas, benefit from the multifunctionality of fisheries activities; considers that the multifunctionality of the fisheries sector should be fully taken into account in the financing of the CFP; stresses that the production of these additional public goods must not be used as an excuse to delay necessary reforms of the CFP; 10. Urges the Commission to assist small fishing ports which have been badly affected by a decline in landings as a result of overfishing; 11. Stresses that the fisheries sector (which covers both sustainable wild fisheries and aquaculture) is one of the most important pillars of food security in the European Union and that as such its sustainability and stability must be guaranteed by the CFP reform, so that, in the future, it can provide fisheries products of sufficient quality and in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand from more than half a billion EU citizens; 12. Emphasises the potential of sustainable marine and freshwater aquaculture to complement the role of fisheries in making an important contribution to food security in EU; stresses that a specific policy is needed to guarantee the environmental sustainability of the aquaculture sector; calls on the Commission to establish general qualitative criteria for aquaculture which should be met throughout the EU and which take into account the environmental and social impact of aquaculture; calls, further, on the Commission to ensure that imported aquaculture products have been produced in accordance with the relevant EU sustainability and quality standards, i.e. environmental or animal welfare standards; 13. Notes that recreational fishing was not tackled in the Commission proposals presented on 13 July 2011; stresses that it should be addressed separately as part of the CFP reform process; EN 30.8.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 249 E/25 Thursday 16 February 2012 ",
        "14. Emphasises that further diversification of activities directly or indirectly linked to fisheries could help to slow down the exodus of workers from the sector, keep regional customs and traditions alive, and halt the depopulation of some coastal areas; 15. Stresses that fisheries management is increasingly based on scientific data, which stimulates applied research in this area, promoting knowledge and fostering technological development and innovation, in line with the EU 2020 Strategy for promoting smart growth; 16. Stresses that the fisheries sector depends on the health of stocks and on the balance of the ecosystem, so that the CFP reform must shift the focus back to the sector\u2019s role as the guardian and manager of marine resources with a view to creating a more efficient, greener and more competitive economy, in line with the EU 2020 Strategy for promoting sustainable growth; 17. Stresses that fishing activities, when all their dimensions are considered, including sustainable aqua\u00ad culture, their direct and indirect impact and the common goods produced by means of fishing activities, guarantee social and territorial cohesion and promote vocational training and social and economic dynamism, in line with the EU 2020 Strategy for promoting inclusive growth; 18. Stresses that the fisheries sector, both on its own and through the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), must contribute to achieving the Rio+20 goals for an open economy, and also to creating jobs and eradicating poverty; 19. States that fishing activities play an important role in the wider context of the IMP and represent a key element in maritime spatial planning policies and in the framework of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund; 20. Asks the Commission to acknowledge the multifunctionality of the fisheries sector and the value of its production of a wide range of common goods; 21. Asks the Commission to ensure in its future policy proposals and decisions that the CFP contributes to overarching policy aims, such as the EU 2020 strategy; takes the view that this crucial process of CFP reform must recognise the CFP as a source of development in the context of the European Growth Project and create the conditions which enable it to develop its full potential; asks the Commission to take the specific characteristics of fisheries and coastal regions into account when developing and implementing these policies; 22. Asks the Commission to integrate the concept of \u2018conditionality\u2019, which is already employed in the common agricultural policy, into the reformed CFP in order to ensure positive discrimination for environ\u00ad mentally-friendly fishing practices, for example through better access to funds; 23. Asks the Commission, in order to promote the development of parallel activities, to find a legal solution which enables fishermen to develop other sources of income within the wide range of \u2018fishery- linked activities\u2019 without being financially penalised; 24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
