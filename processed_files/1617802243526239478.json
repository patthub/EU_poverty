        "IV (Notices) NOTICES FROM EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS, BODIES, OFFICES AND AGENCIES COUNCIL Council conclusions of 11 May 2010 on the social dimension of education and training (2010/C 135/02) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, HAVING REGARD TO: 1. The conclusions of the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 14 November 2006, meeting within the Council, on efficiency and equity in education and training ( 1 ), which invited Member States to ensure equitable education and training systems that are aimed at providing opportunities, access, treatment and outcomes that are independent of socio-economic back\u00ad ground and other factors which may lead to educational disadvantage. 2. The Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning ( 2 ), which highlights the importance of developing the provision of key competences for all and of making appropriate provision for those who due to educational disadvantages need particular support to fulfil their educational potential. 3.

        "8. The conclusions of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, of 21 November 2008 on preparing young people for the 21st century: an agenda for European co- operation on schools ( 8 ), which invited Member States to ensure access to high-quality educational opportunities and services, particularly for children and young people who may be disadvantaged by personal, social, cultural and/or economic circumstances. 9. The Council conclusions of 26 November 2009 on the education of children with a migrant background ( 9 ), which invited Member States to take appropriate measures at their required level of responsibility \u2014 local, regional or national \u2014 with a view to ensuring that all children are offered fair and equal opportunities, as well as the necessary support to develop their full potential, irrespective of background. 10. The Council Resolution of 27 November 2009 on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018) ( 10 ), which invited Member States to ensure equal access for young people to high-quality education and training at all levels, and to promote better links between formal education and non-formal learning. AND HAVING PARTICULAR REGARD TO: The Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) ( 11 ), which identified the promotion of equity, social cohesion and active citizenship as one of its four strategic objectives and which defined five reference levels of European average performance (European benchmarks) that also place a strong emphasis on achieving equity. AND IN THE LIGHT OF: The conference on \u2018Inclusive Education: a way to promote social cohesion\u2019 held in Madrid on 11 and 12 March 2010. NOTING THAT: Education and training systems across the EU need to ensure both equity and excellence. Improving educational attainment and providing key competences for all are crucial not only to economic growth and competitiveness, but also to reducing poverty and fostering social inclusion. Social inclusion through education and training should ensure equal opportunities for access to quality education, as well as equity in treatment, including by adapting provision to indi\u00ad viduals\u2019 needs. At the same time, it should ensure equal oppor\u00ad tunities to achieve the best outcomes, by seeking to provide the highest level of key competences for all. AWARE THAT: Education and training systems contribute significantly to fostering social cohesion, active citizenship and personal fulfilment in European societies. They have the potential to promote upward social mobility and to break the cycle of poverty, social disadvantage and exclusion. Their role could be further enhanced by adapting them to the diversity of citizens\u2019 backgrounds in terms of cultural richness, existing knowledge and competences, and learning needs. Education is neither the sole cause of, nor the sole solution to, social exclusion. Educational measures alone are unlikely to alleviate the impact of multiple disadvantages, and so multi- sectoral approaches are needed which can articulate such measures with wider social and economic policies. Increasing international competitiveness requires high profes\u00ad sional skills combined with an ability to create, innovate and work in multicultural and multilingual environments. Together with the demographic squeeze, this makes it even more important for education and training systems to raise overall attainment levels, whilst ensuring that all people, young and adult \u2014 regardless of their socio-economic background or personal circumstances \u2014 are enabled to develop their full potential through lifelong learning. In this respect, particular attention should be paid to the requirements of persons with special educational needs, those of persons with a migrant background and those of the Roma community. As the social effects of the economic crisis continue to unfold \u2014 and in the context of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010) ( 12 ) \u2014 it is clear that the downturn has hit hard the most disadvantaged, while at the same time jeopardising budgetary efforts which target these groups. EN 26.5.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 135/3 ( 8 ) OJ C 319, 13.12.2008, p. 20. ( 9 ) OJ C 301, 11.12.2009, p. 5. ( 10 ) OJ C 311, 19.12.2009, p. 1. ( 11 ) OJ C 119, 28.5.2009, p. 2. ( 12 ) See footnote 6. ",
        "RECOGNISES THAT: If Europe is to compete and prosper as a knowledge-based economy based on sustainable, high levels of employment and reinforced social cohesion \u2014 as envisaged in the Europe 2020 strategy, the role of education and training in a lifelong learning perspective is crucial. The provision of key competences for all on a lifelong learning basis will play a crucial role in improving citizens\u2019 employability, social inclusion and personal fulfilment. In the context of the European benchmarks agreed under the ET 2020 Strategic Framework for European cooperation in education and training, there is an urgent need to reduce the current number of low achievers in basic skills \u2014 particularly reading (for which current data indicate that an average of one in four pupils is unable to read and write properly) \u2014 and to further reduce the number of early leavers from education and training, as well as a need to increase participation in early childhood education and care, to raise the number of young people with a tertiary-level qualification, and to increase adult participation in lifelong learning. Such needs are particularly acute in the case of those from a disadvantaged background, who statistically tend to perform significantly less well against each of the benchmarks. Only by addressing the needs of those at risk of social exclusion can the objectives of the Strategic Framework be properly met. CONSIDERS THAT: Differences in the degree of social inclusion achieved by the Member States indicate that there remains significant scope to reduce inequalities and exclusion in the EU, both through structural changes and through additional support for learners at risk of social exclusion. Equity and excellence are not mutually exclusive but complementary, and should be pursued at both national and European level. While each Member State\u2019s situation is different, European cooperation can help identify ways to promote social inclusion and equity, while not compromising excellence. Systems which uphold high standards of quality for all and strengthen accountability, which foster personalised, inclusive approaches, which support early intervention and which target disadvantaged learners in particular, can be powerful drivers in fostering social inclusion. Student support schemes such as grants, loans and additional non-pecuniary benefits can play an important role in facilitating equal access, particularly in higher education. Given increased pressure on financial resources for education, it will be crucial to achieve enhanced effectiveness for public investment; analysis of the design and impact of different funding systems can help to inform choices. FURTHER CONSIDERS THAT: With regard to early and school education: 1. Participation in high-quality early childhood education and care, with highly skilled staff and adequate child-to-staff ratios, produces positive results for all children and has highest benefits for the most disadvantaged. Providing adequate incentives and support, adapting provision to needs and increasing accessibility can broaden the participation of children from disadvantaged back\u00ad grounds ( 13 ). 2. Ensuring high-quality education which provides key competences for all is one of the most effective ways of promoting social inclusion. Additional support is needed for schools with a high proportion of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. 3. The successful prevention of early school-leaving requires the development of knowledge about groups at risk of dropping out (e.g. due to personal or socio-economic circumstances, or due to learning difficulties) at local, regional and national level, and systems for identifying early individuals who are at such risk. Comprehensive, cross-sectoral strategies should be implemented, which provide a range of school-wide and systemic policies targeting the different factors leading to early school-leaving. Individualised support for pupils at risk can include the provision of personalised learning, coun\u00ad selling, mentorship and tutorship systems, welfare support and extracurricular activities in support of learning. 4. At the level of each education institution, strategies for inclusion require strong leadership, the systematic moni\u00ad toring of results and quality, innovative high-quality teaching supported by appropriate teacher training, empowerment and motivation, cooperation with other professionals and the provision of adequate resources. Providing more integrated support to learners in need requires cooperation with parents and stakeholders in the community, for instance in areas such as non-formal and informal learning activities outside school hours. EN C 135/4 Official Journal of the European Union 26.5.2010 ( 13 ) For the purposes of this text, the term \u2018disadvantaged background\u2019 also covers, as appropriate, learners with special educational needs. ",
        "5. Creating the conditions required for the successful inclusion of pupils with special needs in mainstream settings benefits all learners. Increasing the use of personalised approaches, including individualised learning plans and harnessing assessment to support the learning process, providing teachers with skills to manage and benefit from diversity, promoting the use of cooperative teaching and learning, and widening access and participation, are ways of increasing quality for all. With regard to vocational education and training (VET): \u2014 A diverse vocational offer, with a stronger emphasis on key competences, including transversal ones, can provide much needed routes for individuals to improve their qualifications and thus access the labour market. In the case of disad\u00ad vantaged groups, the relevance of VET can be increased by tailoring provision to individual needs, strengthening guidance and counselling, recognising different forms of prior learning, and promoting alternate schemes for learning at the workplace. Increasing participation, particularly that of the low-skilled, in continuing vocational education and training is key to an active inclusion approach and to limiting unemployment in cases of industrial change. With regard to higher education: 1. Raising aspirations and increasing access to higher education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds requires strengthening financial support schemes and other incentives, and improving their design. Affordable, accessible, adequate and portable student loans as well as means-tested grants can successfully increase participation rates for those who cannot afford the costs of higher education. 2. More flexible and diversified learning paths \u2014 for example recognising prior learning, part-time education, and distance learning \u2014 can help to reconcile higher education with work or family commitments and to encourage wider partici\u00ad pation. Implementing measures aimed at monitoring and increasing the retention rate in higher education, at providing individualised support, as well as at enhancing guidance, mentoring and skills training \u2014 particularly during the early stages of a university course \u2014 can improve graduation rates for disadvantaged learners. 3. Special efforts are needed, especially with regard to funding, to ensure that full account is taken of the needs of disad\u00ad vantaged students, who are often unable to benefit from the mobility schemes available. 4. The fight against inequality, poverty and social exclusion can be strengthened by recognising that higher education insti\u00ad tutions have a social responsibility in returning the benefits of knowledge to society, in putting knowledge at the service of the wider community \u2014 at both the local and the global level \u2014 and in responding to social needs. 5. Higher education institutions can also exercise social respon\u00ad sibility by making their resources available to adult and informal and non-formal learners, strengthening research on social exclusion, fostering innovation and updating educational resources and methodology. With regard to adult education: 1. Expanding access to adult education can create new possi\u00ad bilities for active inclusion and enhanced social participation, especially for the low-skilled, the unemployed, adults with special needs, the elderly, and migrants. With specific regard to the latter, learning the host country language or languages plays an important role in promoting social integration, as well as improving basic skills and employability. 2. Adult learning, offered in a variety of environments, involving multiple stakeholders (including public and private sectors, higher education institutions, local commu\u00ad nities and NGOs) and covering learning for personal, civic, social and employment-related purposes, is central to reaching disadvantaged and at risk groups. With specific regard to employment-related learning, businesses can demonstrate corporate social responsibility by better antici\u00ad pating structural changes and providing opportunities for retraining. 3. The potential of inter-generational learning can be explored as a means of sharing knowledge and expertise, and of encouraging communication and solidarity between younger and older generations, bridging the growing digital divide and reducing social isolation. Within a lifelong learning perspective: \u2014 Education and training systems with flexible pathways, which keep opportunities open as long as possible and which avoid \u2018dead ends\u2019, help to overcome disadvantage. They also help to avoid socio-economic or cultural mar- ginalisation and being held back by low expectations. Providing lifelong guidance and the validation of acquired skills, including the recognition of prior learning and EN 26.5.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 135/5 ",
        "experience, diversifying admission patterns for all levels of education and training, including higher education and adult learning, and devoting more attention to the quality and attractiveness of learning environments, can facilitate tran\u00ad sitions for learners. Innovative ways of delivering guidance and collaboration with other social services and civil society are needed to reach out to disadvantaged groups outside the education and training systems. ACCORDINGLY INVITES THE MEMBER STATES: With regard to early and school education, to: 1. Ensure wider access to high-quality early childhood education and care, in order to give all children \u2014 particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds or with special education needs \u2014 a sure start, as well as to increase the motivation to learn. 2. Improve the quality of provision in schools and reduce differences between them and within them, with a view to countering possible socio-economic or cultural marginalisation. 3. Focus on the acquisition of essential basic skills, especially literacy, numeracy and \u2014 notably in the case of pupils with a migrant background \u2014 language skills. 4. Encourage networking activities between schools, in order to share experience and examples of good practice. 5. Intensify efforts to prevent early school-leaving, based on the development of early warning systems identifying pupils at risk; encourage school-wide strategies for inclusion, focused on quality and supported by adequate leadership and teacher training in a lifelong learning perspective. 6. Develop more personalised approaches and systemic responses to support all pupils, as well as provide add- itional help for those with disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special needs. 7. Enhance the relevance of school education with a view to raising pupils\u2019 aspirations and stimulating not just the ability to learn, but also the motivation to learn. 8. Enhance the attractiveness of teaching as a profession, provide relevant in-service training and ensure strong school leadership. 9. Make schools more accountable to society at large, strengthen partnerships between schools and parents, business and local communities, and further integrate formal and non-formal activities. 10. Promote successful inclusive education approaches for all pupils, including those with special needs, by making schools learning communities in which a sense of inclusion and mutual support is nurtured and in which the talents of all pupils are recognised. Monitor the impact of such approaches, in particular with a view to raising access and graduation rates of learners with special needs at all levels of the education system. With regard to vocational education and training, to: 1. Strengthen the acquisition of key competences through voca\u00ad tional pathways and programmes, and better address the needs of disadvantaged learners. 2. Further develop VET provision which allows learners to build their own individualised pathways. 3. Endeavour to ensure that VET systems are properly inte\u00ad grated into the overall education and training systems, including flexible pathways which enable learners to move from one sector to the other, and to employment. 4. Strengthen guidance and counselling activities and relevant teacher training, in order to support students\u2019 career choices and transitions within education or from education to employment. This is particularly important for successful integration into the labour market and for the inclusion of students with special needs. With regard to higher education, to: 1. Promote widened access, for example by strengthening financial support schemes for students and through flexible and diversified learning paths. 2. Develop policies aimed at increasing completion rates of higher education, including through strengthening individualised support, guidance and mentoring for students. 3. Continue to eliminate barriers to, expand opportunities for, and improve the quality of, learning mobility, including by providing adequate incentives for the mobility of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 4. Promote specific programmes for adult students and other non-traditional learners. EN C 135/6 Official Journal of the European Union 26.5.2010 ",
        "With regard to adult education, to: 1. Strengthen policies to enable the low-skilled, unemployed adults and, where appropriate, citizens with a migrant back\u00ad ground to gain a qualification or take their skills a step further (one step up), and broaden the provision of second chance education for young adults. 2. Promote measures to ensure that all have access to the basic skills and key competences needed to live and learn in the knowledge society, in particular literacy and ICT skills. And in general to strengthen the social dimension of education and training systems by: 1. Increasing the flexibility and permeability of education pathways and removing barriers to participation and to mobility within and between education and training systems. 2. Developing closer links between the world of education and the world of work and society at large, with a view to enhancing employability and active citizenship. 3. Establishing systems for the validation and recognition of prior learning, including informal and non-formal learning, and increasing the use of lifelong guidance among disadvantaged and low-skilled learners. 4. Evaluating the impact and effectiveness of financial support measures which target the disadvantaged, as well as the effects of the design of educational systems and structures on the disadvantaged. 5. Considering the collection of data on outcomes, drop-out rates and on learners\u2019 socio-economic backgrounds, particularly in vocational education and training, higher education and adult education. 6. Considering the establishment of quantified objectives in the area of social inclusion through education which are appropriate to the situation of each Member State. 7. Considering the development of an integrated approach to these objectives, in coordination with other policies. 8. Devoting adequate resources to disadvantaged pupils and schools and, where appropriate, extending the use of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Devel\u00ad opment Fund, in order to reduce social exclusion through education. ACCORDINGLY INVITES THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION TO: 1. Pursue cooperation on the strategic priority of promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship, by actively using the open method of coordination within the context of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) and by implementing the social dimension of the Bologna and Copenhagen processes and adopting measures in line with the 2008 Council conclusions on adult learning. 2. Endeavour to make active use of each strand of the lifelong learning programme and, where appropriate, of the European Social Fund, of the European Regional Devel\u00ad opment Fund and of the progress programme, in order to strengthen social inclusion through education and training, and maintain a strong focus on this dimension in the proposals for the next generation of programmes. 3. Promote and support greater participation of learners from disadvantaged backgrounds, or those with special needs, in transnational mobility schemes, partnerships and projects, in particular those established under the Lifelong Learning Programme. 4. Support comparative research on the effectiveness of policies to increase equity in education and training, widen the knowledge base in cooperation with other international organisations and ensure a broad dissemination of research results. 5. Promote the role of education and training as key instruments for the achievement of the objectives of the social inclusion and social protection process.

        "AND RECALLING IN PARTICULAR: The Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (\u2018ET 2020\u2019) ( 1 ), which provide a means of addressing the challenges involved in fully implementing key competences and of improving the openness and relevance of education and training, including through the definition of priority work areas during the 2009-2011 work cycle, the possible development of a benchmark on employability and the adjustment of the coherent framework of indicators, paying special attention to the areas of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES: 1. The current economic crisis, together with the rapid pace of social, technological and demographic change, underline the crucial importance of ensuring that \u2014 through high-quality lifelong education and training, as well as increased mobility \u2014 all individuals, in particular young people, acquire a strong set of competences. 2. Acquiring and further developing competences are crucial to improving employment prospects and contribute to personal fulfilment, social inclusion and active citizenship, since they signal the ability of individuals to act in a self-organised way in complex, changing and unpredictable contexts. As set out in the Key Competences Recommendation, a competent individual is able to combine knowledge, skills and attitudes, and to apply and make use of prior learning (whether acquired formally, non-formally or informally) in new situations. 3. The 2010 joint progress report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the \u2018Education & Training 2010\u2019 work programme recognises that: \u2014 many countries are reforming curricula based explicitly on the key competences framework, particularly in the schools sector, but innovative approaches to teaching and learning need to be developed and implemented on a broader basis, in order to ensure that every citizen can have access to high-quality lifelong learning opportunities; \u2014 there is a particular need to strengthen those competences required to engage in further learning and the labour market, which are often closely interrelated. This means further developing the key competences approach beyond the schools sector, into adult learning and into vocational education and training (VET) linked to the Copenhagen process, and ensuring that higher education outcomes are more relevant to the needs of the labour market. It also means developing ways of evaluating and recording transversal key competences \u2014 which are defined as including learning to learn, social and civic competences, initiative-taking and entrepre\u00ad neurship , and cultural awareness and expression ( 2 ) \u2014 that are relevant for access to work and further learning; \u2014 a \u2018common language\u2019 bridging the worlds of education/ training and work needs to be developed in order to make it easier for citizens and employers to see how competences and learning outcomes are relevant to tasks and occupations. This would further facilitate citizens occupational and geographical mobility; \u2014 in order to enhance citizens\u2019 competences and thus better equip people for the future, education and training systems also need to open up further and become more relevant to the outside world. STRESSING THAT: \u2014 The above challenges call for action at both European and national level, as part of the priority work areas specifically planned for the first 2009-2011 work cycle of ET 2020. The key competences approach needs to be fully imple\u00ad mented in the schools sector, particularly to support the acquisition of key competences and quality learning outcomes for those at risk of educational under-achievement and social exclusion. Teaching and assessment methods need to evolve, and the initial and continuing professional development of all teachers, trainers and school leaders needs to be supported, in line with the competence-based approach. \u2014 However, there is now also a need to clarify, and to consider developing, the link between the various existing European initiatives aimed at strengthening citizen\u2019 competences and at providing a greater focus on learning outcomes, as well as to ensure a consistent approach in this field. This should build on the progress made with implementation of both the Key Competences Recommendation and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), and should connect these to the acquisition of competences and learning outcomes in all relevant settings and at all levels. It should further aim at systematically improving and strengthening the acquisition of competences in education and training, as well as at work. THEREFORE EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTION IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: \u2014 Efforts are needed to show how key competences are relevant at all levels of education and training and in all stages and situations of life. In addition to supporting the implementation of key competences in the areas identified by the 2006 Recommendation, attention should also be paid to making best use of the Recommendation in order to support lifelong learning beyond the end of compulsory education.

        "\u2014 More should be done to support the acquisition, updating and further development of the full range of key competences in the areas of vocational education and training and of adult learning. \u2014 In order to equip students with the competences required by the labour market, as well as for further learning and research activities, priority should also be given in higher education to the updating, acquisition and further devel\u00ad opment of key competences. It is particularly important that higher education institutions provide opportunities for students to develop the ability to communicate in foreign languages, as appropriate, as well as a strong set of trans\u00ad versal key competences, since these are essential for acquiring other skills, adapting to various working environments and being active citizens. \u2014 Curriculum design, teaching, assessment, and learning environments should be consistently based on learning outcomes, i.e. the knowledge, skills and competences to be acquired by learners. Particular emphasis should be placed on those transversal key competences that require cross-curricular and innovative methods. To achieve the transition to a competence-based approach, efforts should also be made to ensure that teachers, trainers and school leaders are equipped to take on the new roles implicit in such an approach. This process can be supported through enhanced partnerships between education and training insti\u00ad tutions and the wider world, especially the world of work. \u2014 More should also be done to adequately assess, record and provide evidence of the competences developed by citizens throughout their lives in formal, non-formal and informal learning environments for the purposes of employment and of access to further learning, as well as for active partici\u00ad pation in society. Flexible pathways in education and training can improve citizens\u2019 employment opportunities, as well as facilitate the identification of their evolving competences and future learning needs. The effectiveness of tools for the identification and recording of competences could be enhanced if a standardised terminology and approach to classification could be adopted by all stake\u00ad holders in both education and training and the labour market, INVITES THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION TO: \u2014 Support the exchange of best practices and national initiatives relating to the areas mentioned above. In line with the work areas planned for the first 2009-2011 work cycle of ET 2020, and making the best use of the expertise and continuing support of Cedefop, this should include taking greater account of transversal key competences in curricula, assessment and qualifications; promoting creativity and innovation by developing specific teaching and learning methods; and developing partnerships between education and training providers, businesses and civil society. \u2014 Support the initial and continuing professional development of all teachers, trainers and school leaders in general education, as well as in vocational education and training, including for the purpose of equipping them to take on the new roles implicit in a competence-based approach. \u2014 Initiate work to clarify how key competences can be continuously developed and adapted to meet the challenges faced by individuals throughout their learning and working lives, by examining and developing inter alia the assessment of key competences at various levels of education and training. In particular, consideration should be given as to whether a link should be established between the learning outcomes-based reference levels promoted by Member States\u2019 implementation of the EQF and the key competences framework. \u2014 Work, in collaboration with the social partners, public employment services and other stakeholders, on the devel\u00ad opment of a common language \u2014 or standardised termi\u00ad nology \u2014 covering European skills, competences and occu\u00ad pations (ESCO). This common language should aim to improve the articulation between competences acquired in learning processes and the needs of occupations and the labour market, and thereby bridge the worlds of education/ training and work. It could both support and build on the implementation of the EQF, by facilitating the description, categorisation and classification of education and training provision, individual learning outcomes and experiences, as well as related employment opportunities. The overall purpose would be to make it easier for citizens, public employment services, careers counsellors, guidance providers and employers to see the relevance of learning outcomes in national qualifications to tasks and occu\u00ad pations, and to use the common language in order to better match skills needs to the labour market. \u2014 Further develop and promote, in collaboration with all the relevant stakeholders, the recognition of non-formal and informal learning, with a view to enabling citizens to engage in further learning and the labour market.

        "Council conclusions of 11 May 2010 on the internationalisation ( 1 ) of higher education (2010/C 135/04) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHEREAS: 1. The Bologna Declaration of 19 June 1999 established an intergovernmental process aimed at creating a European Higher Education Area by 2010 which is actively supported by the European Union, and the Ministers responsible for higher education in the 46 participating countries, meeting in Leuven and Louvain-la-Neuve on 28 and 29 April 2009, called for higher education institutions to further internationalise their activities. 2. The Council Resolution of 23 November 2007 on modernising universities for Europe's competitiveness in a global knowledge economy ( 2 ) invited Member States to promote the internationalisation of higher education insti\u00ad tutions by encouraging quality assurance through inde\u00ad pendent evaluation and peer review of universities, enhancing mobility, promoting the use of joint and double degrees and facilitating the recognition of qualifications and periods of study. 3. The European Union has a long tradition of cooperation with third countries based on a set of policies and instruments in which higher education is playing an increasing role. Cooperation agreements with partners around the world often include support for infrastructure and cooperation programmes in higher education, as well as frameworks for policy dialogues in this field. Cooperation in higher education also features prominently in multilateral cooperation frameworks such as the Union for the Medi\u00ad terranean, the Northern Dimension or the Eastern Part\u00ad nership. 4. Decision No 1298/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 established the Erasmus Mundus 2009-2013 action programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of inter\u00ad cultural understanding through cooperation with third countries ( 3 ). 5. The Tempus IV programme (2007-2013) supports the modernisation of higher education in the partner countries of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean region, mainly through university cooperation projects and partnerships. Other programmes, such as the cooperation programmes with industrialised countries, or Edulink, Nyerere and Alfa , cover academic cooperation activities with other regions of the world. 6. The Marie Curie actions under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development promote excellence and mobility in European research and provide broad support for the development of dynamic world-class human resources in the European research system, taking into account the inherent international dimension of research, NOTING THAT: 1. Higher education is acquiring an increasingly international dimension, as more and more higher education institutions enrol students from third countries, exchange students, staff, projects and knowledge, and engage in international academic and research cooperation. 2. The quality of Europe's higher education institutions and the unparalleled range and depth of studies they offer make those institutions highly attractive to the international academic world, both as study destinations and as partners for joint education and research ventures. 3. In addition, Europe's success in creating tools such as the common reference framework that relates national qualifi\u00ad cations systems and frameworks together around a common European reference ( 4 ), and in developing a common understanding in areas such as quality assurance ( 5 ), is generating increasing interest among global partners. 4. International cooperation programmes and policy dialogues with third countries in the field of higher education not only enable knowledge to flow more freely, but also contribute to enhancing the quality and international standing of European higher education, to boosting research and innovation, to fostering mobility and intercultural dialogue, as well as to promoting international development in accordance with EU external policy objectives, RECALLING THAT: The Council attaches great importance to promoting learning mobility in higher education for students, teaching staff and researchers. Such mobility provides a means of enriching human capital and strengthening employability through the acquisition and exchange of knowledge, the development of linguistic and intercultural competences, and the promotion of interpersonal contacts. Moreover, increasing the flow of knowledge in this way can enhance the capacity for creativity and innovation, EN C 135/12 Official Journal of the European Union 26.5.2010 ( 1 ) For the purposes of this text, the term \u2018internationalisation\u2019 is used to refer to the development of international cooperation activities between EU higher education institutions and those in third countries.

        "NEVERTHELESS AWARE THAT: The global competition to secure ever larger shares of the mobile international student population is increasingly chal- lenging, with other world partners also actively pursuing strategies to promote the opening up of their higher education institutions to the wider world and to attract the best talents. AGREES THAT: 1. International cooperation in higher education is an important and rewarding area which deserves support at both national and EU level. Such cooperation contributes to improving the quality and innovation of teaching, learning and research, and is beneficial to the production of knowledge. Higher education plays a central role in the development of individuals and societies, as it enhances social, cultural and economic development and promotes active citizenship and ethical values. While having special regard for the principle of subsidiarity, cooperation in higher education should therefore form an integral part of the EU's external cooperation policies, and should be adapted to the particular needs, interests and state of development of the partner countries concerned. 2. Support is needed for EU initiatives and programmes which promote higher education cooperation with a European dimension, and which support higher education institutions in working on joint academic projects, in reinforcing European networks and thus in reducing barriers between national systems. Supporting European higher education institutions in cooperating with their global peers plays an important role in promoting quality and excellence. Coop\u00ad eration of this kind has, for instance, contributed to the creation of innovative courses and opened the way to the establishment of transnational joint, double and multiple degrees. EU academic cooperation programmes should be organised in such a way that they develop highly visible and efficient delivery mechanisms and convey clear, consistent and convincing messages throughout the world. 3. The progress achieved in making the degree structure more compatible and more comparable through the pan-European Bologna process, as well as the EU's success in adopting common approaches and tools with regard to the recog\u00ad nition of qualifications and quality assurance, have enhanced the attractiveness of higher education within the Union. There is a shared interest in promoting these devel\u00ad opments worldwide and in responding to the rising interest which third countries are demonstrating. The Bologna Policy Forum which facilitates policy dialogue between the European Higher Education Area and other parts of the world should be welcomed as a tool for exchange on concrete issues of mutual interest. 4. Initiatives which make European higher education more understandable and transparent to international stakeholders can also help to make Europe more attractive as a study destination. The ongoing study aimed at mapping the diversity of higher education institutions\u2019 missions and performances and at assessing the feasibility of a European transparency instrument should be continued with a view to improving readability and lending greater visibility to the particular strengths of European higher education. 5. A growing number of third countries are interested in the common policies and instruments developed by the EU to support Member States in modernising their different education systems, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), and the European Qualifi\u00ad cations Framework (EQF) being amongst those that have attracted particular attention. This is why, in addition to international academic cooperation programmes, policy dialogue in higher education should be further developed with a number of interested world partners, with a view to sharing experience and good practice, building up local capacities and using positive feedback to improve EU policies. 6. International academic cooperation should continue to be an important means for the EU to support the modernisation efforts of its partners, since by offering structured part\u00ad nerships between higher education institutions from the EU and third countries, the EU can contribute to building local capacities \u2014 both within and beyond higher education institutions \u2014 retain qualified university staff, and enhance international academic exchanges and mobility, ACCORDINGLY INVITES THE MEMBER STATES TO: Adopt, in coordination with higher education institutions and while recognising their autonomy and national practices, measures which are aimed at: 1. Fostering a truly international culture within those insti\u00ad tutions, for instance by: (a) promoting cooperation, networking and interaction between higher education institutions, the research world and the business sector at international level, as part of the drive towards a fully functioning knowledge triangle; (b) fostering and supporting the mobility of international students, teachers, researchers and other staff; (c) providing students, teachers, researchers and other stake\u00ad holders in higher education with the training and competences needed to work in an open international environment; (d) recruiting internationally experienced staff who can encourage a more international outlook among native students and teaching staff; EN 26.5.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 135/13 ",
        "(e) ensuring the provision of high quality curricula and the application of teaching methods which take the inter\u00ad national dimension into account; (f) establishing an institutional environment which encourages the participation of students, teaching staff and researchers in international programmes, joint, double and multiple degrees, and research projects; (g) encouraging higher education institutions to develop internationalisation strategies, and/or to include this dimension in their development plans. 2. Increasing the international attractiveness of higher education institutions, for instance by: (a) promoting the academic excellence of European campuses, and improving their international visibility as interesting places to study and conduct research; (b) improving the quality of services supporting the reception, stay and return of international students, teaching staff, researchers and other staff; (c) participating in international cooperation networks, projects and joint education and research programmes; (d) promoting the development of high quality joint, double and multiple degrees, as well as the joint monitoring of theses; (e) facilitating, whilst having due regard to quality assurance mechanisms, the recognition of qualifications and study periods abroad. 3. Promoting the global dimension and awareness of the social responsibility of higher education institutions, for instance by: (a) promoting new and innovative forms of transnational cooperation within the higher education community; (b) fostering and improving equity in access to higher education and international mobility schemes through the provision of adequate incentives and support; (c) returning knowledge to society at both the local, national and global level, thereby helping to meet society\u2019s needs and important social challenges, ACCORDINGLY INVITES THE COMMISSION TO: 1. Develop, in collaboration with the Member States and while fully respecting the autonomy of higher education insti\u00ad tutions, an EU international higher education strategy which is aimed at improving coherence and comple\u00ad mentarity between existing international cooperation initiatives at both EU and national level, and which will continue to promote the attractiveness of European higher education, research and innovation in the EU's external activities, as well as EU cooperation programmes and policies in this field. 2. Ensure that learning and research mobility between the EU and the wider world forms part of that strategy. 3. Continue to support international higher education part\u00ad nerships, international academic cooperation and capacity- building actions, and to facilitate policy dialogue in higher education with interested third countries. 4. Promote the exchange of experience and good practice in this field. EN C 135/14 Official Journal of the European Union 26.5.2010 ",

The eligible sizes are: 3, 4 and 5. 4.3. Geographical area: The geographical growing zone for PGI \u2018Limone di Siracusa\u2019 covers the following municipalities: Augusta, Melilli, Syracuse, Avola, Noto, Rosolini, Floridia, Solarino, Sortino and Priolo Gargallo. EN C 135/26 Official Journal of the European Union 26.5.2010 ",
        "This geographical area does not stretch beyond 10 km from the shores of the Ionian Sea and its altitude is no higher than 210 m above sea level: it is bounded in the North by the south-facing valleys of the Porcaria stream and in the South by the south-facing valleys of the Tellaro river. 4.4. Proof of origin: Every stage in the production process must be monitored and a record made of the inputs and outputs at each stage. The traceability of the product is ensured in this way, as well as by entering the land registry plots on which the product is grown and the names of producers and packers in registers managed by the inspection body, and by declaring the quantities produced to the inspection body in a timely manner. All natural and legal persons whose names appear in the registers will be subject to checks by the inspection body in accordance with the terms of the specification and the corresponding inspection plan. 4.5. Method of production: Planting distances and growing and pruning methods must maintain perfect plant equilibrium and development in addition to providing normal aeration and sunlight exposure. Maximum planting density is 400 plants per hectare. For high-density dynamic planting, the maximum density allowed is 850 plants per hectare. The following rootstocks are used: \u2018Arancio amaro\u2019, \u2018Poncirus trifoliata\u2019, \u2018Citrange Troyer\u2019, \u2018Citrange Carrizo\u2019 and \u2018Citrus macrophylla\u2019, which are highly genetically stable. The fruit has to be harvested from the tree by hand. The fruit must be removed from the tree with the aid of harvesting scissors to cut the stem. The fruit is harvested straight from the tree using traditional methods when it has reached the level of maturity that ensures good organoleptic and aesthetic qualities. Maximum lemon production is 29 tonnes per hectare for the entire marketing year, including the fruit from all flowerings. 4.6. Link: The \u2018Limone di Siracusa\u2019 is characterised by its early ripening, high juice content, its medium to large size and an all-year harvesting period. These particularities are attributable to the soil and climate conditions of the area and the qualities of the cultivar grown in the production area. The \u2018Limone di Siracusa\u2019 is grown along the Sicilian coast and in some limited areas inland around the valleys and rivers that characterise the province of Syracuse. Analysis of average temperatures taken on the coastal plain of Syracuse reveals that the climate in the area is mild from October to March and arid from April to September. Throughout the area, the land is extremely fertile, more or less deep and rich in nutrients and organic matter. Water is the decisive factor for growing lemons. In the \u2018Limone di Sicilia\u2019 production area water resources are guaranteed by the great subterranean river basin of the Hyblaen tableland, which constitutes the largest natural water reserve in the whole of Sicily, as well as by surface watercourses. The availability of water, in combination with atmospheric humidity, plays a decisive role in deter\u00ad mining the quality of \u2018Limone di Siracusa\u2019 fruit, indeed the lack of water stress and an averagely humid atmosphere make it possible to produce juicier fruit that are more regular in shape, with finer peel, and which can be harvested over 12 months of the year. Sicily boasts a citrus growing tradition and the respect for ancient practices in cultivating these plants, handed down from generation to generation, is still alive in the Syracuse region, giving rise to a veritable school of specialists in cultivating the \u2018Limone di Siracusa\u2019.

Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: The area in which the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 is cultivated is a real \u2018orange oasis\u2019 set completely apart from the region's general citrus-growing activity. The orange trees grow on the banks of the Verdura, Magazzolo, Platani and Carboj rivers. The soil, which is made up of vertisols and inceptisols, is excellent for agriculture due both to its high mineral content and its texture. In the summer season, to make up for the lack of rain, the citrus trees in the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 area are irrigated by means of a system of channels using water from the Magazzolo, Carboj and Verdura rivers which has been collected by the Castello, Arancio and Prizzi dams. These rivers provide an ample supply of top quality water with a balanced composition, low conduc\u00ad tivity and no impurities. The proximity to the sea makes for temperature and humidity conditions that are well suited to the ecophysiological needs of the fruit \u2014 very rarely is there any damage from the natural phenomena generally responsible for harming crops, such as ice or sirocco winds. 5.2. Specificity of the product: The specificity of the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 lies in its juiciness and in the low resistance chewing of the membrane between individual segments and the vesicles, generally producing the feeling of the fruit \u2018melting in the mouth\u2019. The \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 is also characterised by a high soluble solids to acids ratio, its crisp, long-lasting taste (which make it particularly suitable for consumption as fresh fruit), its \u2018mildness\u2019 and lack of acidity. Other distinguishing factors are the strong orange colour of the peel and juice. 5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): The characteristics of the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 are linked to a well-established combination of natural factors (climate, terrain, water, etc.) and the professional skills of the local growers. The soil is rich in rapidly assimilable primary minerals and has a high cationic exchange capacity (> 20 meq/100 g), which helps to boost significantly the exchangeable potassium content available for the orange trees. The high availability of potassium, favouring the transfer of sugars from the roots, leaves and branches into the fruit, together with the typically Mediterranean climate, are a key factor in raising sugar levels and improving the taste of the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019. The soil in these parts comes from alluvial sediment and is characterised by a balanced texture linked to the high clay content mitigated by the presence of sand and often shingle, which ensure that air and water can circulate freely. This allows biological processes to take place, such as the establishment of a positive \u2018microflora\u2019 encouraging the synthesis of organic substances, which in turn facilitates the take- up of nutritives and water and contributes to the juiciness of the fruit. The high quality and abundance of water from the Magazzolo, Carboj and Verdura rivers, and the absence of pollutants in the ground are ideal conditions for irrigation and the emergence of the organoleptic qualities of the product. It is these soil and climatic conditions that give the fruit its intense orange colour and above all the juiciness that makes it so suitable as a juicing orange.

        "Markets in Italy have been familiar with the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 since 1950. Its fame was given a major boost by the organisation of the Market Fair in 1966, which was renamed the \u2018Sagra (Festival) dell\u2019Arancia di Ribera\u2019 in 1985. Historical documents testify to the fact that excellent oranges were already being grown in the Verdura valley in the early 1800s; these describe a rich territory with very soft water and products transported to Palermo and exported as far as America. The main players have always been the growers, who have made full use of the perfect match between the varieties and the territory and innovated simply but effectively so that the growing of the \u2018Arancia di Ribera\u2019 has kept pace with the times and new growing requirements without going against tradition and local culture. In this respect, changes have been introduced over the years that have improved efficiency, such as irrigation through a system of low-pressure pipes (which saves water) and the use of pneumatic pruners. For many decades, farming in the Ribera area was the first point of reference for the region as a whole, and in some cases nationally, because of the growers\u2019 professional skills and advanced techniques, and the quality of the produce, which continues to meet with high acclaim.
