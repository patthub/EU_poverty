        "Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries S o c i a l d i a l ogu e a nd E M U i n t h e a cc e d i ng c oun tr i e s Enlargement of the European Union to a further 10 countries in May 2004 will present huge challenges, particularly in the economic sphere. This report documents the industrial relations situation in all 10 acceding countries \u2013 Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia \u2013 as they prepare for Economic and Monetary Union. It is based on joint research carried out by the Foundation in cooperation with the Swedish Work Life and Enlargement project. The report looks at each country\u2019s capacity to support the convergence process towards the Maastricht criteria, by means of national development programmes currently in operation. Above all, it shows how social dialogue can be harnessed to generate economic growth in conjunction with employment and social protection in these countries. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policy making with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research.

        "Foreword v With expansion to a further 10 countries due to take place in May 2004, the European Union faces new challenges. Differing experiences in many areas of work and life call for new initiatives to build on a solid understanding of the situation in these countries as they move towards EU membership. Specifically, the demands of economic and monetary union cannot be underestimated. From May 2004, these countries will be eligible to apply for membership of the Eurozone provided they fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria. How their respective industrial relations systems respond to this challenge will play a crucial role in determining the ease of this transition towards an enlarged union. The main objective of this Foundation research project, carried out in cooperation with the Swedish Work Life and EU Enlargement initiative, was to examine how social dialogue could best be used in preparation for EMU to ensure economic growth in harmony with employment and social protection. This report, \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019, looks at the relevant national systems of industrial relations in this context. In particular, it focuses on the capacity of each country to support the convergence process towards the Maastricht criteria by means of social dialogue \u2013 an important element of the social acquis itself. The report also touches on the political implications of implementation of the EMU criteria. Against this background and in an effort to facilitate the transition process, the report highlights the need for both EU institutions and the social partners in the present Member States to invest time and resources in capacity building for social dialogue in the acceding countries. We trust this report will provide a modest contribution to this mutual learning process. Willy Buschak Acting Director ",

        "Timo Kauppinen and Christian Welz European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions Foundation project: \u2019Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019 Objectives The design of the research project, \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019, is based on two earlier Foundation studies: one on the social implications of economic and monetary union (EMU) in the 15 \u2018old\u2019 Member States of the European Union (2000a) and the other on the subject of \u2018Europeanisation of industrial relations\u2019 (2002b). These two earlier projects influenced to a large extent the present project. The main objective of this project on social dialogue and EMU in the accceding countries is to bring together employers, trade unions, governments and researchers from these countries in order to investigate and assess how social dialogue can best be utilised in the preparation process for EMU. A further objective is to illustrate how social dialogue can be harnessed to generate economic growth in conjunction with employment and social protection in the acceding countries. When this project was initiated in 2001, the countries that had applied to join, or accede to, the European Union were called \u2018candidate\u2019 countries. Since 16 April 2003, following signing of the accession treaties in Athens, those \u2018candidate\u2019 countries have been renamed the \u2018acceding\u2019 countries and are set to join the EU on 1 May 2004. From that time on, they will, as new Member States, be eligible to apply for membership of the Eurozone, provided they fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria (as laid down in Article 121 and the Protocol on the convergence criteria of the Treaty establishing the European Community, see Matjeka et al , 2003). Background Since its launch in 2001, the Foundation\u2019s research project has been carried out in cooperation with the Swedish government\u2019s programme of \u2018Work Life and EU Enlargement\u2019 (for details, see http://www.amv.se/wle). The project was launched at an \u2018exploratory conference\u2019, held in 2001 in Stockholm, when five of the then candidate countries were selected as a pilot group for inclusion in the first phase of research. These countries were Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovenia. They were representative of both small and large countries, as well as \u2018southern\u2019 and \u2018northern\u2019 types. After completion of the pilot phase in 2002, it was decided to enlarge the project in 2003 to include the five remaining acceding countries: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia. In order to achieve the objectives listed above, national reports were produced which analyse in detail the economic, political and industrial relations situation in each of the countries. Another outcome of the project is the drawing up at national level of precise development plans to be implemented by the tripartite stakeholders of the project (i.e. governments, employers and trade unions) in each country. Overview 1 ",
        "Stages of the project The national reports and development projects on social dialogue and EMU in each of the acceding countries were produced in the following phases: 1. Preparatory national meetings . The kick-off in 2002 brought together national government officials and representatives of the social partners in order to explain the project design and to receive their support for both the objectives and the methods to be employed. All tripartite participants at the national meeting readily accepted the objectives and expressed their willingness to participate in the project, which was then subdivided into several components ( see below ). It was also agreed to organise a joint workshop in Vienna for the purpose of drafting the national development plans based on the reports of national experts. This support group also nominated the national experts and selected the participants for the joint multinational workshop. 2. National experts\u2019 reports . National experts prepared the national reports on the economic, political and industrial relations situation in their country of origin from an EMU perspective. 3. Joint Vienna workshops . The workshops were entitled Vienna I (2002) and Vienna II (2003). Five acceding countries participated in the first workshop and the remaining five countries in the second. Each tripartite national team consisted of two representatives from government, as well as two delegates from the trade unions and employer organisations. At the workshop, researchers from each of the five countries presented a background paper on their country of origin. The workshop itself adopted the following methodology: a. Analysis of the current situation . This analysis was based on the report of the national expert ( see http://www.eurofound.eu.int/industrial/social-dialogue/workshop.htm). The national tripartite team made a SWOT analysis of the economic, political and industrial relations situation in its own country. b. Anticipating the future EMU society . In a second step, participants were ask to anticipate future membership of EMU, how and to what extent their country will have to adapt to become a member of the Eurozone. c. Development project . Based on the analysis of the current situation and anticipating the future in the Eurozone, the national tripartite teams drafted a national development project for their respective countries. The national teams selected the topic for the development project and drafted an action plan, with a timetable and responsibilities assigned to the governments and the social partners for implementation. 4. National seminars . Following each workshop, the researchers refined the background studies as well as the development projects. National seminars were held in order to disseminate the results of the workshop and discuss the outcomes among wider national tripartite fora. At the end of the national seminars, it was agreed that the conclusions were to be incorporated into the drafting of the final papers. The amended reports were subsequently sent to the social partners for evaluation and approval. 5. Presidency conference . The final reports of Vienna I were presented at the Danish EU Presidency Conference on \u2018Tripartism in an Enlarged Europe\u2019, held in Elsinore on 29-30 October 2002 (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2003a). 6. Submission to the Ministries of Labour . Next, the social partners, jointly with the Foundation, submitted the reports to the Ministries of Labour and the relevant national tripartite bodies in order to be implemented. 2 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "7. High-level conference The research process and the implementation of the development projects will be assessed during a final conference, which will comprise all 10 acceding countries, to be organised in Spring 2004. The participants will be able to discuss the role of social dialogue in the preparation for EMU in their own countries and will learn from each country\u2019s experiences during the implementation phase of the projects. Foresight methodology The \u2018Social dialogue and EMU\u2019 project used foresight methodology embedded in the industrial relations process of social dialogue and tripartite concertation. The foresight methodology consists of the following main steps ( see Figure 1 ): a. Thinking : This phase started with the analysis of the existing economic, political and industrial relations situation in each country. A national expert drafted this basic analysis, which the national tripartite group then examined and amended. The outcome was a joint view on the current situation in each of the 10 acceding countries. b. Debating : The national tripartite group discussed their future in the Eurozone and envisaged participation in EMU. The outcome of these debates resulted in a more or less joint view of tomorrow\u2019s EMU society. c. Shaping : In the next step, the tripartite delegations began to shape the future by selecting a topic for the joint development project. The group was required to motivate its selection, prepare an action plan and schedule for the project, and assign responsibilities for implementation. d. Implementing : The national development projects also included an implementation phase, which started immediately after the hand-over of the project to the Ministries of Labour and Social Affairs and the competent tripartite bodies. e. Evaluating : A final evaluation of the present project will take place at the international conference in Spring 2004, where all 10 national projects and their eventual implementation will be presented and assessed.

        "Milestones in the development of industrial relations at EU level The evolution of social dialogue The concept of social dialogue in labour relations refers to the relationship, joint discussion, negotiations and, eventually, agreements between employers and trade unions. Social dialogue between employers and trade unions can take different forms, ranging from informal discussions to formal negotiations and collective bargaining. Besides the bilateral relationships between the social partners, there also exist tripartite forms involving European public authorities (such as the European Commission at EU level) or fully fledged tripartite bodies (such as the European Economic and Social Council). Social dialogue can also take place at different levels, starting at the company, via the sectoral, regional, interregional, national and, since its inception in 1952, also at the European level. In the latter case, European social dialogue nowadays takes place when the employers\u2019 organisations UNICE-UEAPME, CEEP and the trade union confederation ETUC are discussing and negotiating EU-level agreements. In the Laeken Declaration of December 2001, the European-level social partners clarified the conceptual difference between social dialogue, tripartite concertation and consultation as follows: (cid:2) tripartite concertation designates exchanges between the social partners and European public authorities; (cid:2) consultation of the social partners describes the activities of advisory committees and official consultations in the spirit of Article 137 of the EC Treaty; and (cid:2) social dialogue is defined as the bipartite work by the social partners, whether or not prompted by the Commission\u2019s official consultations based on Articles 137 and 138 of the EC Treaty ( see http://www.europa.eu.int/futurum/documents/contrib/cont071201_en.pdf). The Treaties of Rome (1957-58) had included a chapter on the free movement of workers and an article on the equal treatment of men and women (former Articles 48 and 119 EC). In 1958, the employers\u2019 organisations created the European-level organisation UNICE and the trade unions followed suit in 1973, an initiative which led to the establishment of the European-level central trade union body ETUC. The roots of European social dialogue go back to the 1970s when social partners were consulted, on an ad hoc basis, on European-level issues. During the same period, the worldwide trade union movement was split into the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFT), in which both the USA and Europe played an important role, and the Soviet Union- led World Trade Union (WTU). Under these circumstances, the development of a European-level industrial relations system was not progressing with great speed. It took almost 30 years before the next decisive step was taken. However, from 1985 onwards, at the initiative of European Commission President Jacques Delors, social dialogue took on an autonomous bipartite form in the preparation for the Single Market. This happened on 31 January 1985, when the EU-level social partners were asked to participate at a high-level meeting in Val Duchesse, a castle situated outside Brussels. The meeting was to reaffirm the importance of the social partners in the process of European integration, which had witnessed a revitalisation with the implementation of the Single Market Programme. It proved to be the first step in what became known as the \u2018Val Duchesse/Palais d\u2019Egmont\u2019 period of dialogue (1985-93), when bipartite social partner activities took place, consisting principally of joint opinions, resolutions and declarations; two joint working parties were formed to act as the vehicle for action. 4 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The Maastricht Treaty of 1991 marked a new phase in the social dialogue process. New social policy provisions became part of the Social Protocol, first annexed to the Maastricht Treaty and later integrated into the EC Treaty by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997. These established a new mechanism by means of which European-level agreements could be negotiated and, if the social partners so desired, transposed into the national legislation of the Member States by means of a directive or voluntary agreement. It was on this basis that the first negotiations of the social partners took place and agreements were signed on parental leave (1995), part-time work (1997) and fixed-term contracts (1999), subsequently to be implemented as directives (European Commission, 2002a). 1 In July 2002, the social partners concluded a European collective agreement on telework (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions/European Commission, 2003c); this agreement is not destined to be forged into a directive, but the agreement will be transposed via national collective agreements in three years\u2019 time (deadline for implementation is 16 July 2005) via the so-called \u2018voluntary route\u2019 (Kirton- Darling and Clauwaert, 2003). If this initiative proves successful, it is almost certain that this agreement will be followed by other European collective agreements in due course. The European Employment Strategy (EES) agreed upon in Luxembourg in 1997 gave social partners the right to participate in drafting national action plans implementing the EES and to shape decision-making in this area via the open method of co-ordination (OMC). (For the application of OMC to the field of industrial relations, see European Commission, 2002c, and European Parliament, 2003.) This new method of decision-shaping via European \u2018soft\u2019 law involves: (cid:2) fixing guidelines for the Union, combined with specific timetables for achieving the goals which are set in the short, medium and long-term; (cid:2) establishing, where appropriate, quantitative and qualitative indicators and benchmarks against the best in the world, tailored to the needs of different Member States and sectors, as a means of comparing best practices; (cid:2) translating these European guidelines into national and regional policies, by setting specific targets and adopting measures, taking into account national and regional differences; and (cid:2) periodic monitoring, evaluation and peer review, organised as mutual learning processes. The so-called \u2018Cologne process\u2019 of 1999 gave social partners the possibility of participating in European-level macroeconomic dialogue, together with the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Presidency. In the same year, the European Commission initiated the setting up of sectoral social dialogue fora. Currently, there are 27 different sectoral committees striving to promote sectoral social dialogue (European Commission, 2002f). The sectoral social dialogue at EU level covers about 70 million employees (Weber, 2001). In addition to this secondary community law-making, European-level industrial relations are also being shaped by the crossborder collective bargaining processes. In 1995, the European 5 Overview 1 Council Directive 96/34/EC of 3 June 1996 on the framework agreemment on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC, O.J.

        "Metalworkers\u2019 Union launched an initiative to co-ordinate collective bargaining by gathering and distributing information from different EU countries. Another example of crossborder co-ordination of collective bargaining surfaced in 1998 with the Doorn initiative. (The \u2018Doorn group\u2019 takes its name from the Dutch town where the unions concerned adopted a joint declaration which expressed a strong need for close crossborder co-ordination of collective bargaining within the Economic and Monetary Union). The Doorn declaration represented the first time that unions from different European countries had determined a set of joint bargaining guidelines in order to prevent possible downward competition in wages and working conditions. Only very recently, the European Convention, via the new EU constitutional treaty, has reiterated the importance of autonomous and independent social partners as an element of the acquis communautaire in Article I-47: \u2018The European Union recognises and promotes the role of the social partners at Union level, taking into account the diversity of national systems; it shall facilitate dialogue between the social partners, respecting their autonomy.\u2019 2 The evolution of worker participation As a complement to social dialogue, the European industrial relations agenda has fostered workers\u2019 rights considerably with regard to company involvement over the past decade. A small step for European integration, but a big step for transnational workers\u2019 involvement was reached in 1994 with the European Works Council (EWC) Directive, allowing for the creation of EWCs in companies that employ more than 1,000 workers in the EU, with at least 150 workers in each of two Member States. In 2002, about 1,865 companies fell under the application of the EWC Directive: 739 companies have set up an EWC, which corresponds to a compliance rate of 34.3%. Thus, 1,200 companies have still to set up a European Works Council (Waddington and Kerckhoffs, 2003; see also European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2001, 2000b and 1997). The next step towards the Europeanisation of worker involvement saw the light with the conclusion of Directive 2002/14/EC of the Council and European Parliament of 11 March 2002, establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community (OJ L 80, 23.03.2002). In 1997, the Commission had launched a phase of consultation with the social partners which broke up because of the absence of a consensus among the social partners on this issue. Consequently, the Commission presented a proposal aimed at establishing a general framework for employee information and consultation in undertakings located in the European Community. When defining or implementing this framework, employer and employee representatives must work in a spirit of co-operation and with due regard for their reciprocal rights and obligations. Worker information and consultation covers three areas in relation to undertakings: (a) economic, financial and strategic developments; (b) structure and foreseeable development of employment and related measures; and (c) decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or contractual relations. 6 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 2 The European Convention, Secretariat, Brussels, 12 June 2003, Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, CONV 797/1/03, Rev. 1, Vol. I; available at http://www.european-convention.eu.int/docs/Treaty/cv00850.en03.pdf ",
        "The scope of the Directive is defined in Article 3; it shall apply to: a) undertakings employing at least 50 employees in any one Member State, or b) establishments employing at least 20 employees in any Member State. The deadline for the implementation of Directive 2002/14 is March 2005 (or March 2007 for certain Member States). The last footprint so far made by the Europeanisation of worker involvement is to be found in the creation of the \u2018Societas Europea/SE\u2019. The European Company Statute, the first draft of which goes back more than 30 years, was finally enshrined in 2001. The European Company (Societas Europea) has become a reality via a regulation and a directive concerning worker involvement. 3 Under the accompanying directive on worker involvement, the creation of an SE necessitates negotiations on the involvement of employees with a body representing all the workers concerned. In the event of failure of these negotiations, a set of common rules, as fixed in an annex to the directive, would have to apply. In a nutshell, these principles oblige SE managers to provide regular reports on the basis of which regular information and consultation of a body representing the companies\u2019 employees must take place. In some cases, the directive also provides for board-level participation of the employees. The Council Directive 2001/86/EC has to be implemented by all Member States by October 2004. Social dialogue and the EMU convergence process Social dialogue played a central role in the EMU convergence process in many of the EU 15 Member States ( see , for example, D\u00f8lvik, 2000; Kauppinen, 1998; Kittel, 2002). This is the main conclusion of a research project initiated by the Foundation on the \u2018Social impact of EMU 1998- 2000\u2019 (2000a). The governments depended on the support of the social partners and the latter eagerly grasped the chance to influence the pace and content of the adaptation process. National- level social pacts between the social partners and the state in relation to the EMU convergence were concluded in seven countries. Moderate wage policies supported the low inflation target which, in turn, had a positive impact on the other EMU criteria. The Foundation research project covering the \u2018Europeanisation of industrial relations\u2019 (2002b) also found that different models of industrial relations prevail in the 15 Member States of the EU, ranging from very centralised models (as in Finland, Ireland and Belgium) to company-level models of collective bargaining (as in France and the UK). In France and the UK, collective agreements are decentralised to the company level. In France, company-level agreements extend to sectoral agreements and agreements are by law extended to cover non-unionised employees. In spite of the decentralised nature of social dialogue, wage development in the run-up to EMU was very moderate, supporting the government targets of low inflation and sound public finances (Deinert, 1999). The most common procedure to negotiate wages in the EU Member States is through sectoral-level 7 Overview 3 Council Regulation 2001/2157/EC of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE), O.J. L 294/1, 10.11.2002, and Council Directive 2001/86/EC of 8 October 2001 supplementing the Statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of employees, O.J. L 294/11, 10.11.2001. ",
        "collective bargaining. In the acceding countries, however, decentralised company-level collective agreements are the norm, similar to the USA and Japan. The third group of countries, which includes Germany, Austria and Italy, adapted to the EMU convergence criteria by means of sectoral collective agreements. In these countries, sectoral collective agreements were aimed at supporting the general EMU policy process of the government. Wage agreements were moderate, consisting of only 1-3% of nominal increase, and reforms regarding the systems of social protection were moderate and modest. In spite of the very different models, the Foundation research reveals that social dialogue played a decisive role in the adaptation process towards the Maastricht convergence criteria. In Spain, Portugal and Greece, the governments gained strong support from the social partners for the convergence process. In Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, the social partners negotiated social pacts for moderate wage increases and the government supported the agreement with tax reliefs and social packages. The outcomes were very moderate, centralised collective agreements, which supported the governments\u2019 economic policy targets of adapting to the EMU convergence criteria. There is a general consensus that these social pacts have been instrumental in some of the \u2018old\u2019 Member States in the successful preparation for the Maastricht criteria and the introduction of the euro (Lado, 2003). Finally, it is worth mentioning that even in Sweden, Denmark and the UK \u2014 countries that availed of the opt-out clause for EMU \u2014 the social partners were supportive of government policies for adapting to the Maastricht criteria at arms-length.

        "Political environment in the acceding countries The political environment in the acceding countries has changed dramatically in the course of the last 13 years, ever since they gained independence at the beginning of 1990s ( see Figure 2 ). Old power structures have disappeared and new parties have emerged based on democratic parliamentary elections. Changes were the only constant phenomenon over this period of time and it is virtually impossible to draw a picture reflecting the political environment in all 10 acceding countries. Nevertheless, some country-specific or even common political trends may be highlighted. Cyprus : In the early 1990s, a centre-right coalition was backing the Cypriot government. In 2003, a coalition of AKEL (left wing), DHKO (centre-right) and KISOS (Social Democratic) has supported the election of Mr Papadoupolos for President and has since formed the government. Czech Republic : After a long period of a right-wing coalition government until 1998, a minority Social Democratic government came into power in 1998 and repeated its victory in 2002, forming a left-wing coalition with a one vote majority in Parliament. Estonia : Swing from left and centre-left (1995-99) to right-wing parties (1999-2002) in power. Hungary : Alternation between Conservative (1990-94, 1998-2002) and Socialist Liberal parties (1994-98, 2002- ) succeeding each other in government. Latvia : A centre-right-wing coalition was in place in 1990; this situation had not changed in 2002. Lithuania : From 1992 to 1996, a left-wing coalition ruled the country, which was overthrown by the right-wing political parties from 1996-2000. Since 2001, a Liberal Social Democratic majority accounts for the majority in the Seimas. Malta : The Nationalist Party has been in power since 1985 except for a short interregnum of the Labour Party from 1996 to 1998, in the course of which it withdrew the Maltese application for EU membership. Poland : After the regime shift in the late 1980s, Poland was characterised by an \u2018entropy of the poltical scene\u2019 (Nalewajko, 1994). This is why a precise positioning of the political affiliation of the 1993 government is impossible due to the existence of a multi-party coalition at that time. The political situation seems to be stabilised since 2001, however, with the coming to power of the Democratic Left Alliance, advocating social-democratic values. Slovakia : From 1994 to 2002, always a centre-right \u2013 centre-left coalition (predominance of the left in 1994 and of the right in 1998) has ruled the country. In 2002, for the first time, a purely right- wing government held the greatest share of seats in Parliament. Slovenia : After an early right-wing coalition in the late 1980s, the political situation in Slovenia, in contrast to many other \u2018transitional\u2019 societies, was marked by a rather stable relative prevalence of a centre-left party, i.e. the Liberal Democrats. 9 Overview ",
        "Economic environment in the light of Maastricht criteria The impact of EMU on employment policies and industrial relations in the acceding countries is potentially far-reaching. Since the focus of EMU is on monetary stability, it presents a real challenge for national policies aiming at growth, with direct consequences for employment levels in the acceding countries. Once they have become full members of the EU, the acceding countries will have to adapt their economies gradually to the Maastricht criteria ( see Figure 3 ) if they desire to join the Eurozone. 4 Is social dialogue able to play an important role in this process? Is it possible for the acceding countries to draw on the experiences of the present Member States? These were the crucial questions to be addressed when the project on \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019 was initiated. Figure 3 Maastricht criteria \u2022 High degree of price stability (variable: rate close to 3.8% in 2000) \u2022 Convergence in long-term interest rates (variable: 6.75% in December 2000) \u2022 Low budget deficit (3% of GDP) \u2022 Low national debt (60% of GDP) \u2022 Observance of the normal fluctuation margins within the European Monetary System for two years In the background reports, the national experts benchmarked their countries\u2019 economic and financial performance against the Maastricht criteria. The following sections will briefly summarise the main findings of the 10 national reports regarding inflation, budget deficit, gross foreign debt, interest rates and labour costs. Inflation The EU Member States designed a new consumer price index (CPI) in order to meet the obligations in the Maastricht Treaty, as a part of the preparations for the common currency. The aim was to produce CPIs that are comparable between Member States. The main task was to harmonise methodologies and coverage. The result was the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), illustrating that inflation in the 15 EU countries has been between 2-3% since 1999 when the Eurozone was established; one reason for these low inflation figures was the moderate (2-3% per year) wage increases across most Member States. The highest inflation figures are to be found in Ireland, where inflation has steadily progressed by 4-5% per year. 10 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 4 As laid down by Article 121 EC Treaty and Articles 1-4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria: \u2018The ratio of government deficit to gross domestic product must not exceed 3%. The ratio of government debt to gross domestic product must not exceed 60%. There must be a sustainable degree of price stability and an average inflation rate, observed over a period of one year before the examination, which does not exceed by more than 1.5% that of the 3 best-performing Member States in terms of price stability. There must be a long-term nominal interest rate which does not exceed by more than 2% that of the 3 best-performing Member States in terms of price stability. The normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism on the European monetary system must have been respected without severe tensions for at least the last 2 years before the examination.\u2019 ",
        "A similar alignment process has taken place in the acceding countries. In view of future enlargement, it is equally important that their economic performance is assessed on the basis of comparable indices. The first stage to harmonisation is the interim HICP (or proxy HICP), based largely on existing national CPIs, adapted to the HICP coverage and methodology ( see Table 1 ). At the moment, they are not yet fully compliant with the HICPs of the Member States, but the figures are the best available for comparative purposes. Table 1 Interim HICP for all items Annual average rate of change in % 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 CY \u2013 3.3 2.3 1.1 4.9 CZ \u2013 9.1 8.0 9.7 1.8 EE 19.8 9.3 8.8 3.1 3.9 HU 23.5 18.5 14.2 10.0 10.0 LV \u2013 8.1 4.3 2.1 2.6 LT 24.7 8.8 5.0 0.7 0.9 MT 2.5 3.1 2.4 2.1 2.4 PL \u2013 15.0 11.8 7.2 10.1 SK 5.8 6.1 6.7 10.6 12.1 SI 9.9 8.3 7.9 6.1 8.9 Source : Eurostat, 2002. As Table 1 shows, in 2000 in most of the 10 acceding countries (called AC 10 from here on), inflation was well above the level of what this EMU criteria would have been in the same year, i.e. 3.8% (CPI: 2.3% + 1.5%). 5 Only the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta fulfilled this criterion in 2000. The highest inflation figures, above 10%, were found in Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. A general trend, however, is that inflation is gradually decreasing in almost all of the AC 10. Looking at the higher level of inflation in the AC 10, being 5.75% in 2000 compared to 2.3% inflation in the EU 15, one can draw the conclusion that social dialogue, potentially, has an important role to play in the adaptation process of these transition economies towards the Maastricht criteria. Budget deficit According to this EMU criterion, the ceiling of the overall public debt is limited to 3% of the gross national product. Eurostat (the EU statistical office) has tried to gather comparable statistics on the issue. At the moment, the government deficit/surplus statistics of the acceding countries are provisional, in the sense that they do not yet fully comply with EU methodological requirements ( see Table 2 ). Broadly speaking, the general government deficit/surplus refers here to the national accounts concept of consolidated general government net borrowing/net lending of the European system of integrated economic accounts (ESA-95). For most countries, the series is available from 1997; 1996 data are an approximation of national accounts data, derived from international monetary fund statistics. 11 Overview 5 To be calculated on the grounds of Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the EC Treaty.

Budget deficit is one of the main criteria of EMU. According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the procedure for an excessive bugetary deficit, the latter should not be in excess of 3% (Matjeka, Reich and Welz, 2003). However, almost five years of experience of the Eurozone have shown that some of the present Member States, such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, are confronted with budget deficits higher than the required figure (almost 4%). For the first time, the European Commission appears set to fine a Member State (France) e 4.5 billion because of its breach of the Stability and Growth Pact. 6 As for the AC 10, the status of the budget deficit in 2000 was rather heterogeneous: a number of acceding countries fulfilled this criterion without any problems, such as Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia. Another group of ACs came rather close to the 3% ceiling (Cyprus, Hungary, Lithuania and Poland). A third category, however, quite clearly missed the target (Czech Republic, Malta and Slovakia). In 2002, the budgetary deficit has been on the increase in four of the ACs (Cyprus, Hungary, Latvia and Poland), whereas in the other six countries it has decreased. On an average basis, however, the budgetary deficit in 2002 for all 10 ACs was 4.7%, compared to 3.8% in 2001 ( Agence Europe , 2003). The budget deficit criterion is within the realm of a Member State\u2019s responsibility, but social dialogue has an indirect impact on the budgetary discipline via social policy provisions. Therefore it is fair to say that social dialogue may play an important role in reaching the EMU budget deficit criterion. Gross foreign debt Gross foreign debt can be used as an approximation for the national debt, even if the internal debt figures are not included. Gross foreign covers both short and long term, but excludes equity 12 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 6 As laid down in the Council regulation on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and co- ordination of economic policies (EC) No. 1466/97, 7 July 1997, and the Council regulation on the speeding up and clarifying of the excessive deficit procedure (EC) No. 1467/97, 7 July 1997.

        "investment and money market instruments. The figures in Table 3 allow the assumption that all ACs, with the exception of Cyprus and Malta, fulfilled this specific EMU criterion in 2000. In Cyprus, the gross foreign debt was around 74.9% and in Malta as high as 272.7%.

Looking at the trends, it is obvious that since 1996 gross national debt has increased in six acceding countries, stayed stable in two and was reduced in two. As a general observation, one may conclude that gross foreign debt seems to be more or less under control in all ACs except Malta. Over the last two years, however, gross public debt has been on the increase again in the 10 ACs: on average, the figures stepped up from 36.9% of GDP in 2001 to 40% in 2002 ( Agence Europe , 2003), a figure which is, however, still well below the Maastricht criteria of 60% of GDP. Only Cyprus and Malta are not expected to meet this target in 2003.

Interest rates The European Central Bank (ECB), as an independent institution, fixes the level of interest rates in the Eurozone. As the ECB Monthly Bulletins show, long-term interest rates have come down from 13 Overview ",
        "4.75% in December 2000 to 2.0% in August 2003, due to, inter alia, a moderate inflation development. In the AC 10, interest rates are also decided upon by the national central banks and these rates are an important indicator of the stance of monetary policy. The type of rates used by the central banks depends on the structure of the financial system ( see Table 4 ). Generally, rates are used to increase or reduce liquidity in the banking system and in the money market. The discount rate (shown below when available) is normally the rate at which the central bank discounts securities from commercial banks and represents the floor to money market interest rates. Looking at the rates in Table 4, we can see that in 2000 interest rates varied considerably from one AC to another. The highest (re)/discount rates existed in Poland (at 19.0%), while the lowest were in Latvia (at 1.5%). As a general trend, in the years 1996 to 2000 one can identify that long-term interest rates are coming down at the same time as inflation figures. Social dialogue, of course, has no direct impact on the interest rate development, but an indirect effect lies in the control of inflation via the moderation of wages as well as of labour-related costs. Labour costs Wages and labour-related costs are the main components of the national collective bargaining process. In contrast to the present 15 EU Member States, where the yearly nominal wage increases have been around 2-3% over the past years, nominal wage increases in the 10 ACs have been about 3-4% higher. In the longer term, this will lead to a situation where the acceding countries will have reached a comparative wage level, but at the moment the cost advantages related to wages and labour-related costs are still striking ( see Figure 4 ).

        "In the nine ACs shown in Figure 4 (no data available for Malta), the average hourly wage level is about e 4.79, ranging from e 2.42/hour in Latvia to e 10.74/hour in Cyprus. (In the two candidate countries of Bulgaria and Romania, labour costs are even lower, between e 1.35 and e 1.51 per hour.) Looking at the composition of labour costs in the ACs, we find about 75% is composed of wages and 25% of employers\u2019 social contributions ( see Table 5 ). Net wage costs range from 67.1% in Hungary to 84.7% in Cyprus. Employers\u2019 social contributions are the highest in Hungary, with 30.3%, in contrast to 14.1% in Slovenia. These labour cost figures in ACs are similar to those of the EU 15, where the average composition is also around 75% for wages and labour-related costs vary from 12.4% in Ireland to 29.6% in Sweden. In the EU 15, however, average labour costs are about e 22.19 per hour, which is five times the amount of the hourly labour costs in the acceding countries. Against this background, company relocations have already taken place (Meardi, 2003) 7 or are easily foreseeable in the near future. Nevertheless, neither the present Member States nor the acceding countries should be seen as a monolithic bloc: hourly labour costs in Sweden ( e 29) are 3.5 times higher than in Portugal ( e 8), and Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia also have labour costs above those of Portugal.

        "Wages and employers\u2019 social contributions are the two main elements of total labour costs. The differences in labour costs sketched above constitute a key element in a country\u2019s competitive edge. This exemplifies the eminent importance of social dialogue and collective agreements in a country\u2019s convergence process towards EMU. The national governments have to embrace the views of the social partners and take them on board when drafting a successful road map to the Eurozone. Industrial relations environment Social dialogue is an important element in industrial relations. The impact of social dialogue on the political and economic development of a country depends, however, on the representativeness and institutional capacity of the social partners involved, as well as on the efficiency and effectiveness of the national industrial relations processes. The following sections presents a short analysis of the main features of industrial relations in the acceding countries and some comparisons are drawn with the 15 EU Member States. Trade union density With trade union membership being compulsory under the communist regime, union density rates were about 90%. Since the start of transition in central and eastern Europe, these rates have been in decline. The results from the national reports show that, in 2002-03, the unionisation rates in the acceding countries are at a rather low level, with, on average, only one third of employees belonging to a trade union ( see Figure 5 ). The strongest unions are found in the public sector, especially among teachers and nurses. In newly created companies, the unionisation quota is at an even lower level. In Estonia, for example, only 1-2% of employees working in newly established companies are unionised (Antila and Yl\u00f6stalo, 2003). Figure 5 Level of trade union density in the acceding countries in 2002 (%) The lowest unionisation rates are found in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, where less than one fifth of employees are unionised. The highest figures, about 60-70%, exist in Malta and Cyprus. Unionisation rates in the AC 10 are, on average, about 10% lower compared to those in the EU 15. 16 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 E U 1 5 a v e r a g e A C 1 0 a v e r a g e C Y M T S I S K C Z L V HU P L L T E E Source: EIRO 2002 and national reports. Unweighted data (not taking into account the respective size of the labour force). ",
        "The following factors may explain this lower trade union density in the ACs, which is still in decline: (cid:2) the economic transition and restructuring process; (cid:2) privatisation; (cid:2) company structure being composed of a relatively high level of microfirms and small and medium-sized enterprises (Lado and Vaughan-Whitehead, 2003); (cid:2) increasing foreign ownership of companies (Cox and Mason, 2000); and (cid:2) increasing use of fixed-term contracts ( ibid. ). Employers\u2019 affiliation rates Comparative information about the affiliation of national-level employers\u2019 organisations is lacking, but first analyses show that these organisations are numerous, disparate and lacking influence and impact. As shown in Figure 6, rough figures (expressed as a percentage of enterprises being affiliated to employers\u2019 associations) for membership in employers\u2019 organisation are 20-60% of industrial enterprises in the eastern European countries and 60-75% in Cyprus and Malta (Cox and Mason, 2000; European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2002c). Some of the higher levels of employers\u2019 affiliation in eastern Europe are found in Slovenia (60%) and Slovakia (50%). Figure 6 Employers\u2019 affiliation rates in the acceding countries in 1999-2002 (%) Employers\u2019 organisations are more inclined to lobby governments than to negotiate collective agreements. This may be due to the fact that a large number of employers\u2019 organisations in the acceding countries assume, at the same time, the role of industry and business associations, or, similarly, the role of chambers of industry, commerce and trades. (Exceptions to this rule are Latvia, Poland and Romania, see Lado, 2002.) This low level of employers\u2019 organisation rates is one additional reason for the lack of a well- functioning social dialogue in the acceding countries. According to the European Commission 17 Overview 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 MT CY SI SK HU LV CZ PL Source: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2002c, p.4; Lado/Vaughan-Whitehead, 2003, p.70. The figure for SI is based on the % of workforce employed by ZDS. ",
        "(2002a), \u2018\u2026 the most significant weakness of industrial relations since the beginning of the transition lies in the lack of organised and representative employers\u2019 organisations at the national and intermediary levels\u2019. Figure 7 illustrates the fragmentation 10 and heterogeneity of trade unions and employers\u2019 national- level organisations in all the acceding countries except Latvia, where there is only one central trade union and employers\u2019 organisation. The highest number of trade unions and employers\u2019 organisations is found in Hungary, where seven trade unions and nine employers\u2019 organisations coexist. All in all, there are 48 trade union confederations and 51 employers\u2019 organisations in the 10 acceding countries. Figure 7 Social partner organisations in the acceding countries Besides this fragmentation, the absence of employers\u2019 organisations in the public sector is a striking factor of the industrial relations systems in the acceding countries, especially when seen against the background of the role these actors played at Member State and EU level (Lado and Vaughan- Whitehead, 2003). Experience from EU Member States shows that the more national organisations there are, the more difficult it is to reach an agreement between all the parties concerned. Decentralised collective bargaining The national reports on \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019 show that in most of the ten acceding countries (AC 10), the system of industrial relations is very decentralised. Wage 18 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 10 Between 1992 and 1994, employers\u2019 organisations in eastern Europe increased from about 30 to 100, the largest numbers to be found in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland; see Cox and Mason, 2000. 02468 10 12 14 16 HU TR RO SI MT BG CZ LT CY PL SK EE LV Source: European Commission, 2002a.

        "negotiations take place mainly at company level ( see Figure 8 ). Only in the public sector do negotiations take place at sectoral level and in this sector also the rate of unionisation is quite high. Slovenia is the only country where the social partners negotiate at intersectoral level. In Slovakia and Cyprus, the main level of collective bargaining is sectoral. The Slovenian industrial relations system is characterised by general national agreements which are not of a voluntary nature and do impact on sectoral agreements to a large extent insofar as the latter have to comply with the former. In Slovakia, almost all the economic sectors of the country are covered by sectoral agreements, which are the outputs of a voluntary collective bargaining process (Lado, 2002). In the remaining seven ACs, wage bargaining is extremely decentralised. Figure 8 Level of collective bargaining (wages) in the acceding countries in 2002 Source : EIRO (2002) and national reports. Coverage of collective agreements The ultimate purpose of sectoral social dialogue is to conclude sectoral collective agreements. When counting the number of sectoral agreements in the ACs during 1998-2002, the highest figures are to be found in Slovakia, where the social partners have concluded more than 100 sectoral collective agreements ( see Figure 9 ). At the other end of the scale, the lowest figures can be found in Latvia and Cyprus, where social dialogue has led to approximately 10 agreements. However, the mere number of collective agreements is not a sufficient indicator for the coverage of the workforce by these agreements. A defining indicator of the European social model, when contrasted with that of the USA, is the level of trade union density and the consequent coverage of collective bargaining. The unweighted average union density of the 15 EU Member States in 2000 was 43.8%. However, the largest countries have a considerably lower density, so that the weighted EU average is only 30.4%. In contrast, trade union density in the USA in 2000 was 13.5%, lower than any EU country except France, at 9.1% (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2002c). 19 Overview Government Trade union Slovenia Cyprus Slovakia Czech Republic Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania Malta Poland Intersectoral level Employers' Intersectoral level Sectoral level Sectoral level Company level Company level ",
        "Figure 9 Number of sectoral collective agreements in 1998-2000 The low level of unionisation is also reflected in the coverage of collective agreements in the acceding countries ( see Figure 10 ). The low level of unionisation in the acceding countries seems, at first sight, to be related to the low level of collective agreement coverage. In four ACs (Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia), collective agreements are extended by legislation also to cover non-unionised employees.

In Slovakia and Hungary, almost 50% of employees are covered; in Cyprus, the figure is about two-thirds. Virtually 100% of the workforce are protected by collective agreements in Slovenia, a figure equalled in the present EU Member States only by Austria and Belgium. This is due to the fact that membership of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry is compulsory for Slovenian companies, thus boosting the coverage rate of collective agreements concluded by these enterprises. Compared to the EU 15 (76.8%), the coverage rate of collective agreements in the AC 10 is about 30% lower ( see http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/2002/12/feature/TN0212101F.html). Worker participation In the AC 10, works council-type structures only exist in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. However, only in Hungary and Slovenia are these bodies comparable with the fully fledged Western continental type of works councils and the overall situation of works councils in the ACs is one of relative weakness (Cox and Mason, 2000). In Poland, works councils are only to be found in state-owned companies, which, in the wake of privatisation, are on a steady decline. The Czech Republic and Slovakia have introduced works councils very recently; they may only be set up, however, in enterprises with no union representation in place. The necessary implementation of the acquis communautaire in the field of worker involvement is certainly likely to foster this development in the ACs (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2002c; Kohl and Platzer, 2003a). As for the spread of European Works Councils (EWC) in the acceding countries, the incidence of these (expressed as the number of EWCs/number of workers\u2019 representatives from that specific AC) is highest in Poland (206/23) and lowest in Estonia (22/2). According to Kohl and Platzer (2003b), figures for other acceding countries with EWCs are the Czech Republic (117/6), Hungary (114/23), Slovakia (57/16) and Slovenia (24/3). Conclusion Research from the Foundation\u2019s project into \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019, as well as input from the social partners, reveals that the industrial relations systems in the acceding countries remain in a fragile state ( see Figure 11 ). (For the outcomes of the industrial relations systems of the ACs in terms of working conditions, see European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2003b and 2002a; also available on http://www.eurofound.eu.int/working/ccindex.htm.) The following reasons for this are given: 1. Heterogeneous trade union and employer organisations \u2013 weak employer organisations \u2013 fragmented employer and trade union organisations \u2013 lack of employers\u2019 organisations in the public sector \u2013 low employers\u2019 association affiliation rates \u2013 low trade union density \u2013 trade union density still falling in some cases \u2013 lack of representativeness from an EU perspective \u2013 social partners less likely to have a collective bargaining role 21 Overview ",
        "2. Limited scope and quality of collective bargaining \u2013 collective bargaining systems more decentralised \u2013 less emphasis on the sectoral level (Ghellab and Vaughan-Whitehead, 2003) \u2013 more company-level collective bargaining \u2013 lower level of collective bargaining coverage \u2013 collective agreements poor in content (Lado and Vaughan-Whitehead, 2003) 3. Widespread absence of works councils \u2013 except for Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland (public enterprises only) \u2013 fully fledged Western-type works councils exist only in Hungary and Slovenia \u2013 EWCs already present in some of the ACs (Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia) 4. Lack of social dialogue in the public sector (European Commission, 2002a) \u2013 absence of employers\u2019 organisations in the public sector 5. Tripartite structures \u2013 asymmetrical structures, reflected in strong governments in contrast to weak social partners \u2013 sometimes adverse government interventions Figure 11 Role of tripartism in the acceding and candidate countries in 2002 Source : European Commission, 2002a. With regard to the outputs of the industrial relation systems in the acceding countries, the following preliminary conclusions can be drawn: 11 (cid:2) lower employment/higher unemployment rates (cid:2) less employment in services, more in agriculture 22 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 11 In comparison to the present 15 EU Member States: for the findings concerning the industrial relations outputs in the ACs, see European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2003b and 2002c. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 CONSULTATION N E G O T I A T I O N Dominant Dominant Negligeable HU SK SL LV LT CY MT PL RO TU CZ BG EE ",
        "(cid:2) higher participation rate of women \u2013 more often in managerial positions \u2013 less affected by part-time work \u2013 less horizontal and vertical gender segregation (cid:2) part-time/fixed-term employment less common, but increasing (cid:2) more workers in small entities (microfirms/SMEs) (cid:2) workers tend to be older (cid:2) pay rates are considerably lower 12 (cid:2) working hours are longer (cid:2) work organisation is more traditional (cid:2) more employment in agriculture and industries, less in services (cid:2) higher proportion of self-employed (cid:2) work intensity is lower (cid:2) worker information and consultation less common (cid:2) workers receive less training The role of the social partners and social dialogue in the ACs, both in the light of enlargement and the preparation process for EMU, is far from being negligible. On the one hand, social dialogue is an important element of the social acquis itself, as recently corroborated in Articles 1-47 of the new Constitutional Treaty. On the other hand, it is also an important implementation tool of the acquis communautaire in the field of social policy, where the expertise of the social partners is needed according to the principle of horizontal subsidiarity. Both the EU institutions and the social partners in the present Member States have to invest time and money in capacity building for social dialogue in the acceding countries. The present research project, \u2018Social dialogue and EMU\u2019, co-managed by the Foundation and the Swedish Work Life and Enlargement Programme, has tried to give a modest input into this mutual learning process. National development projects in the 10 acceding countries In the course of the Vienna workshops, each national tripartite team had to select one topic for its national development project. The plan included the topic, reasons for selecting it and an action plan on how to implement it. In the first phase of the project (2001-02), the national tripartite teams produced the following five national development projects: Estonia: Towards tackling youth unemployment through social dialogue . Hungary: Towards EMU and social convergence through social dialogue . Malta: Towards a culture of trust within the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development . Poland: Towards a social pact for the young through social dialogue . Slovenia: Towards EMU via a social agreement through social dialogue . 23 Overview 12 With the caveat that pay levels in the highest paid ACs (Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia) are above the lowest pay level in the EU 15 (Portugal). ",
        "In the course of the second phase of the project (2003), the national tripartite teams came up with the following national development projects: Cyprus: Towards EMU through social dialogue . Czech Republic: Strengthening social dialogue to support the reform of public finances . Latvia: Enhancement of social and economic development through strengthening the sectoral social dialogue . Lithuania: Development of collective labour relations and a wages regulation system . Slovakia: Towards EMU through solving unemployment . The selection of a joint project was not an easy task and the content varies from the direct EMU development projects tackling the Maastricht criteria to more \u2018indirect\u2019 projects such as those linked to employment policy issues. Some representatives stressed that their country\u2019s preparation for EMU alignment will become acute in four to five years\u2019 time and that was the reason for them to tackle the issue directly. In contrast, in other acceding countries, the social partners and government representatives realised that before they could use social dialogue as a tool for achieving the EMU criteria, they had to strengthen the national industrial relations mechanisms at various levels. A summary of the 10 national development plans are presented below in alphabetical order by country. CYPRUS: Towards EMU through social dialogue In the case of Cyprus, social dialogue can create the conditions for the achievement of the target of participation in EMU and adoption of the euro, the earliest possible after accession. The fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria is a necessary precondition for EMU and therefore the containment of fiscal deficit within the limit of 3% of GDP is imperative. For 2003, the fiscal deficit of Cyprus is estimated to be around 5% of GDP without any corrective measures. The relatively large share of the tourist sector in Cyprus to GDP unavoidably causes the Cyprus economy to be vulnerable to external shocks. In periods when an external shock takes place, the economic environment deteriorates and tourist arrivals are negatively affected, consequently leading to a reduction of growth rate, tax revenue and ultimately to the increase of fiscal deficit. Objectives of the project It is believed that the fulfilment of the criterion for fiscal deficit is a necessary precondition in order to improve macroeconomic stability in the economy. However, currently the fiscal deficit runs high and diverges from the corresponding Maastricht criterion. The reduction of the fiscal deficit will reduce inflationary pressures in the economy and therefore will help the economy to maintain the inflation rate at the core level without, at the same time, pushing interest rates up. Moreover, the containment of the fiscal deficit is expected to improve the investment climate in the economy, while total savings are also estimated to increase. 24 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "However, achieving a significant reduction of the fiscal deficit is not the only requirement. What is additionally needed is the reduction of the fiscal deficit to be grounded on a reasonable and feasible fiscal consolidation programme, which will lead to fiscal sustainability. The fulfilment of the criterion for the fiscal deficit is estimated to be accomplished by the end of 2004, based on the implementation of the Fiscal Consolidation Programme. The other Maastricht criteria, such as the inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate and public debt as a ratio to GDP, are to a great extent achieved. Actors responsible for implementation The implementation of the National Development Plan will be promoted through two existing tripartite bodies: the Labour Advisory Body, which is presided over by the Minister of Labour and Social Insurance, and the Economic Advisory Committee, which is presided over by the Minister of Finance. The Labour Advisory Body is the main tripartite body that deals with labour and social issues, and there is wide representation from all social partners. The same representation can be found within the Economic Advisory Committee, which deals with problems and issues pertaining to the Cyprus economy in general. The Central Bank of Cyprus also participates in the Economic Advisory Committee, a fact that will prove especially helpful since the project focuses on social dialogue and EMU. It is expected that once the National Development Plan is discussed at the abovementioned tripartite committees, they will assign the detailed work to joint tripartite technical committees, which will be jointly presided over by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labour. These tripartite technical committees will be responsible for reaching specific conclusions and recommendations as to how the fiscal deficit can be reduced so as to achieve convergence with the Maastricht criteria, with the ultimate goal of achieving fiscal macroeconomic sustainability. The members of the tripartite technical committees will be fully supported by specialists and personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. Members of the committees will also be supported by their own organisational infrastructures (personnel and research departments of the main employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organisations). Members of the project group The Cypriot tripartite group in Vienna in May 2003 was composed of: Government representatives: Orestios Messios and Michaela Papadopoulou Employer representatives: Michael Antoniou and Emilios Michael Trade union representatives: Andreas Pavlikkas and Andreas Poulis Ellias Mallis and Orestis Messios drafted the Cypriot report. CZECH REPUBLIC: Strengthening social dialogue to support the reform of public finances In the referendum of 13 and 14 June 2003, the Czechs voted in favour of the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the European Union. This outcome made the issue of the country\u2019s preparations for joining the EMU even more topical, particularily in a situation where the continuation of the hitherto unfavourable developments in public finances appears to be unsustainable from the point of view of the socio-economic future of the nation. It seems that most of the Czech society has no longer any doubts about the necessity of a fundamental change in the state\u2019s approach to public expenditure, in order to stop the growing internal debt, as well as to meet the Maastricht criteria. 25 Overview ",
        "In this context, the contest and the discussions surrounding the reform of public finances, and the scale and nature of the reform, are starting to grow and are gradually becoming a matter of concern to the whole of society. The government has already approved the budget targets that the reform is to induce. The public budgets deficit should gradually fall from this year\u2019s over 6% of gross domestic product to 4% of GDP in 2006. The government has also reached an agreement on questions concerning the concept and guiding principles of the reform measures and has approved of it. The concept of the reform lies in the application of a broad range of interconnected and strategically important changes, but changes which will be socially and politically difficult to push through. The highest economic expectations are linked to savings in mandatory (legislatively required) state budget expenditure concerning the social area first and foremost. The existing coalition government, which is the initiator and expected to be responsible for the implementation of the reform, is in a difficult position. On the one hand, it has already made it clear to the public that it will link its further existence to the successful implementation of the prepared reform. On the other hand, it faces political opposition, both from within its own ranks and among the opposition parties in parliament. A negative factor in the public expenditure reform is the current opposition coming from the social partners, particularly the trade unions, which has led to a growing wave of demonstrations and strikes. Social peace seems to be under a real threat at present. This is, of course, an entirely undesirable development, especially when we consider the hitherto positive attitude of the government towards social dialogue when tackling other strategic and legislative problems. In the opinion of the Czech representatives, however, in order for the reform to be approved by the majority of civil society and to succeed in the long term, the essential point is whether and to what extent the government can still use, and possibly even increase, the effectiveness of the existing structures of social dialogue at national level. This implies that the intended reform measures win and retain the support of the social partners represented in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement. In this context, we hark back to the significant, perhaps even crucial, role of tripartite consultations and social dialogue in maintaining social peace and in securing economic development during the past years of the transformation period. Objectives of the project The fundamental precondition for the successful public finance reform in the Czech Republic lies in generating a framework for consensus in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement. The Czech government will, of course, retain, and possibly even strengthen, its role as an instigator. For this to happen, the government will, first and foremost, have to make consistent and systematic use of this platform. However, this might not suffice for gaining stable support from the social partners in the tripartite arena. There have been findings, shared by the social partners, indicating that the national tripartite mechanisms in their current form have some shortcomings, limiting their effectiveness. 13 26 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 13 Cf. the conclusions of the recent Phare twinning project on \u2018Social dialogue in the Czech Republic\u2019, see Chapter 2 . ",
        "One of the weaknesses of the social dialogue system at national level is the fact that since its inception, the content and working procedures of the tripartite bodies were not, and still are not, regulated by law; the system is based on the principle of free will and agreement between the social partners and government. The lack of a binding legal framework opens up considerable space for the social dialogue system\u2019s potential dependency on the political regime. It is also marred by the absence of clearly defined goals for social dialogue at national level, owing to the fact that no general agreement, or any other social pact defining relevant economic and social tasks and the framework for macroeconomic and social development in the Czech Republic, has been concluded since the mid-1990s. Another shortcoming is that the ties between national tripartite dialogue and social dialogue at sectoral and enterprise level are not being strengthened and the possibility of asserting social dialogue at these levels through the national tripartite platform (e.g. by defining goals for wage development and employment and by concluding framework agreements steering the behaviour of the social partners at sectoral and enterprise level) is not being used. A final crucial problem of social dialogue at national level is linked to the issue of the representativeness of the social partners. This problem is intensified by the pressure to open up the trade union delegation to other trade union organisations. The application of representativeness criteria, especially the criterion of a minimum number of members, will ultimately lead to the exclusion of certain influential trade union confederations (e.g. the Confederation of Art and Culture). The main objective of the submitted plan, therefore, is to raise the question of tackling the two processes in parallel, i.e. strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the national tripartite platform and gaining the social partners\u2019 stable support for all components of the reform of public expenditure. The conclusion of a social pact between the government and social partners on the concept of the reform and the conditions for its support, covering at least the period from 2003 to 2006 in the first phase, should be regarded as an instrument to be used for steering the tripartite arena towards effective and stable support. Given the potentially serious political, social and economic consequences, including the preparation of the state budget and legislative bills for priority reform measures, the content of the reform must be finalised without delay and it is necessary to formulate, in collaboration with the social partners, the relevant document defining the future tripartite social pact. The submitted National Development Plan seeks to counteract recent developments seeking to implement public expenditure reforms against the will of the social partners, with the aim of achieving social consensus with the social partners on the reform while maintaining social peace during the reform process. Actors responsible for implementation In the same way as the government alone is not responsible for developments to date in connection with the preparation and adoption of public finance reform, with the social partners also sharing the burden of co-responsibility, all members of the Council of Economic and Social Agreement or the future signatories of the Social Pact are jointly responsible for the implementation of the National Development Plan. The national tripartite actors will have to supervise the implementation of the plan\u2019s proposed measures in line with the roles they play in this social dialogue platform. 27 Overview ",
        "Funding The implementation of the National Development Plan will not cause any costs of a material or financial nature and, therefore, will not require any material or financial resources. Members of the project group The Czech tripartite group in Vienna in May 2003 was composed of: Government representatives: Jaroslav Sulc and Ladislav Trylc Employer representatives: Vladimir\u00e1 Drbalov\u00e1 Trade union representatives: not present Jaroslav H\u00e1la, Ale \u2030 Kroupa, Jaroslav Kux, Zde \u00c0 ka Mansfeldov\u00e1 and Petra Raku \u2030 anov\u00e1 drafted the Czech report. ESTONIA: Towards tackling youth unemployment through social dialogue The decline in the employment rate and the rapid growth of unemployment accelerated after 1997, when the Estonian economy experienced severe setbacks. Risk groups in the Estonian labour market include young people in the 16-24 age group, disabled persons, the long-term unemployed, mothers with small children, job-seekers who have lost their qualifications, people at pre-pension age and non-nationals. Unemployment growth has been especially rapid among young people and the number of people who have been out of work for more than one year has risen. The unemployment rate among the youth has been rising and the risk of remaining unemployed after leaving school is also on the increase. In 2001, the unemployment rate among young people was recorded at 22.2%, the corresponding figure in the EU being 16.7%. In order to alleviate the problem, active and preventive employment measures are planned, the aims of which are to assist the youth in integrating into the labour market and enhance their capacity to adapt to a changing labour market. Objectives of the project (cid:2) To plan education needs, especially vocational education. The aim is to identify the needs of students at an earlier stage in order to forestall potential risks and overcome existing problems. The objective is to guarantee a qualified workforce which will match labour market demands. (cid:2) To develop and implement active measures for the integration of young people into the labour market in Ida-Virumaa, Southeast Estonia and islands, as part of the PHARE 2001 project on enhancing youth employment, \u2018Promoting the employment of youth\u2019. (cid:2) To carry out a study on \u2018Adaptation of the youth in the labour market and factors influencing this\u2019. The objective of the study is to analyse the adaptation capability of young people in the labour market, obtain an overview of the factors having an impact on professional success or failure, identify the issues for young people who have a higher risk of remaining unemployed and find ways to reduce unemployment among young people. As a result of the survey, recommendations for the implementation of labour market policy measures will be put forward in order to enhance the competitiveness of the youth labour market. (cid:2) To develop and pilot an employment measure/work practice with a view to assisting long-term unemployed people without special skills or work experience in finding employment (the proportion of young people among the long-term unemployed being very high). 28 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Actors responsible for implementation Action plans are being prepared in co-operation with the social partners and institutions responsible for the implementation of the programmes. These institutions comprise the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Labour Market Board, employment offices, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, local governments, social partners and non-profit organisations. Some projects (development of the vocational education system, active employment measures, etc) have already been operational for several years, while other pilot projects started in 2002. Funding Financing for the different projects comes from the following sources: national budget, bilateral co- operation projects, PHARE funding, and the Privatisation Reserve Fund (non-budget Government fund). Members of the project group The Estonian tripartite group in Vienna in May 2002 was composed of: Government representatives: Eike Hindov Employer representatives: Priidu Nomm Trade union representatives: Vaike Parkel and Hilje Ounapuu The Estonian national seminar in Tallinn on October 2002 was made up of 14 trade union and government-level representatives. The employer representatives were not able to participate. The draft proposal was sent to the employers for comments. Kaia Philips and Raoul Eamets drafted the Estonian report. Hilje Ounapuu presented the programme at the Danish Presidency Conference in Elsinore on \u2018Tripartism in an Enlarged EU\u2019 in October 2002. HUNGARY: Towards EMU and social convergence through social dialogue Social partners and the government share the view that joining the EU and EMU will have a major impact on the economic and social situation in Hungary. Taking into account the challenge of social convergence, the social partners and the state have produced an outline of the social partners\u2019 action programme in Hungary. Objectives of the project The main objective is to achieve real economic and social convergence. For this to happen, sustainable economic growth is needed. This can only be maintained through financial balance, which means that budget deficit, inflation and state debt should be kept at levels which make it possible to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in due course. Social partners and the government maintain that social convergence is equally important and this process should accompany that of economic convergence. The action programme should be implemented in three phases: 1. Up to the date of accession; 29 Overview ",
        "2. 2004-2006: Preparation for EMU (during this period preparations could be completed); 3. 2006-2007: Full-fledged participation in EMU. The social partners and the government are convinced it is important to implement the above objectives in order to maintain and develop the country\u2019s competitiveness, which is crucial both from the point of view of Hungary\u2019s export performance and of its stable and high economic growth. If this is achieved, sustainable development and social peace could be maintained, although the social partners feel that stable economic growth is a necessary, but not sufficient prerequisite for human development. Actors responsible for implementation The main actors are the social partners and the state (government, employers and trade unions) and there is a joint view that the civil society (citizens themselves and NGOs) should also take an active part in the process. The social partners and the government share the view that the action programme has to be implemented at central, regional and local levels, and it is important that between them (in the division of labour) a proper balance should be established. Funding For the National Development Plan in the first phase (i.e. up to 2004), national resources and pre- accession funds should be used; later (from 2004 onwards), national resources and EU funds will be used. Members of the project group The Hungarian tripartite group in Vienna in May 2002 was composed of: Government representatives: Maria Lado and Zoltan Varga Employer representatives: Antal Szabadkai and Laszlone Szili Trade union representatives: Barbara Kerek and Erzebet Hanti The Hungarian national seminar in Budapest in October 2002 was made up of 35 high-level tripartite representatives. Klara Foti drafted the Hungarian report. Erzbet Hanti presented the programme at the Danish Presidency Conference in Elsinore on \u2018Tripartism in an Enlarged EU\u2019 in October 2002. LATVIA: Enhancement of social and economic development through strengthening the sectoral social dialogue At the Vienna workshop, the Latvian representatives of the social partners agreed that what is needed in Latvia, given its particular situation with regard to underdeveloped social dialogue at sectoral level, is the \u2018enhancement of social and economic development by means of strengthening sectoral social dialogue\u2019. 30 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Objectives of the project \u2018One size does not fit all\u2019. Currently, Latvian social dialogue primarily takes place at company level. The social partners\u2019 organisations at national level are relatively strong. Thus, the weak point in the Latvian industrial relations system is at the sectoral level. This level should be addressed to foster the social and economic convergence process paving the way for Latvia\u2019s future EMU membership. The time frame for the implementation of the National Development Plan is 2003-2007. The implementation itself would take place in two phases: 1. 2003-2005: Strengthening of sectoral social partners\u2019 organisations. This would comprise the following: \u2013 consolidation; \u2013 elaboration of position papers and programmes; \u2013 communication with the members; and \u2013 gaining the support of the members. 2. 2005-2007: Negotiations between the social partners at sectoral level. By the end of this period, there should be sufficiently strong and skilled social partners at sectoral level, capable of engaging in an ongoing dialogue. Actors responsible for implementation The national social partners\u2019 organisations will provide an impetus to the sectoral-level organisations, who would then take over responsibility for the successful implementation of the National Development Plan. At national level, the actors responsible for implementation would be the current national social partners (Latvian Employers\u2019 Confederation or LDDK 14 and the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia or LBAS), as well as their sectoral-level organisations. Funding Prior to accession, national resources as well as pre-accession funds will be the main form of funding; after accession, EU funds could replace the pre-accession funds as the main financial resource. Members of the project group The Latvian tripartite group in Vienna in May 2003 was composed of: Government representatives: Ineta Tare and Ineta Vjakse Employer representatives: Jeva Jaunzeme and Daiga Ermsone Trade union representatives: Rita Pfeifere and Ojars Braze Gita Feldhune drafted the Latvian report. LITHUANIA: Development of collective labour relations and a wages regulation system Both the political situation in Lithuania and the industrial relations system are preconditions for a positive development of the social dialogue. In practice, however, co-operation between employers 31 Overview 14 See http://www.ldkonfederacija.lt/n/lvdk.middle.m_news_out_form.140.381a0ea7a089744db61ec26b6cf369fd.php ",
        "and employees has not reached sufficient effectiveness yet, though it will become of growing importance, due to the fact that the New Labour Code is dealing with the regulation of work relations under collective agreements. Social dialogue in Lithuania has to assume the same role as in the other acceding countries. In order for this to happen, the social partners have to \u2018get their act together\u2019 and transform the statutory regulations into real industrial relations practice at the national, regional and local levels. Furthermore, it is important to promote the development of social dialogue using not only administrative means but also economic means. The tradition of social dialogue started in Lithuania in 1990 and it should be emphasised that progress has been significant ever since (especially after 2000). Collective agreements, for example, are promoted by the New Labour Code. An atmosphere fostering the conclusion of collective agreements increases the interdependency and trust relationship between the social partners. As highlighted in the national report, economic growth in Lithuania is not in step with the social development of the country. A well-functioning social dialogue, therefore, should enable the social partners to prepare an effective wages growth model, as well as to secure the linkage between economic and social development. It is necessary to ensure that economic growth serves the entire society, not only a small proportion of it. On the other hand, the growth of wages should depend not only on subjective factors (relations between employer and employee), but also on objective factors \u2014 being the result of production and the general macroeconomic situation. Objectives of the project Social stratification is widely proliferating in Lithuania. Insufficient income level regulations, as well as limited possibilities of the social support system, increase the number of poor families, especially in rural areas. The annual increase of average wages as well as the minimum monthly wage are insufficient. 15 The number of disabled and elderly people in employment decreased substantially between 1998 and 2003 in Lithuania. The present tax policy does not encourage employers to offer internships to young students. There are no measures to support their first-job placement. The taxation of the labour force in Lithuania is one of the highest in Europe, therefore the social partners could exert presssure on the government to change the tax policy. The project will be undertaken in a \u2018step by step\u2019 approach: 1. to prepare, in co-operation with the social partners, a strongly motivated and adopted programme document (end of 2003 \u2013 beginning of 2004); 2. to conduct research and surveys on the cooperation of the social partners in possible future developments (2004-2006 and onwards); 3. to prepare and adopt legislation (2004-2005); and 4. to systematically train the social partners. The training institutes of the social partners do not have sufficient capacities, especially in the regions where the development of industrial infrastructure is not very high. Therefore, effective and efficient training and development of 32 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 15 The minimum wage was e 125 per month in January 2003, according to Eurostat, Statistics in focus, theme 3 , No.10/2003, p. 2. ",
        "human resources could be one of the most effective measures in developing and strengthening the social dialogue in Lithuania. Actors responsible for implementation Actors responsible for the project\u2019s implementation will be the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania and, in particular, the Tripartite Commission of Wages. Historically, wage formulation is one of the major objects of social dialogue. Therefore, it would be useful to pay particular attention to the regulation of this industrial relations element. It should be mentioned that during the period 2000-2003, the role of the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania has grown considerably. Therefore, we can expect that the role of this institution will be as important in the future, with a potentially increased influence upon governmental decisions. The other alternative is the Ministry of Social Security and Labour. However, given that it is one of the tripartite partners, the delegation of all responsibilities to only this institution would be inefficient and distort the principle of social co-operation on an equal basis. Nevertheless, considering today\u2019s conditions, the specialists of the Ministry of Social Security and Labour should encourage and initiate the development of social dialogue and collective agreements in Lithuania. Funding Financial resources should be considered from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, International Labour Organisation, EU funds, national budget (budgets of municipalities), Lithuanian Employment Fund and the financial resources of the social partners. It should be stressed that the development of social partnership does not have sufficient support from financial resources at national level. Therefore, on the one hand, the Lithuanian social partners should co-operate more actively with foreign partners and international organisations, and, on the other hand, they should seek to raise national resources. As for the development of human resources, working groups consisting of representatives of the social partners and academics should be constituted in order to prepare the conception and submission of particular proposals. This would enable the social partners to work more professionally and to rationalise work processes, as well as to simplify procedures of arriving at agreements. Furthermore, these integrated groups would be more flexible and the draft proposals would correspond to a larger extent to the interests of all the social partners. It is also important to mention the necessity of further strenghtening the relationship between the social partners and the scientific community. The social partners in Lithuania are not yet equipped with research centres of their own and thus the proposals they submit do not always have a sound and sufficient theoretical and analytical basis. Members of the project group The Lithuanian tripartite group in Vienna in May 2003 was composed of: Government representatives: Ramune Guobaite and Mindaugas Kuraitis Employer representatives: Jonas Bloze and Justina Vitkauskaite Trade union representatives: Grazina Gruzdiene and Robertas Mileris Boguslavas Gruzevskis and Inga Blaziene drafted the Lithuanian report. 33 Overview ",
        "MALTA: Towards a culture of trust within the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development According to Maltese law, Cap. 431 states: \u2018The Malta Council for Economic and Social Development is hereby established as an advisory body in order to provide a forum for consultation and social dialogue between social partners and, where necessary, with organisations of civil society, and is entrusted with the task of advising government on issues relating to the sustainable economic and social development of Malta.\u2019 What follows are the conclusions reached as a result of a one-day national workshop in Malta at the end of the first phase of the project. Participants at this workshop included high-level representatives of the major trade unions, employers\u2019 associations, government departments dealing with women\u2019s issues, social security, employment and industrial relations, as well as other labour market bodies and representatives of the academic community. The aim of the workshop was to contribute towards a draft National Development Plan for Malta, based on current social and economic realities. This plan would take into account the economic challenges as well as those arising from prospective conformity to EMU, noting that these are likely to result in some upheaval in employment and industrial relations in Malta. The draft plan calls for a \u2018renewed positive commitment to tripartite, social partnership\u2019. While noting the existence of the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD), it also refers to the difficulties faced by this institution for tripartite dialogue in harmonising formal and informal industrial relations. The plan emphasises the need for specific action to bring about this renewal of social partnership. Participants entered into a lively debate on the obstacles encountered in social dialogue in Malta, in itself and in the run-up to possible EMU convergence. Representatives affirmed that much bipartite negotiation is in fact very successful and that it is usually only the rare problematic cases that catch media attention. Notwithstanding, it was generally agreed that there remains room for development and various problems were highlighted by participants. These include a \u2018trust deficit\u2019 among the social partners due to the tendency for defensive posturing and the occasional failure of one party or another to honour commitments. A second obstacle is the general failure in will or ability to prioritise the national interest, since negotiating parties often take a narrow and partisan approach. A third obstacle is the often ambiguous role of the government in tripartite negotiations \u2014 being both the largest employer in Malta as well as the policy-maker and regulator. A further problem is the deficit in a range of skills necessary for effective dialogue and negotiation. The fifth and final obstacle is the tendency for successive administrations to simply create another institution every time a stalemate is reached, rather than addressing problems and making existing institutions work. There appeared to be general consensus across the board on the need to address these issues through some sort of trust-building mechanism. Participants were then asked to reflect on the four questions which had been articulated by them earlier on. The first question dealt with whether Malta needed to create an institution to strengthen social dialogue that is separate from the current Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD). The MCESD exists in law and is governed by a tripartite executive board, though funded by the government. The general consensus among participants was that a separate institution is not needed, but that the MCESD does require significant reform if it is to function effectively. The second question concerned whether or not to 34 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "include government, as policy-maker and/or employer, in any new or revised social dialogue initiative. Most of the participants took the view that dialogue should occur at bipartite level (where government was not strictly necessary, except perhaps as employer), while negotiation should occur at tripartite level (where government should be involved). The third question was whether or not to include civil society. Responses to this were more diverse. While most participants believed that civil society should be included, there were differences in opinion as to how people should be selected and on the scope and level of their involvement. The fourth and last question was whether this \u2018trust-building mechanism\u2019 should be EU-neutral or take a position on EU membership. Again, opinions were divided. On the one side were those who asserted that, given the centrality of Malta\u2019s application and the prospective impact of conformity to Maastricht requirements, EU membership should be a central theme on the agenda. Others asserted that given Malta\u2019s polarised opinion on membership, doing so might compromise the trust-building exercise. Yet others stated that Malta must conduct these economic reforms whether or not it joins the EU. Objectives of the project At the end of the seminar, there appeared to be a consensual view of the way forward. This has three main components. First, that tripartite negotiations currently occurring at MCESD are to be strengthened and better resourced; consultees are to be given enough time to analyse documents and proposals comprehensively; and commitments made are to be honoured by all parties. Second, that MCESD also provide a forum for bipartite dialogue. Third, that a supportive framework for social dialogue be created. This would involve a number of functions, inter alia, the systematic monitoring and evaluating of the practice of bi- and tripartite social dialogue in Malta; conducting research; capacity building among stakeholders; educating the public; and enabling civil society to associate and represent itself. It was agreed that all stakeholders have something to contribute to this \u2018trust-building\u2019 endeavour; in fact, not all these functions can be carried out by one single body. Actors responsible for implementation Key stakeholders are the MCESD itself and the various social partners. Other actors include the Office of the Prime Minister as the person responsible for the MCESD; the University; the Department for Employment and Industrial Relations; Parliament; the Employment and Training Corporation; the Department for Women in Society; and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Participants agreed that the next step in this project would be the development of a matrix of the various contributions that stakeholders could make to this \u2018trust-building\u2019 project. Members of the project group The Malta tripartite group in Vienna in May 2002 was composed of: Government representatives: Frank Pullicino and Elaine Bonello Employer representatives: John B. Scicluna and Josef Delia Trade union representatives: Mario Cutajar and Romina Bartolo The Malta national seminar in Valetta in October 2002 was made up of 30 high-level tripartite representatives. 35 Overview ",

POLAND: Towards a social pact for the young through social dialogue Poland has been a stable political country for the last three years, but the economic situation is more problematic. Social partners agree that the main social problems are high unemployment (up to 18%), particularly among the young (up to 40%), and high public deficit (6%). The population of 20-year-olds totalled over 690,000 in 2001 and 700,000 in 2002, and it will be 720,000 in 2003 and 690,000 in 2004. A considerable number of this age group are still studying at universities or other schools. The educational coefficient of the tertiary education level amounted to 40.7% in the year 2000. In Poland, union density represents 14-18% of the working population. The state plays the leading role in social dialogue. Collective agreements take place mainly at company or local level. The social partners and the state take the view that employment issues should be discussed jointly at state level and also at regional and local levels in order to maintain jobs and fight against youth unemployment. The social partners and the state share the view that working together and focusing on youth unemployment will require that old, fixed and locked arguments be abandoned, at present the subject of a conflict of a symbolic nature. Objectives of the project The social partners jointly believe in the importance of the programme, which would create jobs for young people. As each side possesses some resources, they can support this programme in different ways. With regard to the concept, it is based on the standards formulated in the Amsterdam Treaty. A \u2018social pact for the young\u2019 is needed in the sphere of employment and job creation. The manner in which it will be developed and negotiated by the social partners will offer a basis for setting in motion complex activities aimed at greater social mobilisation of the young. The programme comprises four pillars of action: 1. a component aimed at creating jobs for graduates; 2. a component aimed at developing occupational training for graduates; 3. a component aimed at creating places of work where young people can get involved in self- employment; and 4. a component aimed at developing the labour market infrastructure. Necessary actions will include: (cid:2) Holding a national seminar with a broad participation by the social partners on the topic of EMU, its goals and ways in which the Polish economy can come closer to the principles of stable development included in this policy. The seminar would show that the \u2018Pact for the young\u2019 programme can be an element of support to stable economic development, by mobilising 36 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "the most valuable resources, such as the skilled young labour force and a more authentic social dialogue. It would involve critical discussion of Poland\u2019s preparations to join EMU and the Eurozone, and a debate around whether the idea currently being implemented in Ireland (of devoting an additional 1% of taxes to unemployed youth) is worthy of consideration. (cid:2) Negotiations relating to the possible input of social partners in the establishment of numerous Youth Job Clubs (YJC) and Youth Entrepreneurship Centres (YEC). (cid:2) Founding local advisory bodies comprised of social partner representatives who would develop concepts of co-operation between the YJC and YEC in a given area. (cid:2) Determining the input of interested social partners in the functioning of the YJC and YEC. (cid:2) Training voluntary workers and professional staff regarding these actions. (cid:2) Promoting the idea of the Pact in vocational as well as higher education-level schools, in order to reach young people before they leave school. (cid:2) Commencing with the implementation of the programme \u2018Pact for the young\u2019. Actors responsible for implementation The \u2018Social pact for the young\u2019 calls for negotiations at different levels of social dialogue. As an initiative, it calls for dialogue at state level because the government will be a serious participant in formulating the principles and financing the programme. The government needs, in particular, to make estimates concerning the long-term benefits of the pact. Social dialogue at the level of voivodship (highest level of administration unit) could become strengthened by the initiative already being taken at the lower level. Additional actions within the framework of a programme call for negotiations between trade union and employer associations, which have the human resources and expertise on how the labour market functions or how to run a company. By combining this stockpile into one body which remains at the disposal of the government, territorial administration, trade unions, employer unions and the non-governmental sector, a synergy effect will be produced to create a place where the young person can receive support, in the wide sense of the word, for his or her professional stability.

        "SLOVAKIA: Towards EMU through solving unemployment The representatives of the trade unions, employers\u2019 associations and the researchers, who represented Slovakia at the tripartite workshop, agreed on the choice of National Development Plan, aimed at combatting unemployment and facilitating compliance with the Maastricht criteria. Of all the participating acceding countries at the workshop, Slovakia was the only country whose government representatives were absent. If the development project is to be beneficial to Slovakia, the representatives of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family should therefore come on board in order to assure a timely and adequate implementation of the project. The social partners, as represented by the participants to the Vienna II workshop, are, according to the natural logic of tripartite bargaining, prepared to address and discuss this National Development Plan with government representatives, who by mid-September 2003 had not expressed their opinion yet. Social partners and researchers are also prepared to amend the content of the project and even, if necessary, to accept by mutual accord a completely new project that would be acceptable to all the tripartite partners. The participants of the seminar are fully aware of the importance of such a project for both the development of a new phase of industrial relations and the socio-economic development of Slovakia, which will certainly face hard times during the period of preparing the country for the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria. Objectives of the project The choice of the development project was influenced by the fact that long-term unemployment in Slovakia is amongst the highest in the acceding countries. Pressure to resolve unemployment derives from both the existing development of the unemployment rate and from correlated policies that have been used by successive governments to combat unemployment. The government that came into power after the general elections of 1998 fixed in its programme the target of lowering the unemployment rate to under 11%. During its election term, the government decided that each governmental decision influencing the economy should take into account its impact on unemployment. In spite of this effort, at the end of the Autumn 2002 term, the government was not successful in decreasing unemployment; on the contrary, the unemployment rate increased to 18.7% (according to the Labour Force Surveys). All of this is ample evidence of the problems Slovakia is facing with regard to unemployment. After 1999, the government passed legislative bills to tighten the requirements for registration with the labour offices. In the following years, these more rigorous conditions increased the number of registered unemployed persons and, consequently, the unemployment rate. Slovakia needs real employment growth and new jobs. In the future, the evaluation of employment policies should not be based on administrative measures, but should be benchmarked against the Lisbon strategy criteria. As it is evident, the National Development Plan of the social partners in Slovakia has also to include an agreement of the social partners about targets for the socio- economic development and methods of its evaluation. At present, the social dialogue in Slovakia is endangered because of the diametrically opposed requirements of the social partners. In particular, the issue of minimum wages divides the government and trade unions. This problem recurs each year at the moment when the minimum wage are adapted because of inflation. On the one hand, the government tries to advocate low 38 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "39 Overview minimum wages as one of the measures laying the ground for new jobs. On the other hand, the trade unions demand higher wages as a sufficient incentive to enter the labour market. Within the framework of the National Development Plan, a comprehensive list of measures should be elaborated that would be centred on support for the creation of new jobs. The project should incorporate both measures for an active labour policy and the means of achieving financial and budgetary stability as preconditions for the next stages of the development project. In addition, the governmental plans to reform the pension system, supposed to be linked to performance-related aspects, should become an integral part of the project. The project is scheduled to start in Autumn 2003 and last until the end of the election term of the present government, i.e. September 2006 when the next general elections should take place. Taking into account the complicated and strategic character of decisions that will lead to higher employment, the National Development Plan should be tackled at the highest tripartite level, i.e. by the Council for Economic and Social Concertation (RHSD). The two objectives of the project \u2014 continuous social dialogue (main objective) and governmental measures to combat unemployment (instrumental objective) \u2014 should be kept apart and yet are inseparable from each other. The instrumental objective would be fulfilled by preparing a set of measures targeted at increasing the number of jobs in the Slovak economy by the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, Ministry of Finance, National Labour Office and Counties (eight higher regional units), and then by bringing these measures into effect after discussion at the RHSD. Apart from the strategic decisions (included in the National Development Plan), the measures of the instrumental objective should be decided at the highest tripartite level (at RHSD). They should be supplemented and supported by partial development projects at sectoral level (Sectoral development projects). The choice of sectors would be made according to the proposals of the social partners and following the decision at the RHSD. It is evident that the trade unions will need support both at the national and sectoral level from independent organisations and external experts (research institutes, universities, etc.) in order to fullfil their mandate. During the whole pre-accession period to EMU, the preconditions for continuous social dialogue should be created. During the whole project, the mutual trust relationship between the social partners should be based on knowing the long-term objectives of all the partners in view of fulfiling the EMU criteria. The first step of the project would lie in the creation of a list of preferences of the social partners, which would, at the same time, serve as the initial record of the development project. Actors responsible for implementation All the social partners should participate in the preparation of the National Development Plan and via the Council for Economic and Social Concertation (RHSD) all the tripartite partners should be responsible for the implementation of the project. ",
        "Funding The government should earmark the financial resources stemming from the national budget for this project. Apart from this, the project could be co-financed by additional resources from the EU (structural funds). Members of the project group The Slovakian bipartite group in Vienna in May 2003 was composed of: Government representatives: not present Employer representatives: Vladimir Kalina Trade union representatives: Milo \u2030 Krssak Ludovit Cziria and Jan Kosta drafted the Slovakian report. SLOVENIA: Towards EMU via a social agreement through social dialogue The social partners in Slovenia are aware of the fact that accession to the EU and particularly to EMU signifies both a challenge for achieving better economic performance and a possible risk to the level of social security and overall standard of living of the Slovene people. They realise that successful accession will depend on the contribution to the process made by all actors, namely employees, employers and the government, who must for this reason further enhance their mutual co-operation. Preparing for accession is only one reason why the Slovene social partners have started to negotiate a social agreement with the aim of ensuring a stable economic development and progress in conditions of social peace. They have set as their principal goal the achievement of a sustainable economic and social development. Objectives of the project The social partners agree that the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy should be based on higher labour productivity, increased knowledge, more investment in human resources development, high levels of employment, fair pay for workers and greater emphasis on occupational health and safety. That is why in the social agreement the social partners are trying to reach consensus on the following issues: 1. Wages policy : The social partners agree that wages policy should function as an incentive for workers, and at the same time should not jeopardise further investment in development. At national level in Slovenia, the aim in the years to come will be to achieve a pace of wages growth that will be behind labour productivity growth by 1%. At the same time, the aim is to: (cid:2) rationalise wages policy in the public sector; (cid:2) maintain purchasing power at current levels; and (cid:2) increase the link between pay and performance. 2. Increasing employment : The social partners agree that increasing employment levels must be a priority among all three partners, since the programmes that can be financed from public funds are not sufficient to eliminate unemployment. Through active employment programmes organised at national level, and additionally through raising awareness of the need for lifelong learning and investment in development and employee training, among both employers and employees, it will be possible to secure greater growth in employment and increase the employability of individuals. The priority tasks are therefore: 40 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "(cid:2) to educate the workforce, both unemployed and employed; and (cid:2) to promote lifelong learning. 3. Maintaining the achieved level of social security : The partners agree that an active social policy is the appropriate approach to dealing with this problem. They will therefore strive to fulfil the adopted guidelines and implement the widely agreed national social policy, which is orientated towards encouraging and supporting assistance for those who need it, so that to the greatest possible extent they can become actively involved in supporting themselves. 4. Increasing concern for occupational safety and health : The social partners in Slovenia understand the importance of concern for the safety and health of employees and, in the proposed social agreement, they pay special attention to this area. 5. Improving legal security for employees : This is a priority despite the fact that in Slovenia the basic legal conditions already in existence, which enable the implementation and overseeing of such legislation, have to a large extent already secured some improvement in the functioning of the system. The social partners will contribute towards improving the situation in this area by encouraging their members to change their relations in the immediate workplace and to raise the level of social dialogue at enterprise level. Members of the project group The Slovenian tripartite group in Vienna in May 2002 was composed of: Government representatives: Metka Stoka-Debevec Employer representatives: Metka Penko-Natlacen and Zvone Gosar Trade union representatives: Metka Roksandic The Slovenian national seminar in Ljubljana in October 2002 was made up of 35 high-level tripartite representatives. Miroslav Stanojevic drafted the Slovenian report. Metka Stoka-Debevec presented the programme at the Danish Presidency Conference on \u2018Tripartism in an Enlarged EU\u2019 in Elsinore in October 2002. Implementation of the Phase 1 national development plans for Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovenia (as of September 2003) A year after the Vienna I workshop in 2002, the project management assessed the implementation of the first five national development plans via the national co-ordinators. An initial interim assessment of the impact of the projects in Estonia, Hungary, Malta and Slovenia came to the following conclusions. Estonia On 18 January 2002, the Estonian Employers\u2019 Confederation, the Estonian Confederation of Trade Unions and the government of the Republic signed a labour market policy agreement for 2002. The objective of the agreement was to include different labour market parties in solving employment and unemployment related problems. The agreement specifies the measures to be implemented by and expenditures of all three parties for 2002 to solve the aforementioned problems. The measures 41 Overview ",
        "implemented on the initiative of the government are mostly financed from the state budget but, if necessary, it is possible to apply for additional financing from the Privatisation Reserve Fund of the Government of the Republic. The tripartite co-operation advances the development of tripartite employment councils. In cases of lay-offs, more attention is to be paid to the preparation of social plans and principles for functioning and financing of additional and re-training will be elaborated. The Estonian Employers\u2019 Confederation and the Estonian Confederation of Trade Unions will, pursuant to the agreement, actively participate in the preparation of the Employment Action Plan for 2003 and will initiate additional employment projects. However, an agreement outlining the obligations of the three parties is planned to be prepared for 2003, and in the long term the parties find it necessary that joint labour market policy targets and trends, covering several years, prescribed in agreements should be concluded following the European social model. In the future, it is necessary to pay more attention to the bipartite social dialogue at the enterprise and sectoral level in order to increase the importance of collective agreements and make work organisation more flexible. A decrease in the employment rate and the rapid growth of unemployment accelerated after 1997, when the Estonian economy experienced severe setbacks. Risk groups in the Estonian labour market are defined as comprising young people in the 16-24 age group, the disabled, the long-term unemployed, mothers with small children, job-seekers who have lost their qualifications, people at pre-pension age and non-Estonians. Unemployment growth has been especially rapid among young people and the number of people who have been out of work for more than one year has risen. The unemployment rate among the youth has been rising and the danger of remaining unemployed after finishing school is increasing. In 2001, the unemployment rate of the young was recorded at 22.2%, the corresponding figure in the EU being 16.7%. In order to alleviate the seriousness of the problem, an increase in the share of active and preventive employment measures is planned, the aim of which is to assist young people in integrating into the labour market and to enhance their adaptive capacity. A primary target is to assist the long-term unemployed without special skills or work experience (the percentage of young people among the long-term unemployed is very high) in finding employment, a new employment measure or work practice. Action plans are prepared in co-operation with social partners and institutions responsible for the implementation of the programmes. These institutions are the Ministry of Social Affairs, Labour Market Board, Employment offices, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Economic Affairs, local governments, social partners and non-profit organisations. In a briefing with the Estonian Minister of Social Affairs, Mr Pomerants, and the Estonian social partners on the 16 June 2003, the project managers of the Foundation took stock of the implementation of the Estonian development project ( see http://hot.ee/iloestonia/pohisisu/ Opikoda_tekst.htm). In the course of the discussion, the Estonian government, as well as the social partners, voiced their deep satisfaction with the project and the impact it had on the national social pact. 42 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The tripartite delegation at the implementation workshop assessing the development project consisted of representatives from Employers (Eve P\u00e4\u00e4rendson, Estonian Employers\u2019 Confederation); Trade unions (Ago Tullig, Vaike Parkel and Harri Taliga); and Government (Minister Marko Pomerants, Piret Lillev\u00e4li, Karin Hanga, Malle Kundel and Tiit Kaadu). The delegation stressed, in particular, the following positive impacts of the project: (cid:2) The employers congratulated the Foundation, the national Estonian researchers (Kaia Philips and Raoul Eamets) and the Vienna Group on the excellent quality of the national report: it was well prepared, consisted of enlightening comparative details for the five acceding countries\u2019 studies and also had educational aspects. The Estonian Employers\u2019 Confederation now considers social dialogue as an important tool for the management of society, supplementing the processes of mere collective bargaining. The employer representative also confirmed the importance of the development project \u2018Tackling youth unemployment via social dialogue\u2019, which was recently integrated into the national development plan of Estonia. Youth unemployment remained an important issue in Estonia and was considered by the employers as one of the most problematic economic and societal tasks to be tackled. The quality of enlargement depended to a great extent on the involvement of the social partners, also in the framework of social dialogue, having to implement the social acquis communautaire. (cid:2) The trade union representatives acknowledged the success and importance of the project. Not only, but also thanks to the Foundation project, all the Estonian partners now understood what social dialogue is all about: this had not been the case only three years ago. Social dialogue, not only collective bargaining, was to be considered as one of the cornerstones of the European social model. Estonia only had a short history of tripartite agreements. In the last 10 years, 15 of these agreements were signed. Collective bargaining, of course, was also very important from a trade union perspective. This happened in Estonia mainly at enterprise level; very few collective agreements were signed at sectoral level and those agreements in place were, unfortunately, of an extremely bad coverage. In a nutshell, the trade unions praised the timeliness and usefulness of the Foundation project. (cid:2) The official of the Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs stressed that the Ministry had supported the project from the outset because it linked the issues of EMU and social dialogue. In contrast to what many Estonians thought, the \u2018E\u2019 of EMU stood for \u2018economic\u2019 (and not \u2018European\u2019), entailing that EMU convergence had to be put into a wider context: economic, social and monetary issues had to be reconciled. Two years ago, this was not an issue of discussion within the social partners\u2019 organisations and the Foundation project helped to foster this debate. It also promoted the idea of social dialogue in Estonia, on the subject of which, even last year, there were many misunderstandings. In the eyes of the Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs, the project helped to consolidate social dialogue in Estonia, which was essential if the country was to meet the new demands coming from the EU after accession. After this discussion, the social partners formally handed over the report to the Minister of Social Affairs. Hungary At the tripartite national seminar (Budapest, November 2002), the participants agreed that it was timely and useful to start a discussion at national level on the role that social dialogue, and especially tripartite negotiation, could play in the preparation for joining EMU. They also 43 Overview ",
        "addressed the benefits a national tripartite agreement could offer as an instrument for introducing the euro. In late autumn 2002, a committee was set up at government level to discuss the best timing for Hungary to join EMU. The members of the committee included some of the key parties, i.e. the government ministries concerned, the Hungarian National Bank and representatives of financial and academic circles. After several months of intensive debate, on 16 July 2003, a target day (1 January 2008) was jointly announced by the Hungarian government and the Hungarian National Bank for the introduction of the euro in Hungary. The mere existence of a set date presumes a timetable for the implementation of the necessary measures in the Hungarian economy that will allow the country to meet the Maastricht criteria by the time it joins EMU. The main challenge for Hungary remains the fulfilment of the Maastricht convergence criteria with respect to controlling the rate of inflation and remaining within the authorised 3% of the GDP for the budget deficit. Even if the rate of inflation has significantly decreased over the past few years, in 2002 the budget deficit was still around 9% in comparison with the GDP. In order to reduce the budget deficit, the government has taken steps that have the objective of increasing its revenues. At present, the Ministry of Finance budget deficit forecast for the years 2004-06 is 3.8%, 2.8% and 2.5% respectively. At the same time, the Monetary Council (Hungarian National Bank) has pointed out that Hungary cannot avoid, in the long term, the necessity of implementing measures that foresee a decrease in budget expenses. An unavoidable measure, many experts argue, in order to cut the current rate of budget deficit. Based on the experience of countries that have already joined EMU, it has been observed by the same Monetary Council that a mid-term social agreement will also facilitate the adaptation process in Hungary. Many experts welcome the idea of working towards an agreement that goes close to the objective of reaching balance between the wage pressures towards the level of current EU members and the necessity of preserving Hungary\u2019s economic competitiveness. They consider it as an important step in the right direction. However, so far the preparations for negotiating such an agreement have not yet been included on the immediate formal agenda of the Hungarian industrial relations system, neither at national nor at sectoral level. It thus seems vital that priority is given to putting the idea of a social agreement on the negotiating table in the near future. Malta Malta was one of the small group of EU accession countries where the Foundation carried out the pilot research project on EMU and social dialogue (Baldacchino , 2000). The aim was to draft a national development plan in preparation for Malta\u2019s adoption of the EMU criteria. The draft plan takes into account the current economic, political and social realities and notes that the prospective conformity to EMU is likely to cause a degree of upheaval in employment and industrial relations. In order to meet these challenges effectively under these circumstances, it is important to bring together and secure the collaboration of all the social partners. The plan, therefore, calls for a \u2018renewed, positive commitment to tripartite, social partnership\u2019 at both the national and local enterprise levels. 44 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "According to Maltese law (Cap. 431), \u2018The Malta Council for economic and social development is hereby established as an advisory body in order to provide a forum for consultation and social dialogue between social partners and, where necessary, with organisations of civil society, and is entrusted with the task of advising government on issues relating to the sustainable economic and social development of Malta\u2019. While noting the existence of the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD), the Plan also refers to the difficulties faced by this institution of tripartite dialogue in harmonising formal and informal industrial relations. The plan emphasises the need for specific action to bring about this renewal of social partnership. Simultaneously, it is known that much bipartite negotiation is in fact carried out successfully at the local enterprise level. It is usually only the rare problematic cases that catch media attention. Notwithstanding, it is generally agreed that there remains room for development, particularly in public sector negotiations. The problems which need to be tackled include a \u2018trust deficit\u2019 among social partners. This is due to a tendency for defensive posturing and the occasional failure of one party or another to honour commitments. A second key obstacle is a general inability to prioritise the national interest, as negotiating parties take a narrow and partisan approach. Third, there is the often ambiguous role of government in tripartite negotiation (it is the largest employer in Malta, as well as the policy- maker and regulator). Fourth, there is the deficit in the range of skills necessary for effective dialogue and negotiation. Finally, there is the tendency of successive administrations to simply set up yet another institution every time a stalemate is reached, rather than addressing problems and making institutions work. In the course of the pilot project, a one-day seminar was organised in Malta for an influential group of social partners and policy-makers. Participants were asked to propose answers to questions dealing with the above issues. The first question dealt with whether Malta needed to create a new institution to strengthen social dialogue and possibly replace the current MCESD. Though funded by government, the MCESD is governed by a tripartite executive board. The general consensus among participants is that a separate institution is not needed, but the MCESD does require significant reform if it is to function effectively. The second question concerned whether or not to include government (as policy-maker and/or employer) in any new/revised social dialogue initiative. Most of the participants suggested that when dialogue occurs at bipartite level, the presence of government is not strictly necessary except perhaps as employer; when negotiation occurs at the national, tripartite level, government should definitely be involved. The third question was whether or not to include civil society. Responses to this were more diverse: while most participants believed that civil society should be included, there were differences of opinion as to how people should be selected and on the scope and level of their involvement. By the end of the seminar there appeared to be a consensual view of the way forward. This has three main components. First, that tripartite negotiations currently occurring at MCESD are to be strengthened and better resourced; consultees are to be given enough time to analyse documents and proposals comprehensively and commitments made are to be honoured by all parties. Second, that MCESD should also provide a forum for bipartite dialogue. Third, that a supportive framework for social dialogue be created. This would involve a number of functions, inter alia, the systematic monitoring and evaluating of the practice of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue in Malta; 45 Overview ",
        "conducting research; capacity building among stakeholders; educating the public; and enabling civil society to associate and represent itself. It was agreed that all stakeholders have something to contribute to this \u2018trust-building\u2019 exercise; in fact, not all these functions can be carried out by one single body. Key stakeholders would include the MCESD itself and the various social partners; the Office of the Prime Minister as responsible for MCESD; the University; the Department for Employment and Industrial Relations; Parliament; the Employment and Training Corporation; the Department for Women in Society; and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Now that the burning issue of Malta\u2019s EU membership has been finally settled through the referendum and national election, the time is ripe to embark on the implementation stage of the national development plan. It is generally agreed that the next step in this project is the development of a matrix of the various contributions that stakeholders shall make to this \u2018trust building\u2019 project. In the meantime, training programmes are being planned, on the basis of research, aimed at bringing about the necessary cultural change in the Council and among its members. There is now a better opportunity than ever to achieve a general consensus on the need to address the above issues through some sort of trust-building mechanism. On 25 September 2003, Professor Edward Zammit and the project managers of the Foundation handed over the development project to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Policy, Dr Lawrence Gonzi. In addition to the further implementation of the development project, the creation of a \u2018Maltese Forum for European Social Dialogue\u2019 (and its possible funding via the budget line B3- 4000 of DG EMP (D/1)) was discussed. Poland The Polish tripartite team drafted a national development plan entitled Towards a social pact for the young through social dialogue . The Polish social partners and government representatives were very satisfied with the workshop and with the content and target of the project, which was ambitious in its attempt to tackle youth unemployment, standing at 40% in Poland at the time. Unfortunately, the Polish development project has not progressed lately, even if at the beginning it had the full support of the Minister of Labour. The main reason for the delay and lack of implementation is to be found in a large-scale reorganisation of the public administration system. Within the Ministry of Labour, a great number of departments and units underwent mergers and reshuffles, which led to uncertainties as to the assignment of a responsible desk officer for the project. An additional reason for the unsatisfactory implementation of the project in Poland derives from the multitude and heterogeneity of the Polish social partners. Not all of them (three trade unions and four employers\u2019 organisations) were involved in the project to the same degree. This lack of involvement, consequently, resulted in a meagre motivation of the non-participants to defend, promote and implement a project in which they were not fully involved. One of the lessons to learn fom this negative experience is that the drafting of development projects should not be too ambitious in content. Rather, they should perhaps be limited in scope, allowing those who participate in the process to conceive and implement them on their own account. 46 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Slovenia After more than a year of discussions and negotiations within a high-level tripartite negotiating group, the Slovenian social partners and government representatives came to an agreement about the most important social and economic questions. This was just a year ago after the first Vienna workshop, in the course of which the Slovenian tripartite delegation presented the draft contents of the social agreement that was under discussion. It took another year to come to a conclusion. On Monday, 22 April 2003, the government and social partners finally signed the Social Agreement for the period 2003-2005 ( see http://www.sigov.si/mddsz/pdf/soc_sporazum_an.pdf). The high-level tripartite negotiating group, led by the Minister of Labour, Family and Social Affairs, Mr Vlado Dimovski, started negotiations, after two expert groups nominated by the Economic and Social Council had finished their work. The discussions in the negotiating group were very demanding and time-consuming, and several ministers were involved in the debate with the leading officials of the trade unions and employers\u2019 associations. In the last period, the negotiations took place almost every week and mostly more than once a week. Compared to the last social agreement, signed for the year 1996, the new agreement covers a much broader area. It includes the most important economic and social questions of interest to the social partners \u2014 from competitiveness, inflation, taxes, wages, employment, health and safety at work, social and legal security, to questions concerning family life, housing and equal opportunities. It defines the common and individual tasks the social partners have to perform in order to reach the general goal set down in the agreement which is \u2018sustainable economic and social development of the country\u2019. The most difficult issues, as usual, were public health insurance reform, tax system reform and wages policy. There was much discussion on the employers\u2019 side about the too heavy burden of the social insurance system on wages and competitiveness, while on the employees\u2019 side fears were expressed that many of the rights in the existing system are under threat because of the requests for greater competitiveness. On several occasions, the requests from both sets of social partners were so far apart and so contradictory that there was no rational answer at all. There were demands for lower taxation, lower public expenditures and similar or even higher rights in the public services paid from the budget. But finally, after long debate, concessions were made by all the partners and agreement was reached. The most important part of the Social Agreement is the common understanding that only a solution reached by way of dialogue is a good solution and that they will continue to operate in this direction for the whole period of the agreement (up to 2005). All the reforms that will take place in the next three years will be discussed with the social partners. There is also a commitment from the social partners that they will continue monitoring the developments and prepare their own yearly reports about the results, which will be discussed within the Economic and Social Council. Every partner in the agreement can, at his own will and at any time he feels it necessary, propose discussion about the contents of the agreement or raise any new questions to be discussed or added to it. 47 Overview ",
        "The agreement is published in the Official Gazette No. 40/2003 and is available on the website of the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs. It is also included as an annex to the Slovenian national report ( see Chapter 10 ) in order to offer the possibility to other acceding countries to use it as a benchmarking matrix in their search for similar tripartite social pacts. 48 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

        "Elias Mallis, Ministry of Finance Orestis Messios, Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance The aim of this national report is to examine how the participation of Cyprus in EMU and the adoption of the euro would affect the social dialogue and therefore the Cypriot economy. In particular, the report addresses the question of whether the industrial relations system, as it functions in Cyprus, would be capable of supporting the Cypriot economy in its road map to participate in EMU and adopt the euro in 2006. The summary at the end of the report answers the question of whether Cyprus has a consistent mechanism to retain full employment conditions and macroeconomic stability in conjunction with maintaining social coherence. On 1 January 1999, the common European currency, the euro, was gradually born, leading the European Union to a new economic era. The common currency and the European Central Bank are the end results regarding the integration in the monetary sector, since all Member States participating in the Economic and Monetary Union lose monetary sovereignty. The common currency on one hand and the European Central Bank on the other became the two instruments leading the European economy to a common monetary policy. Nevertheless, the necessity of fulfilling the Maastricht criteria is only the necessary condition for achieving economic convergence. For retaining macroeconomic stability in a national economy, the sufficient condition has to do with the real sector of the economy and thus with its competitiveness. While the euro gives stability in the nominal sector, at the same time it ignores the movements in relative prices in the domestic economy and abroad. To adopt the euro, the Member States had to fulfil a set of criteria with specific benchmarks, the so-called Maastricht criteria for nominal convergence. Moreover, what is highly important for the countries having adopted the euro and for those that will adopt it in the future is to gradually achieve real convergence. Real convergence implies that countries\u2019 per capita income has to converge with the EU average and competitiveness must be at high levels. For the 11 Member States at the moment participating in EMU and for the other 10 acceding countries that will participate after mid-2006, the only available remaining instrument for winning back a temporary loss of their competitiveness is to retain domestic prices at low levels. The new Member States have to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in order to adopt the euro, but at the same time they should create more flexible mechanisms in wage determination, bearing in mind that social policy will have to follow fiscal restraint. This is why the new Member States have to primarily design and follow such an economic policy so as to be ready to confront any forthcoming challenges arising from the adoption of the euro. The role of policy-makers on one hand and of the social partners on the other thus becomes crucial for achieving economic convergence and macroeconomic stability, as well as social cohesion. The relations of Cyprus with the EU date back to 1972 with the signing in December of that year of an Association Agreement, providing for the gradual elimination of all trade barriers and the creation in two stages of a customs union. The Turkish invasion and occupation of part of the Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus 1 53 ",
        "island prevented the smooth implementation of the agreement. In October 1987 a Protocol to the Association Agreement was signed providing for the transition into the second stage of the Association Agreement, i.e. the creation of a customs union. In July 1990 Cyprus submitted its formal application for membership to the Community. The relations between Cyprus and the EU entered into a new and decisive phase following the decision taken by the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, according to which accession negotiations between the EU and Cyprus, as well as 5 countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia), were to start in March 1998. The process of accession negotiations commenced on the 31 March 1998. 1 Accession negotiations were concluded within 2002 and on 16 April 2003 the accession treaties between the 10 candidate countries and the EU were signed in Athens. Economic situation The Cyprus economy is market-oriented, with the private sector playing the dominant role in the production sphere. The direct involvement of the government in production activities is small by international comparison and largely confined to the provision of utilities (energy, telecommunications), the administration of the two airports and education and health. The role of the government in the energy, telecommunications and the airport sectors is planned to be scaled down in the coming years, in the wake of the envisaged liberalisation of these sectors, thus, creating business opportunities for the private sector. Cyprus is characterised as an open economy, as manifested by the fact that exports and imports account for 100% of the GDP. The economy has a strong orientation towards the EU, underlined by the fact that around 53% of exports, 53% of imports and 80% of tourists are with EU countries. However, there are also strong links to Central and Eastern Europe, as well as with the Middle East. The Cyprus economy has exhibited dynamism, flexibility and adaptability throughout the period since Independence and managed to confront successfully the challenges that arose on the way. Economic development has been accompanied by a restructuring of the economy from the sectoral point of view. Cyprus has been gradually transformed from an economy dependent on the primary sectors at the beginning of the 1960s to a fully fledged export-oriented service economy today. Over the last years, the Cyprus economy has been diversifying in favour of financial and other business services, which display an increasing share in GDP contribution. The telecommunications and the computer and related activities sectors, which comprise the new economy sector, exhibited double-digit growth rates. As a total, services account for more than 71% of GDP, as against 21% of the secondary sectors and 8% of the primary sectors . In summary, the Cyprus economy has proven itself capable of successfully coping with the emerging challenge of globalisation and intensified competition. It has also coped, in a satisfactory 54 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 1 Apart from the 6 countries mentioned, the EU later began accession negotiations with 4 more countries (Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta), thus completing the list of 10 countries of the next enlargement.

On the whole, the Cyprus economy has performed well and holds promising prospects over the medium term. The major challenges have been: (cid:2) successful reconstruction, in the second half of the 1970s, following the Turkish invasion and its devastating effects on the economy; (cid:2) the liberalisation of trade vis-\u00e0-vis the EU, in the wake of the implementation of the Customs Union agreement with the EU, in the 1980s; (cid:2) the liberalisation of trade following the successful completion of the Uruguay Round in the 1990s; and (cid:2) the harmonisation with the EU through the implementation of far-reaching structural reforms at the beginning of this century. Figure 1 Distribution of nominal GDP per sector (%) The successful performance of the Cyprus economy has found due recognition in the various reports of the EU, the International Monetary Fund and international rating organisations, such as Standard and Poor\u2019s, Moodys and Fitch. Some of the salient elements of this success are: (cid:2) High per capita income: Cyprus ranks within the top 25 countries worldwide. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), it stands at about 80% of the EU average. (cid:2) High productivity growth of 3%. (cid:2) Low level of inequality in income distribution. The Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality, is about 0.32, very close to the EU average. 55 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1980 1990 2000 2001 2002 Primary sector Secondary sector Tertiary sector ",

In fact, the labour market in Cyprus is characterised by labour shortages, which have been addressed through the employment of foreign labour. During the last 5 years (1998-2002), the average registered unemployment rate was 3.2%. A short increase in the unemployment rate is expected for 2003, increasing the rate to 3.5%. It is important to note that the duration of unemployment is mainly short term rather than long term, since the ratio between short- to long-term unemployment is 3:5.

Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) The commencement of EMU on 1 January 1999, with the participation of 11 out of the 15 current EU Member States, constituted an unprecedented novelty, expected to heavily influence socio- economic developments, both inside and outside the Eurozone. Cyprus as an acceding country will certainly be confronted with policy implications from the participation in EMU and thus its preparation is vital. The establishment of EMU is a further vital step in the long process of economic integration of the EU. It follows the creation of a unified market and the Maastricht Treaty, which incorporated 57 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1012 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 Cyprus EU 15 ",

The European Central Bank has been granted substantial powers, similar to those of the Central Bank of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is fully independent from the influence of national governments and the European Commission, and does not have to follow any instructions from them; its 6-member executive board, including its Governor, serve for an 8-year term and can be neither dismissed nor re-appointed; its primary and overriding objective is to promote price stability in the Eurozone. In fact, many of the provisions of the constitution of the European Central Bank serve the purpose of insulating the European Monetary Authority from political pressures to pursue other objectives, for example, support growth or reduce unemployment. The foreign exchange policy will remain the domain of the European Council of Ministers and notably the ECOFIN. The Maastricht Treaty defines the convergence criteria that countries wishing to participate in EMU should adhere to. The achievement of a high degree of convergence is rightly regarded as a necessary precondition for the success of EMU. The analysis in the previous section reveals that Cyprus is close to fulfilling all Maastricht convergence criteria. Other preconditions for participation in EMU include the safeguarding of independence of the national Central Banks, the prohibition of the direct financing of the public sector by the Central Bank, the prohibition of a privileged access of the broad public sector to financial institutions and the liberalisation of capital flows. Furthermore, countries wishing to enter into EMU must participate for at least 2 years in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II, which will be established, with a view to regulating the foreign exchange rate relations between those EU Member States participating in EMU and those not participating. We shall now examine the existing situation in Cyprus with regard to the above-mentioned preconditions. 58 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Participation of Cyprus in EMU Cyprus will fully satisfy the acquis communautaire concerning EMU by accession. Although for 2003 there will be a temporary divergence from the Maastricht criteria, there is a road map to satisfy the criteria by 2004. The Central Bank of Cyprus is responsible for the conduct of monetary and foreign exchange rate policy. It has exercised these duties in a way that safeguarded a high degree of macroeconomic stability. By 1 January 2001, interest rate ceiling regime was abandoned and a law passed by the House of Parliament liberalised interest rates. 2 Moreover, in mid-2002 the House of Parliament, in its obligation to harmonise with the acquis communautaire, changed the law for the Central Bank of Cyprus. Before the change of the Central Bank law, the President of the Republic of Cyprus had the authority to appoint the Central Bank Governor and the power to dismiss him. Moreover, the Governor of the Central Bank was bound by the Constitution to follow the instructions of the Minister of Finance and implement the decisions of the Council of Ministers. The government of Cyprus adopted the required constitutional changes and hence safeguarded in this manner the independence of the Central Bank. In addition, law did not prohibit the financing of the government deficits from the Central Bank. In fact, the government of Cyprus has extensively utilised this possibility in the past, particularly in the late 1980s following a political decision to switch from external to internal sources of borrowing for the financing of fiscal deficits. This policy, which fuelled inflationary pressures, was reduced substantially in the 1990s. In the context of the accession negotiations, the government of Cyprus stated its intention to prohibit government borrowing from the Central Bank before accession. In June 2002, the House of Parliament passed a law prohibiting government borrowing from the Central Bank. This development is expected to rationalise the way the government finances its deficits and thus more easily control domestic prices. The public sector in Cyprus has no privileged access to financial institutions. The inflow and outflow of capital is monitored by the Central Bank and regulated by restrictions. In the last years, the government of Cyprus has proceeded with a gradual liberalisation of capital inflows and outflows, and has committed itself to intensify this process of liberalisation in the context of the accession negotiations currently taking place. Regarding the exchange rate policy, the Authorities of Cyprus have pegged the Cyprus pound to the ECU since July 1992. This role of the ECU as an anchor for the Cyprus pound was one of the main factors that safeguarded relative price stability in Cyprus in the last few years. With the replacement of the ECU by the euro from 1 January 1999, the Cyprus pound has been pegged to the euro in the current implied parity (1 CYP = e 1.7086). In the near future, it is planned to widen the official exchange fluctuation bands of the Cyprus pound to +/-15% around the central parity, in line with the respective provisions of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II. At the same time, the Central Bank will target narrower bands of +/-2.25% for policy purposes. 59 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus 2 Two years after interest rates' liberalisation (1 January 2001), the Central Bank reduced interest rates five times by 1 / 2 % each time. The basic Lombard rate is currently at 4.5%. ",
        "It is evident from the above discussion that Cyprus has made substantial progress with regard to the required legal and structural changes. Nonetheless, it still needs to promote some further reforms of its financial system, with a view to conforming to the acquis communautaire and fulfilling the preconditions for participation in EMU. The promotion of the required changes is not, however, expected to pose insurmountable problems given the high degree of nominal convergence with the EU and the near fulfillment of all Maastricht criteria. The establishment of EMU has no close precedent and it is highly controversial among politicians and economists. Its main advantages are: (cid:2) Imposition of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability in the Eurozone, expected to lead to enhanced credibility, a positive climate among entrepreneurs and lower interest rates, thus creating the appropriate conditions for sustained growth. (cid:2) Foreign exchange rate stability, substantial reduction of the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign exchange rates and substantial reduction of the transaction costs associated with foreign currency exchange. (cid:2) Enhancement of the significance of the euro as a currency for international pricing of exports and imports, and an international reserve currency. The main risks associated with the establishment of EMU are: (cid:2) The establishment of EMU will inevitably lead to a transfer of responsibilities concerning monetary and foreign exchange policies and, to a significant extent, also fiscal policy, from the national to the supranational level. Hence, national governments will have less instruments at their disposal to influence aggregate demand and effectively exercise macroeconomic policies, or restore, if considered necessary, competitiveness, for example through a devaluation of the national currency. (cid:2) In the Eurozone, monetary and macroeconomic policy in general will be uniform. Thus, eventual differences in national conditions with regard to competitiveness or economic cycles will not be taken into account. For example, a reduction of interest rates, which is appropriate for one country experiencing an adverse shock, may be inappropriate for another country experiencing inflation pressures. (cid:2) The room for conducting social policies according to national priorities will also be restricted, since the government will not be easily able to run fiscal deficits to finance government expenditures. (cid:2) It is generally expected that the euro will appreciate in real terms, at least during the initial period, thus affecting the export performance of the countries participating in EMU vis-\u00e0-vis third countries. In order to utilise effectively the advantages of EMU and minimise the associated risks, it is widely acknowledged that the following conditions should be met: (cid:2) High degree of real and nominal convergence of the countries participating in EMU and of the acceding countries. (cid:2) Co-ordination of macroeconomic policies and strict adherence to the Maastricht convergence criteria. 60 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "(cid:2) Promotion of structural reforms in the labour markets, with a view to making them more adaptive to market conditions. 3 Cyprus will become a member of the EU on 1 May 2004. Thus the repercussions from the establishment of EMU will take place only gradually. In the short- and medium-term, Cyprus will mainly be affected by the evolution of the euro vis-\u00e0-vis the British pound due to the high significance of the UK and also the great significance of dollar-based trade for Cyprus. For example, the current tendency (i.e. the real effective appreciation of the euro against the dollar and the sterling pound) implies an appreciation of the Cyprus pound vis-\u00e0-vis these currencies. The appreciation of the Cyprus pound has a negative effect on exports since it makes them more expensive. 4 However, at the same time, it makes imports from these countries cheaper. Moreover, an appreciation of the Cyprus pound could reduce inflationary pressures through lower import prices. Furthermore, given that a large proportion of Cyprus imports consists of raw materials and fuels, the lower import prices translate into lower production costs and thus to lower prices charged by domestic producers, again lowering inflation and positively affecting competitiveness. Furthermore, Cyprus will also be influenced by the evolution of the activity level in the Eurozone. Assuming that a successful EMU will lead to enhanced economic activity in the Eurozone, then positive spill-over effects should also be expected for Cyprus. In the long term, Cyprus will benefit from lower interest rates, exchange rate stability and greater price transparency. Moreover, integration is expected to lead to greater confidence of markets. However, Cyprus will be confronted with the problem that macroeconomic policy in the EMU area will most probably be formulated according to the needs of large countries. This would become a problem at a time when economic conditions in Cyprus might require the adoption of a different policy. For example, the current tendency in the Eurozone is the maintenance of low interest rates, which is a suitable policy for most EMU countries that exhibit restrained growth. In countries such as Ireland, with exceptionally high growth rates during the past years, a more suitable policy would be to increase interest rates in order to avoid inflationary pressures. Cyprus may be confronted in the future with a similar situation to Ireland today. Notwithstanding that the Maastricht criteria are too concrete and no diversions are accepted, the government of Cyprus has elaborated a very ambitious Social Agenda for the next years. The Agenda gives emphasis to socially excluded groups, such as women, the elderly and the disabled. In parallel, the government is promoting targeted social measures and its overall effort is to make aspects of the Cyprus labour market more flexible. The long-term target, however, aims at achieving fiscal sustainability. 61 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus 3 Labour market rigidities have recently been limited due to the harmonisation process with the acquis communautaire. The law that provides for the regulation of part-time work is one example. 4 Given that a large proportion of GDP comes from the tourist sector, the appreciation of the Cyprus pound vis-\u00e0-vis the euro reduces the competitiveness of the Cyprus economy due to higher export prices, thus leading to a deterioration of the terms of trade. ",
        "Political situation Modern institutions necessary to enhance democratic procedures characterise the political system in Cyprus. The 1960 Constitution includes specific fundamental political freedoms and gives a balanced set of powers to the President and the Parliament of the Republic. Cyprus compares favourably with Western-type democracies. According to the Constitution, Cyprus is an independent and sovereign state. The people directly elect the President for a period of 5 years and he or she always belongs to the Greek-Cypriot community. The Constitution gives a wide range of powers to the President of the Republic, the most important of which is the fact that Parliament cannot force him to resign. It is worth noting that the Constitution clearly distinguishes between the 3 interrelated powers of Executive, Judiciary and Parliamentary, thus making the political system functional and progressive. The Vice-President belongs to the Turkish-Cypriot community 5 , while the Council of Ministers consists of 11 ministries. Every 5 years, the Republic of Cyprus has parliamentary elections. The Parliament of the Republic of Cyprus consists of 56 seats belonging to the Greek-Cypriot community and there are 3 more seats for Armenians, Latins and Morons. Twenty-four more seats belong to the Turkish-Cypriot community; these remain empty since the Turkish-Cypriot MPs withdrew from the Parliament in 1963. The Parliament, according to the Constitution, has the power of approving or disapproving laws of the state. The Parliament cannot pass a law that may result in an increase of the state expenses beyond those provided in the year\u2019s budget nor can it be forced to dissolve unless its members agree to do so. Main political parties There are 4 leading entities in the political arena in Cyprus. Their activities during the last 30 years have been determined by their ideological positions, as well as the attitude they hold on the form of solution to the Cyprus problem. (It is important to note that the two largest political parties agree on the type of solution for a federal, bi-communal and bi-zonal Republic of Cyprus.) Nonetheless, all political parties can be divided into 3 broad groups \u2014 right, left and centre. The oldest political party in Cyprus, and since the last parliamentary elections the most populist, is the left-wing party AKEL. AKEL is the political continuation of the Cyprus Communist Party, established in the early 1920s. It has strong relations with the so-called labour class and is influential with the trade unions. The party has maintained a very positive stance regarding the finding of a compromise solution to the Cyprus problem. DHSY is the leading right-wing political party in Cyprus. It was established in the mid-1970s by the former President of the Republic of Cyprus, Glafkos Clerides. It is a wide-based party and its supporters were always in favour of a compromise solution to the Cyprus issue. In parallel, DHSY was from the beginning supportive of the accession of Cyprus to the EU. 62 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 5 After the Turkish invasion in 1974 and the consequent occupation of the northern part of the island, all powers and state posts given by the Constitution to the Turkish-Cypriot community remain empty. ",
        "DHKO exists in the centre right. This party was basically introduced by the former President of the Republic of Cyprus, Spyros Kyprianou. The current President of DHKO is Tassos Papadopoulos, who is the new President of the Republic of Cyprus. The party was always in favour of Cyprus\u2019 accession to the EU. As far as the Cyprus problem is concerned, it has accepted the idea of forming the solution on the foundations of a federal state. The centre left is represented by the Social Democratic party, KISOS. It was born out of the SP. EDEK and also supported the EU accession perspective of Cyprus. Nonetheless, KISOS was relatively tough concerning its position on the solution to the Cyprus problem. Besides these 4 main parties, there are some smaller political entities, namely EDH, NEO, ADHK and the Green Party. All of these were formed by politicians who had left the main parties. Their parliamentary power is limited to one MP. Parliamentary elections, 2001 The official results of the last parliamentary elections in 2001 established the power of the main political parties in Cyprus as follows: \u25a0 AKEL: 34.5% \u25a0 DHSY: 34% \u25a0 DHKO: 15% \u25a0 KISOS: 6.5% \u25a0 Others: 10% The number of seats in Parliament is 56. Based on the above results, AKEL won 20 seats, DHSY 19, DHKO 9, KISOS 4 and the other parties 4. Presidential elections, 2003 The last presidential elections were held in February 2003. As a result, the leader of the centre-right party, DHKO, Tassos Papadopoulos, was elected as President. Three political parties formed a coalition (AKEL, DHKO and KISOS) and supported Mr Papadopoulos, who won the elections with an absolute majority of the vote of 51%. The Green Party and some other smaller movements also supported Mr Papadopoulos. The new President of the Republic of Cyprus was elected according to his political manifesto, in which he exhibited his positions on many crucial issues such as the Cyprus problem, his view for the Cyprus economy as a full member of the EU and other proposals for confronting internal and social issues. The political rivals of Mr Papadopoulos were the former president, Mr Clerides, and the former Attorney General, Mr Markides, basically coming from the same party, DHSY. Mr Clerides took about 38% of the votes and Mr Markides about 6.5%. Current composition of government According to the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, after the President is elected he or she is responsible for the appointment of the Council of Ministers. There are 11 ministries, which the new President distributed to the 3 political parties that supported him, thus forming a coalition government. Two seats in the Council of Ministers were given to politicians coming from the other smaller political movements that had supported Mr Papadopoulos. 63 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",
        "One of the most important ministries is the Ministry of Finance, which basically is responsible, in co-operation with the Planning Bureau and the Central Bank of Cyprus, for implementing the acquis communautaire and preparing the Cyprus economy to participate on time in EMU. The Ministry of Finance was allocated to DHKO. Relations with the European Parliament Most of the Cypriot political parties maintain good relations and close ties with the corresponding political groups or parties in the European Parliament. DHSY is a full member of the European People\u2019s Party (EEP CD), which currently has the largest number of European MPs in the European Parliament. KISOS is a full member of the Party of European Socialists (PES) and AKEL is a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL). EDH is a full member of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party (ELDR), while DHKO participates, as an observer, to the same Group. In addition, the Cypriot Green Party is also a full member of the corresponding Union for Europe Group; Greens: Green Group in the European Parliament (UEG). The next European elections will take place in 2004 and Cyprus is expected to elect its first 6 European MPs. Opinion polls on EU accession and EMU Every year, RAI Consultants Services Ltd conducts public opinion research on behalf of the Economic Research and Planning section of the Cyprus Popular Bank. This opinion poll has taken place since 1997 and is considered to be one of the most credible among the 15 Member States of the EU. The research, conducted during the period 25 November 2002 to 7 January 2003, made special reference to EMU and the accession of Cyprus in the EU. The sample was multi-stage and randomly selected, and covered all sections of the population aged 18-75 years who are permanent residents of Cyprus. The research was based on the standards of the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR). According to the results of the poll, the Cypriots consider that EU accession will benefit Cyprus by enhancing its economic growth, political security, human rights and the rights of employees. The score recorded of 3.9 (with 5 being the highest possible and 1 the lowest) is the highest since 1996. When asked about the adequacy of information on EU matters, the majority of people who participated in the poll (64%) said there was enough information for EU issues. However, results also show that there is still room for improvement since 34% of participants considered the information acquired as inadequate. The opinion poll gave increasing support to the euro. In 2002, 71% of respondents had a positive opinion about the common European currency. It is worth noting that public opinion in favour of the euro changed significantly after the final results of the Copenhagen Summit in December 2002. 64 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Industrial relations Main features Industrial relations in Cyprus, to a very large extent, are based on a voluntary system, strongly dependent on tripartism. Tripartism, voluntarism and social dialogue have been the basis for forming and implementing social and economic policy, and are considered to be the backbone of the successful industrial relations system that has developed since the island\u2019s independence in 1960. With a view to the true voluntary nature of the system, existing legislation governing industrial relations is minimal. Even so, mechanisms that have been freely agreed upon do exist, thus governing the behaviour of the social partners. These mechanisms derive from the Industrial Relations Code ( see Annex 1 ), in essence a \u2018gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2019 between the social partners, which was signed in 1977 and remains the only \u2018binding\u2019 document regulating collective bargaining and dispute settlement. The procedures laid out in the Industrial Relations Code, over the years, have been highly respected and adhered to by the social partners, with cases of non-abidance being few and far between. Employers\u2019 and trade union organisations The government\u2019s policy in the area of industrial relations has been to foster and develop strong employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organisations. This policy has been instrumental in the success of the voluntary nature of the industrial relations system, while at the same time employers and workers through their representatives have gained a high level of respect and flexibility for dealing with problems or crises that arise. Both employers\u2019 organisations and trade unions are well established, with strong and effective organisational structures, and most have decades of experience in their respective fields. Employers\u2019 organisations There are two employers\u2019 organisations in Cyprus: the OEB (Employers and Industrialists Federation), and the CCCI (Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry). Both organisations have equal representation in the various tripartite bodies, such as the Labour Advisory Board, the Economic Consultative Committee, the Social Security Committee and others. They also offer extensive services to their members and between them they represent nearly the entirety of the business/entrepreneurial community of Cyprus, since all individual professional associations are affiliated with either the OEB or CCCI, or in some cases with both. Individual enterprises can become direct members of either, or both, of these organisations or they can be affiliated with them through their membership to their professional association, which in turn is a member of the employers\u2019 organisations. The CCCI is a member of Eurochambers, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), etc. The OEB is a member of the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), the Union of Industrial and Employers\u2019 Confederations of Europe (UNICE), and others. Trade unions Unionisation rates are considerably high, with between 67%-70% of all employees in Cyprus belonging to a trade union. More specifically in 2001, 68% of all employees were members of trade unions. 65 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",
        "The main national, multisectoral workers\u2019 organisations are the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO), the Cyprus Workers Confederation (SEK), the Democratic Labour Federation of Cyprus (DEOK), and the Pancyprian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (POAS). PEO is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), SEK is a member of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Greek General Confederation of Workers, whilst DEOK and POAS are members of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). Other independent sectoral workers\u2019 organisations are the Pancyprian Union of Public Servants (PASYDY), the Pancyprian Organisation of Greek Teachers (POED), the Organisation of Greek Secondary Education Teachers (OELMEK) and the Union of Banking Employees of Cyprus (ETYK) Table 2 provides the latest available data (for 2001) concerning trade union membership for the main trade unions in the country. Table 2 Trade union membership in Cyprus, 2001 Trade unions Number of members Total unionised employees (%) National multisectoral trade unions PEO 63,871 36.0% SEK 64,731 36.4% DEOK 7,178 4.0% POAS ,199 0.1% Independent sectoral trade unions* PASYDY 16,466 9.3% OELMEK 4,620 2.6% POED 4,401 2.5% ETYK 9,236 5.2% Others 6,952 3.9% TOTAL 177,654 100.0% * It should be noted that in the case of the independent sectoral trade unions, membership by employees in each sector is close to 100%. Collective bargaining and collective agreements Collective bargaining is widespread and is by far the most representative method for agreeing terms and conditions of employment between the two sides (employers and workers). As already stated, collective agreements include and regulate most, if not all, terms and conditions of employment and in most cases they are of a 2 or 3-year duration. This free participating system has been further strengthened by the enforcement of the new EU harmonised labour legislation, which was put into force on 1 January 2003. The new legislation has effectively raised the minimum standards for certain terms and conditions of employment (e.g. annual leave, hours of rest, maximum hours of work), while the principle of equal treatment (in all possible cases) is now truly embedded within the legislative system and the industrial relations mechanism. Even though collective agreements are not legally binding, there are specific provisions in the abovementioned body of new legislation that ensures that collective agreements are amended so that provisions that are contrary to the newly enforced legislation are effectively removed/deleted. This is especially experienced in the area of equal pay, with all collective agreements currently in the process of being examined. 66 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "It should be noted that all collective agreements in Cyprus include the provision of Cost of Living Allowance (COLA). The COLA system is calculated biannually and, despite long-term negotiations between the social partners, it has remained to a large extent unchanged for decades. The social partners concluded their talks on the subject in 1999 and the result was the removal of increases in indirect (consumer) taxation from the calculation process of the COLA system. It should be noted that all social partners (with the exception of PEO) agreed on these changes, but even so PEO has abided by the agreement. The COLA system, though unique throughout the European Union, has not proved to be the cause of inflationary pressures on wages. This is mainly due to trade union strategies that limit wage increase demands to the height of yearly national productivity (plus COLA). Furthermore, over the last 2 years, in many cases collective agreements have been agreed upon with insignificant wage increases, especially in companies or sectors that are experiencing difficulties. In conclusion, the COLA system has proved to be a catalytic factor in ensuring the signing of long- term collective agreements, which has the effect of ensuring industrial peace. Wages, in money terms, in 2001, increased by 5.10%, while in real terms wages increased by 3.10%. Relevant data for 2002 is not yet available, but it is estimated that wages in money terms increased by 5.50% and in real terms by 2.70%. National and sectoral-level collective bargaining National-level collective bargaining is limited to the constraints of sectoral-level bargaining, obviously due to Cyprus\u2019 small geographical size. Consequently, a national-level collective agreement is also a sectoral agreement, while due to the small size of Cyprus, sectoral agreements are also national (since they have pancyprian coverage). Sectoral/national-level collective bargaining involves direct negotiations between the multisectoral trade unions and the representative employer\u2019s organisation (relevant employer\u2019s professional association and/or the OEB, or the CCCI). Table 3 (overleaf) provides the latest available data (for 2000) on national and/or sectoral agreements. It should be noted that the data is based on the information provided by trade unions to the Trade Union Registrar and there is currently no way to validate it. The figures show that approximately 41.4% of all trade union members, or approximately 73,500 employees (in the private sector), are covered by national/sectoral collective agreements, while if the public and semi- government sectors are included (18.71%), then a total of 60.1% of all trade union members are covered by national and/or sectoral collective agreements. Enterprise-level collective agreements As already mentioned, it is estimated that approximately 450 enterprise-level collective agreements are currently in force. These collective agreements are drawn up and negotiated at company level, usually directly between the employees\u2019 trade union representatives and the employer. In a number of cases, employers seek the professional assistance of the industrial relations departments of their employers\u2019 organisation and they may participate in the bipartite direct negotiations. 67 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",

Mediation Both in the case of national/sectoral and enterprise collective agreements, if the negotiations reach a deadlock, the dispute is referred to the Industrial Relations Service of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance for mediation. It is, of course, imperative that the Service has the necessary infrastructure and manpower to deal effectively with the mediation process, since the Code also lays out specific time limits within which the mediation process must be carried out. Throughout 2002, the Industrial Relations Service handled a total of 295 labour disputes. According to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Code, 7 disputes resulted in a deadlock, 70 were referred to direct negotiations, 2 were sent to arbitration and 7 were withdrawn. Consequently, another 118 labour disputes were resolved and 91 were still ongoing (pending) on 31 December 2002. The mediation mechanism is governed by the Industrial Relations Code ( see Annex 1 ). It should be noted that the Code is adhered to by all parties, who accept the recognised procedures within the Code. Referral of an industrial dispute to the Industrial Relations Service can be made by either party and according to the Code the other party is obliged to accept the referral. The fact that the 68 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Code is adhered to, both by employers and trade unions, is by far the strongest proof that the voluntary industrial relations system is extremely effective. Extension mechanisms Due to the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Cyprus, extension mechanisms for collective agreements do not exist. Even though such a system does not officially exist, in practice the small size of most sectors of economic activity, and the small number of enterprises active in a specific trade/sector/process, leads to a natural extension mechanism governed by the simple rules of economic theory. Consequently, competing enterprises with individual collective agreements, in most cases, have terms and conditions of employment that are similar, if not the same. This procedure is a natural extension of the fact that employers are acquainted with each other and in most cases the trade union representatives responsible for negotiations for the renewal of enterprise collective agreements in a specific sector are the same individuals. The provision of the 13th salary can also be seen as an example of the natural extension mechanism, since the obligation of the employer to provide his employees with a 13th salary is not governed by legislation. Even so, the overwhelming majority of employers (irrespective of whether they have signed a collective agreement or not) do provide their employees with a 13th salary at Christmas time (all collective agreements do have a provision for a full 13th salary to be provided and in some cases even for half a 14th salary). Apart from the abovementioned \u2018informal\u2019 extension mechanisms for collective agreements, there are also a number of national multisectoral agreements, such as the agreement on working hours reached between OEB, SEK and PEO in 1992, which provided for the gradual reduction of weekly working hours from 40 to 38 until 1998. Another example is the national agreement on occupational safety and health, signed on 15.5.95 as a Declaration-National Policy document. Tripartism Tripartism remains the key method by which consensus is achieved among the social partners. As already mentioned, there are a large number of tripartite bodies and committees that operate on a regular basis, each dealing with their own specific areas of interest. Furthermore, tripartite bodies, like the Labour Advisory Board, regularly assign specific subjects to tripartite technical committees that work together according to their assigned terms of reference. This mechanism was used during the long and arduous harmonisation process, with tripartite technical committees working individually on each harmonising draft legislation. Further to this, when draft laws are sent to Parliament, or any other issues are to be discussed in the House of Representatives, the social partners are always invited to participate in the discussion and presentation of the subjects at the relevant parliamentary committees. Another important feature of the policy-formulating \u2018power\u2019 of the social partners is the fact that when unanimous decisions are taken by the Labour Advisory Board, then the Parliament respects that decision (even if an opposite view prevailed in Parliament prior to the Board\u2019s unanimity). Role of social dialogue In view of the fact that Cyprus has a long history of successfully adhering to and implementing social dialogue, it is expected that social dialogue can, and will, play an important role throughout the EMU convergence process. 69 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",
        "In light of the existing mechanisms and procedures, it is expected that the government of Cyprus will be in a position to play a catalytic role in utilising and activating the social partners, through existing tripartite bodies or, if need be, by the formation of new ones. Conclusion This report examines whether Cyprus would be able to maintain full employment conditions, macroeconomic stability and industrial peace while the economy adjusts to a new economic environment by adopting the euro and participating in EMU. Cyprus has committed itself to adjusting to the EMU framework and adopting the euro, the earliest possible after accession. Participation in EMU implies that the government of Cyprus should follow a specific economic policy to treat macroeconomic policy as a matter of common concern. As a result, it is very interesting for political and socio-economic reasons to address the implications arising from the new socio-economic environment and furthermore to assess whether the industrial relations system in Cyprus is efficient enough to support the growth of the economy during the transition of adopting the euro. During the last decades, the Cyprus economy has proven itself capable of confronting external shocks. The Cyprus economy has been diversifying in favour of the financial and other business services, which display an increasing share in GDP contribution. The economy has exhibited high growth rates during the last years, internal and external macroeconomic stability and at the same time near-full employment conditions. The adoption of the euro, being a gradual process, needs a clear and specific policy action plan, which will guide all parties and effectively face any challenges. The new Member States have to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in order to adopt the euro, but at the same time they should create more flexible mechanisms in wage determination, bearing in mind that social policy will have to be implemented in the context of fiscal restraint. Although Cyprus will satisfy the acquis communautaire regarding EMU by accession, it has made significant progress in modernising its institutional capacity, necessary to implement EMU successfully and to adopt the euro. Cyprus is well prepared to complete the EMU convergence process successfully through the mechanisms and structures developed over the years in the areas of social dialogue and industrial relations. Social dialogue has played an instrumental role in shaping and forming the industrial relations scene on the island since Cyprus\u2019 independence in 1960. The prominence of social dialogue and tripartite co-operation has its roots in the existence of strong employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organisations, a fact that creates the necessary balance of power within the functioning of the industrial relations process (consultation and social dialogue, consultation, mediation). Trade union coverage is amongst the highest throughout Western Europe, while at the same time the two employers\u2019 organisations represent close to the entirety of the Cyprus business/entrepreneurial community. 70 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The fostering of this bipartite balance of power has been the government\u2019s main strategy for ensuring the maintenance of industrial peace, while the voluntary system that was drawn up, and agreed upon in 1977 in the form of the Industrial Relations Code, has ensured that all partners, behave in exactly that way, i.e. as partners and not \u2018enemies\u2019. Even though, undoubtedly, employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 views and positions can sometimes be directly opposed, adhering to the Industrial Relations Code has laid down the mechanisms and procedures required to ensure that, once the Code is followed, very few cases of labour disputes or possible industrial unrest lead to industrial action, or strikes. Industrial peace is further achieved by the fact that the provisions of collective agreements, whether these are at national, sectoral or company level, cover a large percentage of employees nationwide. It is also important to note that the long duration of these agreements (2-3 years) is also another reason why industrial peace prevails to the extent it does. The report provides details about the procedure followed by the social partners for dealing with issues or problems. Cyprus for this reason has a large number of tripartite committees and bodies that operate on a regular and ongoing basis, with the Labour Advisory Board being the most important of these tripartite committees. Furthermore, it must be stressed that even though bodies like the Labour Advisory Board are voluntary structures, which in essence have no legal power to enforce their opinions or decisions, they are respected as if they had legal powers. In conclusion, Cyprus has a long history of a successful industrial relations system that has provided the social partners with decades of experience in collaborative social partnership, resulting in the effective dealing of socio-economic problems and crises. Consequently, it is believed that, as in the past, the near future of the EMU convergence process will be achieved successfully by utilising the existing voluntary social dialogue mechanisms. 71 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",

        "ANNEX 1 Industrial Relations Code of Cyprus 73 Part I. Substantive Provisions A. The right to organise Both sides recognise the right of employers and employees to organise freely and to belong to organisations of their own choice without any interference or victimisation from either side. B. Collective Bargaining, collective agreements and joint consultation It is accepted that free collective bargaining constitutes the basic way for the determination of conditions of employment and remuneration. Therefore, both sides undertake: 1. To promote collective bargaining and joint consultation. 2. To negotiate in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding, bearing in mind the prevailing industrial relations principles and practices, the public interest, the usual criteria on which the determination of wages and conditions of employment is based, as well as such criteria as might be agreed upon by government and the two sides in industry with regard to a prices and incomes policy. 3. To observe faithfully the provisions of collective agreements resulting from collective bargaining. 4. To follow the procedure specified in Part II.A of this Code for the negotiation or renewal of collective agreements. 5. Not to resort to strike or lock-out in disputes about rights (grievances) as the term is defined in Part II.B. 6. Given that unofficial strikes during a valid collective agreement are condemned the federation/union concerned will take all measures that they consider necessary to end that strike. 7. Given that any action by an employer which violates a valid collective agreement is condemned the employers\u2019 association concerned will take all measures that they consider necessary for the observance of the agreement. C. Issues proper for collective bargaining and joint consultation, and management prerogatives 1. In accordance with the generally accepted principles and practices of industrial relations, the existence is recognised of issues considered as bargainable, others considered as consultative and others considered as prerogatives of management. These issues are not defined in the present Code; however, it is desirable that they should be specified, if possible, in collective agreements. 2. Even if no reference has been made in a collective agreement to an issue as being proper for joint consultation so long as the union or the employees contend that a decision on the said issue may adversely affect them or may have a repercussion on their relations with their employer, the employer should engage in joint consultation with the union or the employees. Provided, however, that in cases of issues considered as prerogatives of management the employer is entitled to act without consulting either the union or his employees. ",
        "3. (a) As regards issues proper for joint consultation the final decision rests with the employer. It is recognised, however, that the employer is bound to pay due regard to the union\u2019s or the employees\u2019 views on issues proper for joint consultation and to give reasons for any negative answer. (b) Without prejudice to the employer\u2019s right to take a final decision on issues proper for joint consultation, both sides may, in case of disagreement, ask for the advice and assistance of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. (c) Provided that neither the union nor the employer may, eventually, resort to strike or lock- out, if agreement cannot be reached on issues appropriate for joint consultation. D. Announcements 1. Before any announcement is made in the press, during the process of collective bargaining or the discussion of a dispute, this will be agreed upon, if possible, by both sides. 2. The Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance may make a public announcement regarding a dispute in which it mediates, if such dispute attracts the interest of the public. The Ministry\u2019s announcement will be objective and of an informative nature and, where possible, it will be prepared in consultation with the two sides. Nevertheless the Minister of Labour and Social Insurance may make a public statement without consulting either side, if the dispute affects public interest. 3. Provided that the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs do not prevent the two sides from making public statements with a view to popularising their claims or their official position thereon so long as such statements do not refer to the proceedings at specific negotiation meetings. E. Conventions and recommendations of the international labour organisation Strict adherence is hereby affirmed to the provisions of all International Labour Conventions which the government of Cyprus has ratified. With regard to the Recommendations accepted by Cyprus\u2019 both sides declare that they will make every effort to conform to their provisions as far as possible. Part II. Procedural Provisions A. Procedure for the settlement of disputes about interests \u2018Dispute about interests\u2019 means a dispute arising out of negotiations for the conclusion of a new collective agreement or for the renewal of an existing collective agreement or, in general, out of the negotiation of a new claim. 1. Direct negotiations (a) Submission of claims for the conclusion of a new agreement The recognised union or unions representing the employees of the undertaking concerned may submit to the employer claims in writing, with a view to concluding a collective agreement, covering the class of employees whom they represent, comprising the submitted claims as well as other conditions of employment which may already exist within the undertaking. The employer is obliged to commence direct negotiations with the union/unions concerned on the submitted claims not later than 3 weeks from receiving the claims or, in the case of organisations operating on an island-wide basis (such as employers\u2019 associations and public corporations), not later than one month, provided the 74 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "union has in the meantime expounded its claims in writing, after giving the unions reason- able notice of his intention to commence such negotiations. (b) Submission of claims for the renewal of an agreement (i) In the case of an existing collective agreement the party seeking its modification should give the other party at least two months notice, prior to the expiration of such agreement, of its intention to do so, accompanied by a list of claims and/or modifications, except where, in the case of small-size undertakings, it is otherwise stipulated in the collective agreement. (ii) Generally, in the event of renewal of existing agreements and provided both parties agree, it is not necessary to submit claims two months in advance provided notification is given in writing of the intention to do so and provided the claims are submitted at any time before the expiration of the agreement. In such cases the existing collective agreement will continue in force for a period equal to the length of the delay in the submission of the claims, unless such delay does not exceed 15 days. (iii) Provided that where the party seeking the modification of an existing agreement has failed to give notice of his such intention to the other side before commencement of the two-month period prior to the expiration of the agreement, as is provided by para 1(b), the collective agreement shall remain in force for another year. 2. Mediation (a) In the case of negotiations for the conclusion of a collective agreement for the first time and where it is established that all possibilities of direct negotiations have been exhausted, both sides, either jointly or separately, may, after the lapse of a reasonable period from the commencement of the negotiations, which should not be shorter than 6 weeks from the date of receipt of the claims by the employer but not longer than three months, except where direct negotiations have been carried on in good faith during that period, submit the dispute to the Senior Industrial Relations Officer or the District Labour Officer, as the case may be, (from now on referred to as \u201cthe Ministry\u201d) for mediation. (b) As regards negotiations for the renewal of a collective agreement, a dispute shall not be submitted to the Ministry for mediation earlier than 21 days from the date of expiration of the existing collective agreement. However, no dispute over the renewal of an existing collective agreement shall be submitted to the Ministry later than two months from the date of the expiration of the agreement unless negotiations started without delay and have been carried on in good faith beyond that period. (c) Submission of a dispute to mediation by one side, by virtue of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above, implies an obligation of the other side to accept the mediation. (d) The Ministry offers to mediate in a dispute, even where such mediation has not been requested, if it considers it expedient to do so. In such a case acceptance of the offer for mediation by one side implies a similar obligation of the other side. (e) The Ministry will make every effort to deal promptly with the disputes and to see that they are settled the soonest possible. (f) If the Ministry cannot effect a mutually accepted solution to a dispute it shall, at the request of either side, declare the dispute as having reached deadlock and either side will be free to take any lawful measures in furtherance or support of their claims or interests. However, before such measures are taken, 10 days notice should be given to the other side and communicated to the Ministry. Provided that the Ministry may not declare a dispute about interests as having reached deadlock before the lapse of at least six weeks from the 75 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",
        "date of submitting the dispute to the Ministry, unless, in the opinion of the Ministry, no useful purpose is served by further mediation. 3. Arbitration (a) Without prejudice to the provisions of para 2(f) of Part IIA, where both sides so agree, they may refer all or any of the issues of a dispute to arbitration, at any point in time either before or after the submission of the dispute to the Ministry. (b) Where both sides agree to submit a dispute to arbitration they undertake to accept the arbitrator\u2019s award as binding. 4. Public inquiry (a) Any dispute may be referred to a Board of Inquiry with the agreement of both sides. (b) Neither side shall take industrial action during the course of the inquiry. (c) Where either side has taken industrial action before reference of the dispute to a Board of Inquiry (this refers to cases where the procedures laid down by the present Code have been adhered to) every effort will be made to suspend such action Nevertheless such industrial action will not be a reason for not conducting the inquiry. B. Procedure for the settlement of grievances \u2018Grievance\u2019, means a dispute arising from the interpretation and/or implementation of an existing collective agreement or of existing conditions of employment or arising from a personal complaint including a complaint over a dismissal. Subject to the provisions of Part I, Chapter B. 5, 6 and 7 of the present Code, the procedure for the settlement of grievances will be as follows: 1. Direct negotiations (a) Grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of a collective agreement (i) The grievance should be presented to the employer by the union in writing. Provided that if machinery for the settlement of grievances exists in the undertaking concerned, the procedure envisaged by such machinery should be followed. (ii) Representatives of the Trade Union and employers\u2019 association concerned and/or of the Cyprus Employers\u2019 Federation may participate in the discussion of a grievance. (b) Personal complaints (i) The complaint should be presented in the first instance by the employee to his immediate supervisor/foreman. (ii) If the complaint is not settled at level (i) above or if the complaint is of such nature that direct discussion between the employee concerned and his immediate supervisor/foreman is not considered appropriate the employee has the right to demand that his complaint may be examined at one or more higher levels, depending on the nature of the complaint and the structure and size of the undertaking. Provided that if machinery for the settlement of grievances exists in the undertaking concerned the procedure envisaged by such machinery should be followed. Provided further that at every step of examining the complaint there is a real possibility of settling it. (iii) A settlement of a personal complaint achieved at stages (i) or (ii) above may be challenged by the employers\u2019 or workers\u2019 organisations which are signatories to the 76 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "relevant collective agreement as being contrary to the provisions of the said agreement, in which case the procedure specified in para 1 (a) above is followed. (iv) At all steps of the examination of a complaint the employee concerned is entitled to be accompanied, if he so wishes, by a local trade union representative or a trade union official. Similarly, the employer is entitled to be assisted or represented by an official of the relevant employer\u2019s association and/ or of the Cyprus Employers\u2019 Federation. (c) Time limits for discussing grievances The procedure for examining a grievance should be completed within a month at most. (d) Violations of collective agreements If an employer or employee, against a recommendation by the Ministry of Labour, flagrantly violates the provisions of an existing collective agreement, the procedure provided for by this paragraph will not apply and the aggrieved party may resort to any lawful action, including a strike or lock-out, in defence of its interests. 2. Mediation (a) A grievance not settled at the stage of direct negotiations should be submitted either to the Ministry for mediation or to binding arbitration. (b) If the dispute is submitted to the Ministry for mediation the Ministry undertakes to deal with it within a reasonable time and in any case not later than 15 days from the date of submission. If no settlement of the dispute is achieved by the Ministry within 15 days of the date it began dealing with it the dispute should be submitted to binding arbitration. 3. Arbitration (a) If a dispute is submitted to arbitration, the Ministry sees that a mutually accepted arbitrator is appointed within a week of receiving a request to this effect by either side and assists him to carry out his task speedily by providing such facilities as may be requested by him e.g. a conference room, clerical staff and necessary information. (b) The Ministry sees that the arbitrator\u2019s award is issued within 15 days of the last arbitration session; however, in cases concerning dismissals, the award should be issued within three days of the last session. (c) Arbitration costs should be shared equally by the two sides; however, the arbitrator may, in consultation with the Ministry, issue special directions on this matter. This also applies to grievances. (d) Model arbitration rules for the guidance of arbitrators and of all interested parties will be prepared by the Ministry in consultation with the parties to this Code. C. Dismissals Without prejudice to the right of any employee to have recourse to the Industrial Disputes Court, both sides agree on the following procedure: 1. Dismissals for reasons of redundancy (a) The employer should notify the union of his intention to effect dismissals at least two months before the date of the proposed dismissals. In the event of mass dismissals, it is desirable that the notification is given as soon as is practically possible, taking into account the number of employees to be dismissed, the chances of their re-employment, the need to 77 Social dialogue and EMU in Cyprus ",
        "retrain them etc. After the said notification consultations should be carried out with the unions and/or the employees in accordance with the provisions of ILO. Recommendation No. 119. (b) Grievances over dismissals should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible and the time limits prescribed in paragraphs 1 (c) and 2(b) of Part 11.8 will be halved. 2. Making provision for dismissals in collective agreements It is desirable that collective agreements should contain provisions on the issue of dismissals. Part III. Copies of claims and collective agreements The unions undertake to furnish the Ministry with the following: (a) A copy of all claims submitted to employers, to the District Labour Officer if the dispute is of a local nature, with a further copy to the Senior Industrial Relations Officer. In the case of an island-wide dispute only one copy should be sent to the Senior Industrial Relations Officer. (b)Copies of all collective agreements concluded without the assistance of the Ministry as follows: Two copies to the Senior Industrial Relations Officer and one to the District Labour Officer concerned. Part IV. Duration of the present code (a) The present Code comes into force immediately upon signature. The party wishing its modification or termination should give a six-month notice to the other parties and to the Ministry:- Provided that no party can ask for its modification or termination before the lapse of at least two years from the date of signature. (b)From the date of the signature of this Code the provisions of the Basic Agreement of 1962 cease to apply. Signed at the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance, in Nicosia, on 25th April 1977. 78 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "79 What? In the case of Cyprus, the social dialogue can create the conditions towards the achievement of the target of participation in EMU and adoption of the euro, the earliest possible after accession. The fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria is a necessary precondition for EMU and therefore the containment of fiscal deficit within the limit of 3% of GDP is imperative. For 2003, the fiscal deficit of Cyprus is estimated to be around 5% of GDP without any corrective measures. The relatively large share of the tourist sector in Cyprus to GDP unavoidably causes the Cyprus economy to be vulnerable to external shocks. In periods when an external shock takes place, the economic environment deteriorates and tourist arrivals are negatively affected, consequently leading to a reduction of growth rate, tax revenue and ultimately to the increase of fiscal deficit. Why? It is believed that the fulfilment of the criterion for fiscal deficit is a necessary precondition in order to improve macroeconomic stability in the economy. However, currently the fiscal deficit runs high and diverges from the corresponding Maastricht criterion. The reduction of the fiscal deficit will reduce inflationary pressures in the economy and therefore will help the economy to maintain the inflation rate at the core level without, at the same time, pushing interest rates up. Moreover, the containment of the fiscal deficit is expected to improve the investment climate in the economy, while total savings are also estimated to increase. However, to achieve a significant reduction of the fiscal deficit is not the only requirement. What is additionally needed is the reduction of the fiscal deficit to be grounded on a reasonable and feasible fiscal consolidation programme, which will lead to fiscal sustainability. The other Maastricht criteria, such as the inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate and public debt as a ratio to GDP are to a great extent satisfied. When? The fulfilment of the criterion for fiscal deficit is estimated to be accomplished by the end of 2004, based on the implementation of the Fiscal Consolidation Programme. Where? The implementation of the National Development Plan will be promoted through two existing tripartite bodies: the Labour Advisory Body, which is presided over by the Minister of Labour and Social Insurance, and the Economic Advisory Committee, which is presided over by the Minister of Finance. The Labour Advisory Body is the main tripartite body that deals with labour and social issues and there is wide representation from all social partners. The same representation can be found within ANNEX 2 National Development Plan: Towards EMU through social dialogue ",
        "the Economic Advisory Committee, which deals with problems and issues pertaining to the Cyprus economy in general. The Central Bank of Cyprus also participates in the Economic Advisory Committee, a fact that will prove especially helpful since the project focuses on social dialogue and EMU. Who? It is expected that once the National Development Plan is discussed at the abovementioned tripartite committees, the two committees will assign the detailed work to joint tripartite technical committees. These will be jointly presided over by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labour, and will be responsible for reaching specific conclusions and recommendations as to how the fiscal deficit can be reduced so as to achieve convergence with the Maastricht criteria, with the ultimate goal of achieving fiscal macroeconomic sustainability. Which? The members of the tripartite technical committees will be fully supported by specialists and personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance, who in any case will be jointly presiding over these committees. Furthermore, the members of the committees will be supported by their own organisational infrastructures (personnel and research departments of the main employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organisations). 80 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic 81 Jaroslav H\u00e1la, Ale \u2030 Kroupa, Jaroslav Kux, Zde \u00c0 ka Mansfeldov\u00e1 and Petra Raku \u2030 anov\u00e1 Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs, Prague Seeing that the social partners will collaborate on the project \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries\u2019 and that the project as a whole is based on their mutual co-operation, this national report should also be a consensual evaluation of the existing state of affairs. Since co- operation with the social partners in the short amount of time we were allotted for preparing this study would be complicated, the authors took certain conclusions and appraisals (particularly in the \u2018Industrial relations\u2019 and \u2018Conclusion\u2019 sections) from a study that already was a result of consensus on the reality of social dialogue in the Czech Republic (H\u00e1la et al , 2002). The study represents the concluding report of the first component of the 1999 Phare project, \u2018Development of Social Dialogue\u2019. The working draft of the study was completed in December 2001 and then subjected to extensive discussion, both at seminars for project participants and in a meeting with the working team for labour relations, collective bargaining and employment of the Council of Economic and Social Agreement, all of which took place in January 2002. The following month, the study was laid open to comment by the council and also some smaller trade union and employers\u2019 associations, either in the form of interviews with their representatives or in detailed written responses. Other comments were later provided on an unofficial basis, notably from officials from some trade unions. After this debate and the incorporation of the verbal and written comments, the text was completed at the end of 2002 and became a kind of starting point for further action by the project partners. Economic situation Economic development, 1997-2002 Over the last several years, economic development in the Czech Republic has in many ways been contradictory ( see Table 1 overleaf ). On the one hand, the end of the 1990s was dominated by economic recession, with annual falls in gross domestic product of around 1% in 1997 and 1998 (following unprecedented strong GDP growth of 4-6% per year in 1995 and 1996). By the end of the decade the recession turned into stagnation, accompanied by relatively pronounced falls in employment and a gradual sharp rise in unemployment. On the other hand, external economic relations started to improve markedly in this period \u2013 albeit only temporarily \u2013 with a gradual decline in the balance of payments current account deficit from the alarming 7% of GDP in 1996- 1997 to just 2-3% of GDP at the end of the decade. Domestic financial relations were also relatively stable, with low state budget deficits of just 1-1.5% of GDP; overall public budgets were similarly favourable. In many respects, the first years of the new decade have marked a fairly fundamental turning point. In 2000-2002, gross domestic product again started to rise by 2-3% per year, although the rates of growth were gradually falling in individual quarters. The fall in the number of persons employed essentially stopped (with the exception of the year 2002), but with little change to the high rate of unemployment. Wage developments, with real wages growth considerably outstripping productivity growth, have not helped healthy economic development, however, especially in the last two years. External economic as well as inner financial relations worsened: the balance of 2 ",
        "payments current account deficit ended each year with large shortfalls far above 5% of GDP and both state and general public budget deficits increased to 2-3% of GDP every year. One positive feature was the increase in the influx of direct foreign investment \u2013 while the total inflows of foreign investments during the entire economic transformation decade was USD 18 billion, practically the same amount has flowed into the country during just the last three years. Last year alone, foreign investments rose to almost USD 8.5 billion.

Over the last five or six years, similarly ambiguous development can be seen in terms of the criteria for joining EMU. Positive features at the end of the 1990s (and, incidentally, throughout the transformation of the Czech economy after 1990) were very low deficits in the state budget and public budgets in general, combined with the very low public debt, well below the Maastricht criteria, as well as the overall stable national currency situation for the past several years. On the other hand, inflation and the related high interest rates far exceeded the stipulated criteria. The first years of the new decade have brought a fundamental turning point in these terms \u2014 inflation has been considerably suppressed and interest rates have fallen substantially, though not yet sufficiently. On the other hand, the public budgets deficit has risen sharply, considerably increasing the country\u2019s public debt. As regards the national currency situation, the exchange rates can still be regarded as essentially stable, with an overall tendency for the Czech koruna to strengthen. Before going into detail about the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria, it must be stressed that by joining the EU the Czech Republic will automatically take part in the third phase of EMU (i.e. the introduction of the non-cash volume of the single currency and the working of the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) single currency policy, fixing a single interest rate for the entire Eurozone, accompanied by adoption of euro as regular cash currency in the zone in January 2002), though with certain limitations. The Czech Republic will merely acquire the status of Member State, with a temporary exemption for introduction of the euro, i.e. it will not yet be a member of the Eurozone in this phase. However, it will become a member of the ECB\u2019s system. Before introducing the euro, it must meet the Maastricht convergence criteria. From this point of view, the first possible year for launching the euro in the Czech Republic is 2007, but it is more likely to be a little later. However, the Maastricht criteria required for entry to the Eurozone are basically based on the conditions of stabilised developed economies. The Czech Republic is still in the stage of ongoing transformation 82 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "process, where the economic policy priority is achieving economic growth greater than that in the existing member countries as an essential precondition of bringing the economic standard closer to that of EU countries. This goal is not being achieved yet; by contrast, in terms of the overall development of the Czech economic transformation to date GDP per capita has fallen relative to EU countries (from about 70% in 1990 to about 60% today). The restrictive monetary and fiscal policy necessary for meeting the Maastricht criteria would evidently somewhat complicate the process of real convergence. Inflation Table 1, giving macroeconomic indicators of economic development, shows clearly that after a period of high inflation rates in 1997 and 1998 (double-digit inflation before 1995 even), considerable reductions have been achieved. The criterion of 2% annual inflation was first achieved in 1999 and, after some increase in the following two years to 4-5% (largely due to rises in some hitherto regulated prices), inflation again fell below the stipulated level in 2002. The results for the first quarter of 2003 (when there was the first ever incidence of deflation, with consumer prices falling approximately by 0.5% below the level of same period of the previous year) and of the forecasts made suggest that inflation should not exceed 2% in 2003 either. Future development is hard to estimate reliably now, particularly because of measures for the gradual deregulation of the remaining part of rent and other services or rising prices in the remaining regulatory measures and also in consequence of changes in certain indirect taxes on selected goods and services (particularly the gradual unification of value added tax and consumer taxes). Most probably, some increase of inflation in the future can be expected again (according to some forecasts the annual rate of inflation in 2004-2006 could range from 3 to 3.5%). Interest rates There have also been major changes in the area of individual interest rates. While the two-week REPO rate of the Czech National Bank (CNB) was still 14.75% at the end of 1997 and 9.5% at the end of 1998, this centrally fixed interest rate has gradually fallen, surprisingly equalling just 2.5% as of 31.3.2003, and has not differed much from ECB rates. The CNB discount rate is currently just 1.5%, which is essentially the lower limit for interest rate movements on the money market. The size of the minimum mandatory reserves of the commercial banks deposited at CNB is 2% of the prescribed volume of the bank\u2019s resources, in line with ECB measures for EMU central banks (these reserves are bearing interest in the Czech Republic based on the applicable REPO rate, i.e. currently 2.5%). In connection with these CNB measures, the annual interest rates of bank loans and deposits are also falling sharply \u2014 at the end of 2002 the interest rate for loans fell to 5.8% (and as low as 4.3% for new loans) and far below 2% for deposits, from the average 1% for non- term deposits to 2% for term accounts. In the first quarter of 2003, there was a further marked reduction in these rates. As far as the yield rates on CNB bonds are concerned, for short-term bonds up to 1 year these are essentially the same as the applicable REPO rates; with long-term bonds, however, they remain relatively high. To conclude, it is fair to say that despite the reductions achieved in a number of important interest rates, the Czech Republic still does not meet the criteria set for the size of long-term interest rates, characterised in the case of the Czech banking system by the percentage yields of 10-year government bonds. These are currently around 4% (slightly more for bonds issued in 2002, slightly less for bonds issued at the start of 2003), as compared to the 2.5% Maastricht criterion. 83 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic ",
        "Budget deficit Despite the considerable worsening of the state budget results since the start of the new decade, the deficit in both the state and overall public budgets (i.e. including the budgets of local governments and a number of non-budget funds and health insurance company funds), it did not exceed the target 3% of GDP practically up to 2002. Budget deficits continue to increase, however, so just the state budget deficit for 2003 already represents 4.6% of GDP and, given the further expected expenditure not so far reflected in the state budget, may even be around 5% of GDP, while the overall public budgets deficit will evidently reach 6% of GDP. If these trends continue, this deficit could be as much as 7-8% of GDP, according to pessimistic forecasts. The long-discussed need for effective reform of public budgets is thus becoming extremely urgent \u2013 primarily, budget expenditure has to be cut sharply (particularly by reform of the state\u2019s social policy, whose expenditure makes it one of the biggest state budget items) and some taxes (especially indirect taxes) will evidently need to be raised. Besides the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the OECD has also recently been warning about the need to reform budget policy and prevent further increases in the deficit. Public debt Developments in the fulfilment of public budgets have a direct influence on the state\u2019s public debt. The essentially positive development in the implementation of the state and overall public budgets at the end of the 1990s was reflected in relatively low debt levels relative to GDP \u2013 altogether below 15%, compared to the Maastricht criterion limit of 60%. Practically since the start of the new decade, however, the constantly growing public budgets deficit has naturally worsened public debt, which had risen to roughly 20% of GDP by the end of 2002 and is expected to reach 24% of GDP according to the budget for 2003. This is still well below the stipulated limit, but the problem is not the current magnitude of public debt, but the constantly worsening trend. If this public budgets deficit continues to grow (on the assumption that budget reforms are not made or are insufficient), then public debt could rise to as much as 40% of GDP in 2006, according to pessimistic forecasts. That would make it easy for public debt to rise to 60% in the foreseeable future. That would jeopardise the country\u2019s joining the Eurozone on time; a number of experts believe it more likely to happen sometime around 2009/2010 rather than the first possible date of 2007. In any case, the agreements governing the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU also contain a commitment to subsequently \u2014 at an unspecified time \u2014 join the Eurozone, but only on the assumption that the Maastricht criteria are met. That reinforces the urgency of certain public finance reforms. Exchange rate stability The exchange rate stability criterion demands 2-year participation in ERMII and, at least for this period, conformity with the normal agreed exchange rate bracket. The level of central parity and the allowed breadth of the fluctuation band of the Czech currency in ERMII are yet to be agreed with the ECB and European Commission. Seeing that participation in ERMII is merely regarded as a kind of gateway to the Eurozone but does not itself eliminate the risk of exchange rate volatility, staying in ERMII for longer than the minimum 2 years is not thought to be entirely practical for the Czech Republic. The current, insufficiently consolidated system of public finances could have particularly unfavourable consequences during the Czech Republic\u2019s participation in this mechanism, as well as in the first years following Eurozone accession. For a number of years now, the Czech exchange rate is a floating rate determined by the financial market mechanisms, with the possibility of partial central regulation using the familiar indirect mechanisms of CNB (interest rate policy and possibly also intervention on the financial markets). 84 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The present-day situation is essentially one of the long-term trend of a strengthening Czech koruna relative to the euro, to a great extent as a result of the previous euro falls against the dollar. Since the launch of the euro in 1999 as a non-cash accounting currency unit, the Czech koruna exchange rate has gradually strengthened from the average CZK 36.88 that year to the average 30.81 in 2002, i.e. by roughly a fifth in total. At the end of the first quarter, the Czech koruna had weakened somewhat to CZK 31.86/EUR. It will only be possible to evaluate compliance with the respective Maastricht criterion in the context of the ERMII mechanisms, but no marked devaluation tendency is foreseen taking into account the existing situation of the Czech economy. Political situation Political parties In the course of its 10-years of independence, the Czech Republic has become a functioning representative democracy with a fully differentiated power structure. The two-chamber parliament, elected in regular democratic elections by proportional representation (Chamber of Deputies) and with a first-past-the-post system (Senate), carries out the legislative function; the government, headed by the prime minister, carries out the executive function. There have only been extraordinary elections to the Chamber of Deputies once, in 1998, and the government they brought to power saw out its entire 4-year term of office. Thirteen political parties took part in the elections, with 5 exceeding the 5% representation limit. The 2002 elections were again held at the appointed time \u2014 29 political parties took part, with 4 reaching the 5% limit. The increased number of canvassing parties is, among other things, a consequence of the amendment of the electoral act, which removed the duty on canvassing parties to put down an electoral deposit and reduced the limit required for a state contribution for votes from 3% to 1.5%, reducing the risk of financial collapse for parties. Throughout its 10-years\u2019 existence, the Czech party system has encountered falling turnouts (73.9% in 1998, just 58% in 2002), which is a potential threat to the stability of the political system. New parties have emerged in every parliamentary election so far, primarily on the centre right. These parties are usually formed when those dissatisfied with the political parties\u2019 platforms break away. Even so, party fragmentation is low and, compared to the first half of the 1990s, the parliamentary clubs of parties have been stable. Since 1992, the number of parties in parliament has fallen and, with the exception of 1998 (the break-up of a party in the parliamentary arena), no new party has got into parliament. Since the 2002 elections, there have been 5 political parties in parliament, although the Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak Popular Party (KDU- CSL) and the Freedom Union \u2013 Democratic Union (US-DEU) entered parliament as one subject (the Coalition). Immediately after the elections, however, they started to proceed separately and each has its own club of deputies. Representation is broken down as follows: (cid:2) Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD): 35% (cid:2) Civil Democratic Party (ODS): 29% (cid:2) Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM): 20.5% (cid:2) KDU-CSL: 11% (cid:2) US-DEU: 4.5% (as the Coalition 15.5%) At the level of political representation there has been a stabilisation of the political spectrum and a marginalisation of certain non-system parties (the failure of the Party for the Republic \u2013 Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR-RSC) in the 1998 and 2002 elections). One specific case 85 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic ",
        "is the Communist Party (KSCM) \u2013 although it has not undertaken any fundamental internal transformation, the prevailing political constellation has meant that it has gradually come out of isolation and is becoming an active player in the executive (in the 2002 elections it won 18.5% of the vote, compared to 11% in 1998); after the second scrutiny it won 41 of the 200 seats). The political orientation of the population can be described as crystallised and the electorate of the large political parties is relatively stable. Support for smaller parties is endangered by new parties which siphon off votes. One problem in the 1998 and 2002 elections, and in the subsequent formation of a government, was the high personalisation of politics, where personal animosities have been an obstacle to the constitution of a right-wing coalition of parties with closely related manifestos. Government composition and parties,1998-2002 The period under scrutiny started with the formation of a new provisional government (semi- caretaker government) after the collapse of the government coalition in November 1997 and the abdication of the government in December 1997. The goal of this government, which featured 7 non-party independents (out of 16 members), was to continue with the political and economic reforms that had been started and to steer the country to early parliamentary elections in June 1998. These brought the first change of government: after years of a right-wing coalition government a minority social democrat government took power. For 4 years, it was able to rule thanks to a tolerance pact with the strongest opposition party, the former government right-wing Civil Democratic Party (ODS). The social democrats repeated their election victory in 2002, forming a left-right coalition with the Christian and Democratic Union-Czechoslovak Popular Party (KDU-CSL) and the Freedom Union \u2013 Democratic Union (US-DEU). This coalition\u2019s disadvantage is its one-vote majority in parliament (50.5%, minimum size coalition), which places greater demands on party discipline in parliament and on bargaining for support for government legislation. The CSSD, KDU-CSL and US-DEU government coalition of 11:3:3 is united by the shared central point of the political agenda in the near future \u2014 joining the EU. There is disagreement in budget matters particularly, where CSSD is pushing for further increases in the country\u2019s debt. The driving force behind changes in the period under scrutiny has been and is preparation for accession to Euroatlantic structures. In March 1999 the Czech Republic joined NATO; at present the preparations for EU entry are reaching their peak. The regular assessment reports of the European Commission, which have been issued from 1998, have declared considerable progress in the elimination of shortcomings and the filling in of the majority of the gaps that existed in the legislation. In the area of labour and capital, tripartite social dialogue has existed at national level since 1991, involving representatives of employees (the trade unions), employers and the government. Over the more than 10 years of its existence, the institutional form of this dialogue has undergone various changes and the attitude of the ruling parties has also changed. Social partnership has played a role in the transformation process and has also developed in response to the changing political, economic and social conditions and the \u2018maturing\u2019 of the social partners. Relations between the social partners and the state have changed, as have social partnership\u2019s function and organisational form. It was mainly de-nationalisation and privatisation that brought about the 86 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "changes in social partnership. If in the middle of the 1990s, at a time of successful economic reform and continuing privatisation, the right-wing government was reserved in its attitude towards the tripartite mechanism and sought to constrain it, the growing burden of economic problems in 1996- 1997 and the first signs of social unrest drove home the need for social dialogue. The arrival of the social democratic government after the June 1998 elections has meant a generally more favourable situation for social dialogue given the attitude of the Social Democrats as declared in their manifesto. The government also inherited a difficult economic situation, which strengthened its communication with the social partners. So far the government has placed great importance on social dialogue and the social partners welcome this. The government is motivated not just by its manifesto, but also by the preparation for EU entry, which requires important steps to be consulted with the social partners. After taking power, the government started to make use of some new forms of social dialogue at national level in order to involve the broadest possible public, particularly non-government organisations, civic initiatives and independent experts in the preparation of strategies for and legislation on employment, social security, labour relations, etc. Both employers\u2019 associations and the trade unions declare themselves to be independent of the political parties and intend to retain this autonomy. The trade unions continue to avoid allying themselves with any political party, but tend to recruit support for their demands from political parties with a similar outlook. EMU support As mentioned above, the core of the existing government\u2019s political agenda is support for EU entry. Yet the attitudes of the voters of the individual government parties on EU entry differ greatly. Whilst CSSD voters are rather skeptical about the impacts they anticipate from EU entry and expect their standard of living subsequently to fall substantially, US-DEU voters are very optimistic. KDU-CSL voters are less skeptical than CSSD voters, but more skeptical than ODS and US-DEU voters. The electorates of the opposition parties in parliament also have different attitudes. ODS voters are the most optimistic in their expectations, whereas KSCM voters are the most skeptical about the impact of EU accession on their standard of living. Public opinion surveys (Seidlov\u00e1, 2002; Rezkov\u00e1, 2003) allow us to identify two categories of citizens in terms of concerns about EU entry. The first, largest category mentions concerns about negative impacts on their own life \u2014 i.e. rising prices, chiefly foodstuffs, land and power (82%, 76% and 72% respectively). The second category contains those who are concerned about negative impacts on the economy as a whole, including increased unemployment and taxes and concern about lower social benefits (48%, 37% and 22% respectively). The population\u2019s expectations as regards wage developments vary greatly: while 42% of the population expect marked wage growth, 10% expect marked falls in wages and 38% believe that there will be no major changes in wage policy. Besides political attitudes, variables such as age, education and standard of living also exert an influence on citizens\u2019 opinions. Older people and people with a lower standard of education and lower standard of living are generally more concerned about the impacts of the Czech Republic\u2019s joining the EU. These concerns will to a large extent influence the expected turnout in the referendum on EU entry and also the attitude to the single European currency and its introduction 87 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic ",
        "in the Czech Republic. These attitudes have only been monitored in public opinion research since 2001. Advocates of the single European currency have for a long time been in the majority (52% in 2001, 53% in 2002 and 52% in 2003). Most support for the single currency comes from citizens who also support the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU (80%); among the opponents of accession, only 18.6% are for the introduction of the euro. In terms of political party affiliation, the strongest advocates of the introduction of the single European currency are ODS and US-DEU voters (74% and 73% respectively). CSSD and KDU-CSL voters are average in terms of their support (57% and 45% respectively). KSCM voters are the biggest opponents of the introduction of the euro (only 14% of KSCM voters support the adoption of the euro). This view conforms to the party line. The media, which bring information for and against the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU, play a major role in the formation of the population\u2019s opinions. While economic arguments citing the positive influence of the European free market on the domestic economy prevailed in political debate in the first half of the period under scrutiny, the election campaigns of the eurosceptic political parties in the second half of the period were dominated by demands that the economic benefits associated with accession cannot outweigh the loss of national and cultural identity and sovereignty. Opponents of EU accession also mention price stagnation, increasing unemployment and the falling competitiveness of Czech firms as important negative impacts of the marked rise in the price of labour associated with the need to comply with EU regulations. They also argue that free trade between the Czech Republic and the EU can be put in place in another way than joining the EU. Advocates of EU accession counter by citing greater support for small and medium-sized enterprise, the opportunity to make use of the structural funds and better conditions for domestic firms\u2019 access to European markets. It is clear that citizens to a large extent reflect the opinions presented by politicians and the media, while also factoring in their own existing standard of living into their expectations of the impacts. In this context, it should be noted that the government very often justifies price adjustments (e.g. deregulating rent and power prices) on the basis of entry to the EU. Industrial relations Labour law The core piece of legislation governing individual labour relations is the Labour Code, which forms the material-law basis for negotiating collective agreements at enterprise and higher level. The Labour Code was enacted in 1965 as the first codification of labour law in the territory of the Czech Republic. Since then it has been amended almost 30 times. Formerly, these were attempts to accommodate the requirements of central management, since 1990 the conditions of market economy and international treaties or European Community legislation. The best features of this code are its comprehensiveness and clarity. Since 1989 labour law has diversified \u2014 new legislation governing collective labour relations, wage issues, etc. have been taken out of the Labour Code. Labour law today consists of a set of various pieces of legislation (including legal regulations on employment). The last extensive amendment, harmonising labour rules with EU law, implemented by Act no. 155/2000 Coll., is regarded as a significant change to the existing legal 88 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "system and a pronounced success of social dialogue in the Czech Republic, as the social partners at tripartite level played a major role in preparing the act. The overall concept of the Labour Code is unsatisfactory because it was formed in the context of a different socio-economic environment and has been dominated by prescriptive norms rather than dispositional provisions or provisions authorising collective, contract-based regulation. The Labour Code has not yet comes to terms with the overriding constitutional principle that everything is permitted unless expressly forbidden by law. It therefore makes no mention of the possibility of negotiating deviations from the law if contractual parties freely decide to do so. In practice that means that it is only possible to negotiate in collective agreements labour rights above and beyond those set out by law when the Labour Code expressly permits this (in other words, labour rights and duties that the law does not expressly regulate but does not prohibit either cannot be negotiated). That applies to employers carrying on an entrepreneurial business; other employers can make use of this narrow framework only when the act expressly provides so. This restriction on labour rights has been regarded as an obstacle, in terms of both legal theory and the practice of collective bargaining, which fundamentally limits the contractual freedom of the social partners (that does not apply to wage claims, as this has been governed by much more liberal legislation since the start of the transformation period). Trade union organisations The establishment of trade union associations and employers\u2019 organisations or associations thereof is governed mainly by Act no. 83/1990 Coll., on freedom of associations, as amended. Civic associations established under this act are subject to registration with the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic; but, in line with the relevant ILO conventions, trade unions and employers\u2019 associations merely have to register, and state authorities cannot intervene in the establishment and activity of trade union and employers\u2019 organisations. The act does not set out any criteria for representativeness for either trade unions or employers. Soldiers in active service may not join trade unions. A minimum level of 40% representativeness is required by law for trade unions of the police, the fire brigade and customs services. Trade union rights are not governed by a separate law in the Czech Republic; they are regulated by more than one regulation, including generally binding labour regulations. As far as the peak level of trade union association is concerned, after 1989 and after the collapse of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (ROH) several independent trade union confederations were formed. Some of these, especially those with fewer members, associate both legal persons and natural persons. The available data 1 and estimates of representatives of trade union confederations and trade unions indicate that there were probably fewer than 1.2 million employees who were trade union members as of June 2002. According to the Czech Statistical Office, the total number of employees 89 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic 1 The guideline numbers of members of trade union confederations were obtained largely in interviews with their leading representatives. Precise figures tend not to be intended for the public. ",
        "in primary employment in the civil sector was 3,970,000 in the second quarter of 2002. Roughly 30% of all employees in the civil sector were trade union members in 2002. 2 Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (CMKOS) The biggest trade union confederation was established after the Czech and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions was wound up in November 1993. 3 As of June 1995, CMKOS consisted of a total of 36 trade unions with 2.45 million members associated in basic organisations. These trade unions (TUs) have legal subjectivity and have retained most of their powers. Basic TU organisations are formed at the level of enterprises or their organisational units. Some TUs also have local organisations, but these are a minority. Approximately 830,000 members were associated in 31 trade unions in 2002. Most trade unions have falling memberships. Confederation of Art and Culture (KUK) After the collapse of ROH, 19 trade unions of workers in culture, cultural facilities and cultural professions formed their own confederation in February 1990. KUK retained its federative form and continued to include two Slovak trade unions until the year 2000. The Confederation of Art and Culture is based on a purely confederative principle of association of entirely autonomous trade unions, which used their membership of KUK in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement (RHSD) in the Czech Republic up to the year 2000 and in RHSD Slovakia up to 1996 to present and assert their own standpoints at national level. There is a strong principle of professional association among KUK members, where professional interests stand alongside trade union interests. The number of trade union members in KUK is falling. In 2002, approximately 65,000 members were registered in 14 member trade unions and associations, according to leading representatives of KUK. Association of Independent Trade Unions (ASO) This was founded in 1995 by the TU of Workers in Agriculture and Nutrition of Bohemia and Moravia, which left CMKOS that year. By 2002 its membership had grown to approximately 200,000. This growth was mainly caused by the accession of the Railway Workers Trade Union, which left CMKOS in 1998. The larger membership and a change in the RHSD statutes in the year 2000 enabled ASO to take part in tripartite consultations from that year. Despite the said overall growth in membership, the universal tendency of declining trade union membership is also manifest in ASO, according to its representatives. Trade Union Association of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia (OSCMS) This association was established in spring 1991 as the Trade Union Association of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia by the former chairman of ROH, K. Hene \u2030 . OSCMS is close to left-wing parties in orientation (the association has personnel links with the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and it also gives electoral support to this party). It is very critical of government policy. In 1996, it declared 80,000 members in basic organisations, local organisations and professional 90 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 2 In interviews with representatives of the social partners (and not only on the part of employers\u2019 organisations), sceptical comments tend to be made about this figure for trade union membership among employees. It tends to be seen as too high, given the allegedly overstated figures for the number of members given by trade union confederations. On the other hand, the considerable proportion of pensioner trade union members is mentioned in terms of overall trade union membership. 3 The Czech and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions was established in March 1999 after the collapse of ROH and \u2018took over\u2019 its members and (along with the Confederation of Art and Culture) all trade union assets. ",
        "clubs. 4 In 2001, OSCMS had 50,000 members (Draus, 2001). There are around 160 trade union organisations in OSCMS and roughly a quarter of them conduct collective bargaining. 5 Owing to its low membership, OSMCS does not take part in tripartite consultations. Christian Trade Union Coalition (KOK) KOK was founded by staff of the party apparatus of KDU-CSL in 1990. In 2001 it had nearly 15,000 members; membership is now stagnating or even in decline. 6 KOK associates members regardless of their political orientation and religious belief, from all kinds of economic and budgetary organisations, pensioners and individual members. KOK was placed at a material disadvantage when it was formed after trade union assets had been divided up. Primarily KOK lacks the funds for an information and consultation service for basic organisations and to set up a functional administrative apparatus. Since 1997, when it signed a co-operation agreement with CMKOS, KOK has let CMKOS represent it in tripartite consultations. In recent years KOK has regarded this agreement as non-functional. Independent trade unions Besides the aforementioned trade union confederations, there are also a number of independent trade union organisations, which have either been independent since their formation or have split from one of the confederations, particularly CMKOS. These trade unions have a locally or company-based organisational structure. The trade unions are arranged by sector or profession. The exception is the Doctors\u2019 Trade Union Club-Association of Czech Doctors (LOK-SCL), which is a trade union and simultaneously a professional organisation. In 2001, LOK merged with the Association of Czech Doctors and thus greatly increased its membership to 4,800. According to representatives of LOK-CSL, collective agreements are concluded in the majority of hospitals. The category of independent trade unions also includes 5 unions operating on the railways, which have around 15,000 members in total. Independent basic trade union organisations Besides trade unions and trade union confederations, the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s register lists a whole series of trade union organisations registered under Act no. 83/1990 Coll., as amended, without their being members of any trade union or trade union association. These organisations have an independent existence, operating usually within an enterprise and able to bargain collectively. The only overview of these organisations is the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s register. Employers\u2019 organisations After 1989, the new entrepreneurs formed a number of associations representing their emerging specific interests. Their confederations and some of the individual associations are civic associations established under Act no. 83/1990 Coll. A number of entities (e.g. roughly 2/3 of associations 7 that are members of the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic) were established under different legislation (the Civil Code). 91 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic 4 OSCMS internal figure from 10.5.1996. 5 Qualified estimates given by the representative of OSCMS in 2002. 6 KOK internal figure, further also estimates of KOK president, 2002. 7 Internal figure of SP CR. ",
        "Employers\u2019 organisations were formed on a sectoral or professional basis and by type of ownership. Membership of these associations has not changed much over the last years. Instead, there has been some regrouping under umbrella associations. Based on the figures that individual employers\u2019 organisations and their associations have provided, they are estimated to associate a total of 10,000 to 12,000 enterprise subjects and self-employed persons. By comparison, in March 2003 the Czech Statistical Office registered 2,254,000 business subjects, including the self-employed, 31,000 of which had more than 20 employees. Figures for the numbers of employees of firms associated in employers\u2019 organisations also tend to be insufficient. Some sources state that firms associated in entrepreneur associations and confederations thereof employ 1,500,000 employees; these data correspond to the evaluation that employers\u2019 organisations are characterised by low across-the-board representativeness (Draus, 2001). As the majority of statutes of employers\u2019 organisations concur, their mission is to represent, co- ordinate and assert the common entrepreneur and employer interests of their members in co- operation with the state authorities, trade unions, legislative assemblies and other employers\u2019 organisations. They also concentrate on providing services and advice to members and to broker business contacts and economic and technical information. Educational work is also important. They often represent their members\u2019 interests in international employers\u2019 organisations and professional organisations. Confederation of Employer and Entrepreneur Associations (KZPS) KZPS was originally founded as the Co-ordination Council of Employers\u2019 Associations and Federations of the Czech Republic (KORP) in August 1990 to represent business interests in the then Council of Social Agreement. It took on its current name in 1993. At the time KORP associated and represented all business activities in the Czech Republic, both large sector-based entrepreneur associations (e.g. the then Federation of Industry) and smaller private entrepreneurs organised in the Association of Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, as well as various professional groupings. Crystallisation and differentiation of interests as a result of economic and social transformation brought organisational changes \u2013 the biggest member, the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic, left KZPS in 1995. At present it has the following members: the Association of the Textile, Clothing and Leather Industry (ATOK), the Association of Entrepreneurs in Building Industries in the Czech Republic, Czech Confederation of Commerce (SO CR), the Co-operative Association of the Czech Republic (DA CR) (represented in KZPS by the Union of Czech and Moravian Manufacturing Co-operatives (SCMVD)), the Association of Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, the Agricultural Association, the Union of Employers\u2019 Associations of the Czech Republic. KZPS is represented in RHSD bodies. Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic (SP CR) SP CR was founded in 1990. Up to 1995, it was part of KZPS. Its membership comprises individual and collective members (in 2003 84 and 29 members respectively), associated on the basis of sectoral, branch or regional affinity. As of March 2003 SP CR associated 1,617 organisations and firms with almost 600,000 employees ( see http://www.SPCR.cz). One specific feature is the collective membership of professional organisations \u2014 the Czech Management Association, the Association of Mechanical Engineers, the Personnel Managers\u2019 Club of the Czech Republic and the Czech Jewellery and Watchmaker Association. Besides big business, SP CR also represents medium-sized and small enterprises. These interests are represented by the Association of Small 92 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "and Medium-sized Entrepreneurs and Traders of the Czech Republic and the Union of Medium- Sized Businesses, which are collective members of SP CR. SP CR is a member of RHSD. Collective bargaining National level Negotiations on creating a tripartite system began in parallel with the start of economic transformation after 1989. If the necessary reforms related to the transformation from a command economy to market economy were to be implemented successfully, there had to be consensus among all the participating actors. Based on the model in west European democracies, a tripartite body of employers, trade unions and government was set up in 1990. The Council of Social Agreement, later renamed the Council of Economic and Social Agreement (RHSD), was formed at federal level and two national tripartite bodies in each republic (Czechoslovakia was a federative state at the time). The General Agreements signed by the tripartite members were not legally binding from the start: they were gentlemen\u2019s agreements. The tripartite mechanism and its working were not and are not governed by any act or any other regulation. It is based on the principle of good will and consensus between the social partners and the government. According to the RHSD statutes, the representatives of trade unions and employers must satisfy certain criteria. Besides operation at national level and a confederative organisation, employers\u2019 associations had to register at least 500,000 employees and trade union associations at least 300,000 members. The decline in membership meant that the criteria were changed over the years to 200,000 employees for employers and 150,000 members for trade unions. There have always been three partners in RHSD: state, as represented by the government, employers, as represented by the Co-ordination Council of Entrepreneurs\u2019 Associations and Federations of the Czech Republic (later the Confederation of Industry and the Confederation of Employer and Entrepreneur Associations) 8 ; and employees, as represented by trade unions; not by all trade unions, but by the biggest confederation \u2014 the Confederation of Czech and Moravian Trade Unions (CMKOS) and the Confederation of Art and Culture (KUK), which was superseded in the year 2000 by the Association of Independent Trade Unions (ASO), when KUK ceased and ASO started to meet the representativeness criterion. 9 Social dialogue at national level is also taking new forms. After the social democrats came to power the government started to make use of some new forms of social dialogue at national level in order to involve the broadest possible public, particularly non-government organisations, civic initiatives and independent experts in the preparation of strategy and legislation on employment, social security, labour protection, etc. In the last two years the social conference has become such a government platform. Its activity is guaranteed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The mission of the social conference, or social conferences, is currently to discuss prepared decisions 93 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic 8 In 1993 the Co-ordination Council of Entrepreneurs\u2019 Associations and Federations of the Czech Republic changed its name to the Confederation of Entrepreneurs\u2019 and Employers\u2019 Associations, from which the Confederation of Industry split in 1995. 9 KUK\u2019s situation, as far as social dialogue at national level is concerned, thus deteriorated. Even so, for many ministries KUK is still a place of comment, and under the Treaty on Co-operation with the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic (the \u2018Cultural Tripartite System\u2019) KUK is a signatory and guarantor of this social dialogue on the employee side. ",
        "of government and parliament on institutional reform of social financing with the broadest possible participation of concerned subjects. Examples are the 1999 social conference on reform of the social aid system or the year 2000 social conference on pension reform. Another new form of social dialogue is co-operation between the state and social partners in the preparation of labour legislation conducted through \u2018round tables\u2019. Sessions are convened by the appropriate ministry bringing the new legislation and are attended by representatives of the social partners as well as parliamentary deputies from the Committee for Social Policy and Healthcare of the Chamber of Deputies of Parliament of the Czech Republic and experienced specialists. The purpose of the round tables is to draw on the expertise of the broadest possible range of concerned specialists and to gain support for the prepared draft in the interest of its adoption in parliament. This co-operation proved successful in the case of the aforementioned amendment of the Labour Code and other generally binding labour regulations (Kub\u00ednkov\u00e1, 2001). Another new form of social dialogue is the preparation of the State Social Doctrine. Work is organised by a non-governmental association for the development of the theory and practice of social policy ( Socioklub ) in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, universities, research institutes, etc. (Kub\u00ednkov\u00e1, 2001). Another form of social dialogue is participation in the commissions of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate subcommittees, e.g. on pension reform (where debate is broader and involves, for example, representatives of pensioners\u2019 organisations, etc.). Representatives of the social partners can take part in the sessions, which are public, and can demand the right to address the meeting even though they do not have the same status of parliamentary deputies or senators. The new forms of social dialogue do not just affect the social arena; they also cover the entire set of problems associated with EU integration. The executive apparatus of the relevant ministries dealing with the approximation of European law need contact with the social partners and their knowledge of reality. The social partners \u2013 both employers and trade unions \u2013 have representatives in certain departmental commissions dealing with the implementation of European law and norms. \u2018Sectoral\u2019 level and extension mechanism Collective bargaining, as a form of social dialogue between the social partners at supracorporate level that is governed by law, has been conducted since the establishment of institutional partner structures, i.e. since the start of the 1990s. Table 2 shows how the effective scope of higher-level collective agreements (HLCAs) has changed in terms of the number of employees, or trade union member employees, covered by HLCAs. The figures for HLCAs in individual years are only available in this scope for some trade unions associated under CMKOS. 10 The general reason for concluding HLCAs is the need to constitute minimum standards for working conditions. Right from the start, however, the formation of HLCAs has come up against the problem of the legitimacy of the contractual partner on the employer side, or in some cases against the unwillingness of some employers\u2019 representations to bargain collectively. Employers\u2019 associations 94 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 10 Besides the trade unions associated in CMKOS, HLCAs are negotiated (a total of HLCAs) by the Trade Union of Workers in Agriculture and Nutrition \u2013 Association of Independent Trade Unions of the Czech Republic. ",
        "are either not registered as associations within the meaning of Act no. 83/1990 Coll. or their statutes do not empower them to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of their members, or bargain only for a very limited set of members. That naturally means that the number of employees covered by HLCAs is significantly limited. In 2001 and 2002, HLCAs concluded by trade unions in CMKOS applied to just under 19% of all employees in the civil sector. This low proportion of employees covered by HLCAs (compared, for example, to enterprise-level collective agreements which covered approx. 26% of civil sector employees in the same period) exists despite the relatively large-scale use of extension that occurred from 1999 to 2001. The massive extension of HLCAs that took place in these years caused a significant increase in the number of employees covered by HLCAs. This trend was played out even though all the indicators in the table (number of HLCAs concluded, number of trade union organisations and their employees) stagnated or fell. Table 2 Total scope of higher-level collective agreements for CMKOS, 1995-2002 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Number of HLCAs concluded 33 30 30 25 22 22 20 20 Number of trade union organisations covered by HLCAs 2,020 1,946 1,725 1,352 1,347 1,395 1,457 1,467 Total number of employees covered by HLCAs (without extensions) 770,550 730,080 648,079 521,651 584,067 469,249 446,997 459,848 Number of trade union member employees covered by HLCAs 566,887 513,957 432,844 330,855 323,257 272,214 249,528 217,315 Number of employers to which HLCAs were extended 6 0 0 0 399 2,074 3,482 2,881 Number of employees to which HLCAs were extended 174,272 288,314 269,299 Number of employees covered by HLCAs after extension 643,521 735,311 729,147 Source : Report on the results of collective bargaining at higher level in 2001 and 2002, CMKOS, 2001, 2002. Under Section 7 of Act no. 2/1991 Coll., on collective bargaining, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may issue a regulation stipulating that a higher-level collective agreement is binding for employers who are not members of the employer organisation that signed the agreement. The act does not prescribe a duty for the Ministry to extend a particular HLCA. It is the Ministry\u2019s, or the minister\u2019s, attitude that is decisive. That was shown most clearly from 1996 to 1998. Although a total of 55 HLCAs were signed in this period, not one was extended. HLCAs can only be extended to employers with an equivalent activity and equivalent economic and social conditions if these employers are not covered by another HLCA. These general principles are basically all the law says about extending HLCAs. There is no legislation setting out the extension of HLCAs in greater detail, including procedural particulars. It was only implementation practice, accompanied since the start of application of the act in 1991 practically to this day by debate between the social partners 11 , in the political sphere and among legal experts, that brought any concretisation of the goals, process, subject or target groups of extension. In 1998 the Council of Economic and Social Agreement adopted a binding procedure for HLCA extension. According to this methodological platform, extension of HLCAs is intended chiefly: 95 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic 11 The extension of HLCAs is negotiated in a parity-based commission that works as an advisory body to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. ",
        "(cid:2) to eliminate the palpably disadvantageous social situation of employees whose employees are not members of an employer organisation that has signed a HLCA; (cid:2) to eliminate the economically unequal position of employers who are members of an employer organisation that signed a HLCA relative to employers who are not members and therefore enjoy more advantageous economic conditions for business. All these, and possibly other problematic aspects point to the central problem of the system as a whole, which consists in the definition of the set of employers to which HLCAs can be extended. At present the methodology agreed between the social partners and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs apply \u2013 these are based on the criterion of the employer\u2019s dominant activity as per OKEC (the sectoral classification of economic activities analogy with NACE) and the minimum level of the number of employees fixed differently for employers in individual branches, under which level HLCAs cannot be extended to an employer. The consistent use of the sectoral framework is a problem for the extension of HLCAs, as sectors or branches are not reliably defined enough for practical use. Employers may adjust their classification according to OKEC in connection with the extension of HLCAs. This methodology is no substitute for assessment of employers\u2019 socioeconomic conditions on a case-by-case basis. The construction of the collective bargaining act, which does not mention sectoral collective agreements as such, also causes difficulties. Company level Collective bargaining on the signing of an enterprise-level collective agreement (ELCA) represents the most important form of social dialogue at company level, in terms of both its scope in the current conditions in the Czech Republic and, most notably, its actual influence on the quality of working conditions. ELCAs concluded in the given period run into the thousands \u2013 in this sense, as well as in terms of the numbers of employees covered by collective agreements, ELCAs prevail over HLCAs. The significance of ELCAs is naturally also a consequence of their accessibility for users and thus their direct effect in the context of a specific corporate environment, as well as the relative ease of their evaluation and the monitoring of commitments. Detailed data 12 on the extent of collective bargaining at company level are only available for the biggest trade union confederation, CMKOS ( see Table 3 in Annex 1 ). 13 These figures indicate that both the number of employers at whose enterprises a basic trade union organisation operates and the number of ELCAs 14 concluded have fallen every year. The exception was 1995, when there was a slight increase in the number of employers and a marked rise in the number of ELCAs signed. A small increase in the number of ELCAs signed was also registered in 2002. With small differences, particularly in 1999 and 2002, the same trend also applied to the overall number of employees covered by ELCAs. 96 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 12 Besides CMKOS, which can supply detailed figures, we know the approximate numbers of ECLAs concluded, e.g. for OSPZV-ASO, which concludes the most ECLAs in ASO (around 800 a year according to the ASO secretary); KUK mentions 100 ECLAs (figure stated by the president of KUK as a comment on this study). KOK estimates that around 40 member organisations bargain collectively; the figure for OSCMS is similar (estimates of the representatives of these trade union confederations provided during the comments process on this study). Of course, that does not account for all the ECLAs concluded in the Czech Republic. 13 We take the data on ECLAs from the \u2018Report on Collective Bargaining at Company Level in 2001\u2019 and the same report for 2002, which summarise the results of CMKOS research into wages and working conditions negotiated in ECLAs for 2001 and 2002. 14 Part of the decline (roughly 650 ECLAs) is caused by the departure of certain trade unions from CMKOS. ",
        "A somewhat more favourable balance in terms of the extent of collective bargaining at company level was recorded in small (up to 50 employees) and medium-sized firms (from 51 to 100 employees). In 1999 and 2000, these two subcategories registered a marked year-on-year growth in the number of ELCAs, but this is first and foremost a consequence of the overall increase in the number of employers in these size categories. Developments in the most important area of collective bargaining, i.e. remuneration and wages, are alarming. The aforementioned CMKOS data show that the number of employees receiving wages on the basis of a collective agreement is falling faster than the other basic parameters of collective bargaining in the private sector. One measure of the trade unions\u2019 success is the number of trade union bodies that managed to conclude an ECLA. Against the backdrop of the constantly falling success of collective bargaining at enterprise level, the fact that the rate of decline in the proportion of trade union bodies that signed ECLAs is slower than the overall decline in the number of trade union organisations operating in companies (as the CMKOS show) should be regarded as favourable. Social dialogue to support EMU convergence process In 1995, the accession treaty between the European Union and the Czech Republic came into force and preparation of the legal and institutional conditions for EU entry started. In this context, an RHSD team for European integration was established. According to Kub\u00ednkov\u00e1 (2001): \u2018Since 1998, all important measures related to the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the European Union and affecting employees\u2019 interests have been discussed by this working team. This team\u2019s prestige is enhanced by the fact that it is headed by Mr P. Teli \u00e3 ka, first deputy to the minister of foreign affairs and the Czech Republic\u2019s chief negotiator on accession. Conclusions from the sessions of this working team are regularly discussed at plenary sessions of the Council of Economic and Social Agreement. This gives the social partners the opportunity to discuss matters as important as the harmonisation of legislation, the restructuring of the steel industry or tax policy. Of particular importance are its opinions on the free movement of employees, where both sides, the trade unions and employers, have put strong pressure on the government to demand categorically that employees will enjoy freedom of movement right from the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the European Union. Besides this, the importance of the said new forms of social dialogue does not just affect the social arena, but rather the entire set of problems associated with EU entry. In the year 2000, the board of directors of RHSD appointed a working group to negotiate the conclusion of a General Agreement for 2000. The conclusions were negative. Rychl \u02d8 (2000) states, \u2018Opinions on the practicality of an agreement between the government and social partners, and especially on the nature of the agreement, were not uniform. The opinion that, instead of a general agreement for one year, a longer-term social pact with a more general, strategic form could be discussed won some support\u2019. A similar strategic document with defined goals and the means for achieving them in terms of the economy, employment and working conditions, signed by the social partners, could be another important asset that would help cope with the convergence process. 97 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic ",
        "Conclusion This study is the introduction to a project that focuses on the use of social dialogue as the acceding countries prepare to join the economic and currency union. The study\u2019s aim was to provide a concise description and evaluation of, among other things, the state of social dialogue, particularly from the point of view of the competency of the employers and trade unions, and to appraise the entire mechanism of social dialogue at national, sectoral and corporate level. In connection with this study, some experts from the social partners point out that evaluating accession to the euro solely on the basis of the Maastricht criteria and candidates\u2019 ability to meet these criteria is superficial. The question of the achievement of these criteria should be placed in the broader context of the approximation of Central and Eastern European acceding/candidate states with EU states, i.e. in the context of the development trends of the domestic and world economies, particularly as these states are still in the transformation process (Fassmann, 2003). As far as the state of social dialogue and its mechanisms in the Czech Republic are concerned, it must be said that social dialogue in the Czech Republic, unlike in other states, has not yet successfully become a source of law and is not fully integrated as an important factor in the labour market. Although it played an important role in the transformation period, \u2018it is not taken for granted as a tool for mediating between various interests in society\u2019 and there is also \u2018limited public involvement and the low awareness of social dialogue\u2019 (Lubanski, 2002). One system-related shortcoming of social dialogue at national level (as conducted chiefly in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement) is the absence of clearly defined goals. No General Agreement or other document defining economic and social tasks and the framework for macroeconomic and social development in the Czech Republic has been signed since the middle of the 1990s. There is no strengthening of the ties to social dialogue at sectoral and corporate level and the opportunities for using the national tripartite mechanism to implement social dialogue at these levels are not taken up. These opportunities include the definition of targets for wage developments and employment and concluding framework agreements to steer the behaviour of representative bodies and the social partners in companies. Collective bargaining at the level of trade union confederations and employer federations and associations is seen as the least developed subsystem of social dialogue in the Czech Republic. One frequent problem is the absence (on the part of employers) of subjects qualified to bargain or their unclear authority to bargain collectively (i.e. the lack of authorisation or the fundamental restriction of such authorisation to specific members, the need to renew this authorisation, etc.). Trade unions in the state administration in particular cannot conclude higher-level collective agreements because they have no counterpart for collective bargaining, as the law does not enable the state authorities to form employers\u2019 associations. Higher-level collective agreements apply to a very limited number of employees and the applicable legislation does not contain any concept of collective agreements applying to an entire sector. At corporate level the number of employees covered by enterprise-level collective agreements is falling, as is the number of employees paid on the basis of a collective agreement. For social dialogue to develop in the Czech Republic, a new Labour Code and other related legislation need to be adopted. The collective bargaining act will evidently also need amending 98 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "(unless collective labour relations become part of the new Labour Code), e.g. defining the procedure for extending higher-level collective agreements and considering whether to include a requirement for some degree of representativeness of higher-level collective agreements as a condition for extension. 99 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic ",

        "103 In the referendum of 13 and 14 June 2003, Czechs voted in favour of the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU. This outcome made the issue of the country\u2019s preparations for joining EMU even more pressing. That is particularly significant in a situation where continuation of the hitherto unfavourable developments in public finances appears to be unsustainable from the point of view of the socio-economic future of the nation. It seems that most of Czech society no longer has any doubt that there must whatever the case be a fundamental change in the state\u2019s approach to public expenditure, owing to the immediate and incontestable necessity to stop growing internal debt, as well as the need to meet the Maastricht criteria. In this context, the contest surrounding the reform of public finances, and the scale and nature of the reform, is starting to escalate and is gradually becoming a matter for all of society. The government has already approved the budget target for the reform. The public budgets deficit should gradually fall from this year\u2019s over 6% of gross domestic product to 4% of GDP in 2006. The government has also reached agreement on questions of the concept, principles and overall form of reform measures and has approved the reform. The concept of the reform lies in the application of a broad range of relatively interconnected and mostly strategically important changes, but changes which will be socially and politically difficult to push through. The greatest economic expectations are linked to savings in mandatory (legislatively required) state budget expenditure concerning the social area first and foremost. The existing coalition government, which is the initiator and expected implementer of the reform, is in a difficult position. On the one hand it has already made it clear to the public that it qualifies its further existence on successful application of the prepared reform. On the other hand it faces political opposition, both within its own ranks and among the opposition parties in parliament. One very unfavourable factor in the public expenditure reform question is the current opposition from the social partners, particularly the trade unions, which has led to a growing wave of demonstrations and strikes. Social concord in society is under real threat. That is, of course, an entirely undesirable development, especially when we consider that, in contrast to the hitherto accommodating attitude of the government towards social dialogue and the social partners when tackling other strategic and legislative problems, when the existing cabinet proceeded in consensus with the social partners, in the case of the reform the tripartite mechanism was not made sufficient use of and a confrontational attitude has prevailed. In our opinion, however, for the reform to be approved by the majority of civic society, and therefore to succeed over the longer term, the essential point is whether and to what extent the government can still use, and possibly even increase, the effectiveness of the existing platform and structures for social dialogue at national level in favour of reform. That means whether the intended reform measures win and retain the support of the social partners represented in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement. In this context, we hark back to the significant, perhaps even crucial, role of tripartite consultations and social dialogue in maintaining social concord and securing economic development during the past transformation period. Annex 2 National Development Plan: Strengthening social dialogue to support the reform of public finances ",
        "What to develop? In our opinion, the fundamental precondition for the successful course of public finance reform in the Czech Republic is generating framework consensus in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement, with the understanding that the government will of course retain, and possibly even strengthen, its initiatory role. That means, however, that the government will first and foremost make consistent and systematic use of this platform. Not even that might be sufficient for gaining stable support from the social partners in the tripartite arena, however. There have been findings (the conclusions of the recent Phare twinning project on social dialogue in the Czech Republic), shared by the social partners, indicating that the national tripartite mechanism in its current form has some shortcomings limiting its effectiveness. In that case, not even a relatively functional platform, which the social partners and government currently have at their disposal, need necessarily have the capacity to guarantee that the government\u2019s strategic socio-economic projects enjoy stable support. One of the weaknesses of the social dialogue system at national level is the fact that the inception, content and working of the tripartite bodies was not and is still not regulated by law \u2013 it is based on the principle of free will and agreement between the social partners and government. The lack of a binding legal framework opens up considerable room for the social dialogue system\u2019s potential dependency on the political regime, in contrast to most EU Member States. It is also marred by the absence of clearly defined goals for social dialogue at national level, owing to the fact that no General Agreement, or any other fundamental joint document defining relevant economic and social tasks and the framework for macroeconomic and social development in the Czech Republic, has been concluded since the mid-1990s. Another shortcoming is that the ties between national tripartite dialogue and social dialogue at sectoral and enterprise level are not being strengthened and the possibility of asserting social dialogue at these levels through the national tripartite platform (e.g. by defining goals for wage development and employment and by concluding framework agreements steering the behaviour of the social partners at sectoral and enterprise level) is not being used. Another significant problem of social dialogue at national level is the representativeness of the representatives of the individual sides. This problem is intensified by the pressure to open up the trade union delegation to other trade union organisations. Applying representativeness criteria, especially a minimum number of members, ultimately leads to the exclusion of certain influential trade union confederations (the Confederation of Art and Culture). The main aim of the submitted plan is therefore to raise the question of tackling the two processes in conjunction with each other, i.e. strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the national tripartite platform and gaining the social partners\u2019 stable support for all components of the reform of public expenditure. The conclusion of a social pact between the government and social partners on the concept of the reform and the conditions for its support, covering at least the period from 2003 to 2006 in the first phase, should be regarded as an instrument that should be used to steer the tripartite arena towards effective and stable support for reform. When (Implementation time scale)? Given the potentially serious political, social and economic consequences, including the preparation of the state budget and legislating for priority reform measures, the content of the reform must be finalised without delay and it is necessary, in collaboration with the social partners, to formulate the relevant document defining the intended tripartite social pact. 104 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Why (Substantiation)? The submitted National Development Plan seeks to redirect hitherto developments seeking to implement public expenditure reform against the will of the social partners, in the sense of achieving social consensus with the reform and maintaining social concord while the reform measures are in effect. Who (Responsibility)? In the same way as the government alone is not responsible for developments to date in connection with the preparation and adoption of public finance reform, with the social partners also sharing the burden of responsibility to society, all members of the Council of Economic and Social Agreement, or future signatories of the said Social Pact, are jointly responsible for implementing the National Development Plan. Where (Role of national tripartite platform)? It follows from the nature of the National Development Plan that the national tripartite actors will oversee implementation of the plan\u2019s proposed measures in line with the roles they play in this social dialogue platform. Which (Resources)? Implementing the National Development Plan will not necessitate any costs of a material or financial nature and essentially does not, therefore, require any disposable material or financial resources. 105 Social dialogue and EMU in the Czech Republic ",

        "Kaia Philips and Raoul Eamets, University of Tartu The aim of this paper is to give a general overview of the present situation and possible future development of social dialogue in Estonia. The paper is structured as follows: the first section gives a general overview of political development during 1995-2002 in Estonia, and the following two sections describe respectively Estonian economic development and trends in the labour market. The fourth section gives an overview of social partners in Estonia and the final section describes the development of collective bargaining in Estonia. Political situation In 1995, Estonia marked four years of independence. The period of singing revolution, monetary reform, nationalist movement, wild market economy and withdrawing Russian troops was over. During these four years, 28 political parties were introduced but mainly only right conservative governments (mainly Pro Patria leaded by Mart Laar) were formed. Independence was secured but social, rural and national policies were quite underdeveloped. Together with the need to develop towards western values it led to political change at the beginning of 1995. New key issues and priorities in political process were: (cid:2) Joining the main international organisations like WTO, EU and NATO; (cid:2) Creating peaceful relations with Russia; (cid:2) Reforming social security model; (cid:2) Ongoing privatisation; (cid:2) Creating a balanced party system; (cid:2) Judicial and institutional reforms. 1995-1999 New, more moderate and left central parties (Coalition Party, Centre Party) gained support in elections. Because of the large number of parties and opposing interests, mainly minority governments were holding office during 1996-1999. Prime ministers were from coalition party and were presenting the so-called \u2018social market economy model\u2019. On 28 November 1995 Estonia presented its membership application to EU and was chosen for the first wave of membership negotiation, which started in 1998. Closer partnership with NATO started in 1995 by joining PfP planning and review process. Relations with Russia however remained frozen because of Russian new \u2018near abroad\u2019 doctrine and Estonian unwillingness to make compromises in citizenship policy. 1999-2002 Centre Party dominated elections; however right-wing parties formed a coalition. New priorities were: (cid:2) Promote economic growth; (cid:2) Join NATO and the EU; (cid:2) Improve administrative capacity and lawmaking; (cid:2) Finalize privatisation. The first cabinet, which was formed by Mart Laar, held office almost 3 years and implemented politically conservative but economically liberal politics. The biggest failure was unsuccessful administrative reform. The second cabinet was formed by Reform Party leader Siim Kallas (former Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia 107 3 ",
        "foreign minister and president of Estonian Bank) in coalition with the Centre Party. With very little in common in political programmes the main purpose of left and right radical coalition was to hold office until next elections in spring 2003. The public support for ruling coalition and elected president Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel (former first Secretary of the Estonian Communist Party) was very high. Economic development Estonia is considered as one of the most advanced emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe. Owing to rapid economic development, a liberal taxation system and a highly favourable location, the country is at the heart of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing market, the Baltic Sea Region, which has a combined population of more than 90 million people.

First, Estonia experienced more trade shocks, due to a high dependence on energy imports and due to relatively lower energy prices which prevailing in the FSU compared to CEE. 1 Second, as a small country, it was more affected by the collapse of trade, which hit all economies in transition (again Russia would have been least affected). Third, in spite of having been relatively reformist and within the FSU, Estonia probably inherited more distorted economy than, say, Poland or Hungary, which had introduced some market elements during the previous decades. Almost the only sense in which the Estonia had better initial conditions was their start 108 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 1 Saavalainen (1995) reports that in 1992, these terms of trade shock were on the order of 10% Estonia, as compared to 3 to 5.5% in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. ",
        "from a position of zero foreign debt, as Russia took over all of the foreign assets and liabilities of the FSU. Poor starting conditions led Estonia and the other two Baltic states to greater falls in output than in most CEE countries (see Figure 1). The deepest annual decline of GDP was in Latvia (-34.9%), followed by Lithuania (-21.3%) and Estonia (-14.2%) in 1992. In comparison, Poland\u2019s GDP decline after one year of reforms (in 1990), was 11.6%. By OECD estimates, all three of the Baltic States had restored growth in 1996, with the higher Estonian rate partly reflecting the fact that it turned around faster. Figure 1 Real GDP growth in CEE countries (annual growth rates, %) Source: Eamets and Arro, 2000. A fall in economic output is typical of an early transition period. According to Allen (1992), the main sources of output decline, common to transition economies, are as follows: 1. The implementation of structural changes. The experience of the IMF has shown that deep structural adjustment is almost invariably accompanied by a certain retrenchment in production. 2. The shift from the pattern of holding stocks of input as a precaution against disruptions in supply to holding stocks of output so that customer demand may be met. This is a fundamental part of the process of transition from a supply-constrained to a demand-constrained economy. When it occurs, it inevitably causes output losses as firms run up against the demand barrier for their production. 3. The decline in output has been partly explained as the result of a breakdown of plan discipline. While the planned economy did not work well, its elimination has made the co-ordination of economic activities more difficult. This is a temporary phenomenon. 109 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia -40 -35 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 05 10 15 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Estonia Latvia Bulgaria Lithuania Poland Romania Slovakia Czech Hungary ",
        "There are many other possible explanations for economic decline in the transition phase. Some have argued that the magnitude of the decline has been overstated by official statistics, either because their coverage excludes all or part of the growing private sector or simply because, beginning from an initial situation of widespread shortages, standard price and quantity indices generally overstate the drop in output and the increase in the price level associated with price liberalisation. Such explanations do not, however, claim that the decline in output is entirely an artifact of official statistics. Some economists have viewed the output decline as being related to the price shock that followed economic liberalisation. This demand-side view would argue that the decline in real wages, money, and credit is associated with the inflation depressed domestic absorption and thereby contributed to the decline in output. (Borensztein, Ostry; 1995) Other demand-side effect might include a high real interest rate and a change in foreign trade (collapse of trade relations with CIS countries as in Estonia\u2019s case). A supply-side view would characterise the output decline as a result of the increased input prices (energy, oil). After the price shock Estonia was faced with a new relative price structure and one would expect that, over a period of time, resources would flow towards sectors where relative output prices had risen and away from other sectors. A comparative advantage would imply that, if the country faced world market prices for its inputs and outputs, resources would move towards those sectors where comparative costs were lowest, thereby increasing the value of goods and services. During the transition period, when production factors will be reallocated, structural change might be associated with output decline. A very high growth rate in 1997 indicates that the Estonian economy has almost fully recovered from previous supply shocks and high growth rate even caused discussion in the local media about overheating of the Estonian economy. According to the data of economic performance in 1998, the growth of GDP slowed down. The main reasons were the financial recession caused by the stock market crash in October 1997 and the crises in the world financial markets. The Russian economic collapse of summer 1998 has also contributed to the slow down of the Estonian economy, this continues throughout 1999. Estonian Statistical Office reported 1.3% of decline of GDP in 1999. This recession caused external macro shocks and showed clearly how vulnerable is the small-scale Estonian open economy to world market influences. From the second part of 1999, the economy had already started to recover and the recovery continued during 2000. The real GDP growth rate for 2000 was 6.5%. At the same time, labour market indicators did not show any improvement at the beginning of 2000. We believe that one reason for this is on account of technological changes that took place during the restructuring of enterprises affected by the Russian crisis. Inflation The Estonian Government and Bank of Estonia closely cooperate with the IMF and the framework of economic reform has been worked out with advisors from the IMF and EBRD. Most open sector prices were liberalised in Estonia in 1991-1992 and the monthly inflation rate declined from 20% in the summer of 1992 to 6.6% in September 1992 and to 1.7% in May 1993. Annual inflation has been brought down from hyperinflation in 1992 (annual rates of 1076% in Estonia) to 11% in 1997. 110 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "This is in contrast to the CIS, where inflation remains much higher 2 . In 1998, Estonia reached with its inflation rate to single digit number (8.4%) and according to the Estonian Statistical Office the annual inflation rate in 1999 was only 3.4% and 4% in 2000. Inflation in 2001 was 5.6%. Relatively high inflation had not much influence on the labour market in the first year of transition, because the currency board system helped to stop hyperinflation rather quickly in 1992. During the currency reform the Estonian currency ( Eesti kroon \u2013 EEK) was undervalued. This gave enough space for price increases in the conditions of fixed exchange rate. The undervaluation of the kroon made Estonian goods competitive in international markets and helped firms to find new markets. Fiscal policy and debt The role of fiscal policy became crucial in 1997-1998. By the spring of 1997, current account deficit exceeded 14% of GDP, and the domestic credit growth was over 70%. Under these circumstances, the government made a decision to raise the public savings as much as possible. This brought along a drastic change: in the first quarter of 1997 the general government budget was practically balanced, reaching a surplus of 5% of GDP in the third quarter and more that 2% of GDP in the fourth quarter. The overall annual surplus of over 2% GDP was generated in the second half of the year (Bank of Estonia, 1999). During the period of surplus generating fiscal policy the Stabilisation Reserve Fund abroad served the aim of reducing domestic demand and sustaining foreign investor confidence in economic policy. In 1999, the budget was based on far too optimistic assumptions, including 6% GDP growth, while actually GDP declined 1.4 %. As the result the government budget deficit as the share of GDP was 4.7% in 1999, and Government was forced to cut expenditures during the budget year. In 2000, state budget deficit was 0.7% of GDP which indicates that Estonia is able to keep balanced budget. The balanced budget helps to keep state expenditure under control and Estonia already fulfils Maastricht criteria for those who want to join Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This gives a lot of credibility to Estonia in the course of accession negotiations. From the other point of view such restrictive fiscal policy does not enable to government to implement long-run policy planning. This is especially important if we consider long-term planning of social policy issues, such as pension reform for example. Estonia has one big advantage compared with other CEE countries. As mentioned above, Estonia like other Baltic states, did not take over foreign loans of former Soviet Union. That means they started transition period without any foreign dept. Estonian Government has launched very conservative borrowing policy. Total foreign debt of Government is very low (~ 4% of GDP in Dec. 2001). Foreign loans came to Estonia via private sector, mostly through banking sector. Money markets Estonia was the first country of the FSU to leave the rouble zone. Currency reform based on the currency board system was introduced in mid 1992 3 . The Estonian kroon was fully guaranteed by the Bank of Estonian\u2019s foreign reserves and the Estonian kroon was pegged to the German mark at a rate 1 DEM=8 EEK. From January 1999 EEK is pegged to EUR (1 EUR=15.646 EEK). Because Estonian kroon was under-valuated at the moment of creation, Estonia has managed to keep the exchange rate unchanged during whole transition, despite relatively high inflation. Estonian kroon 111 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia 2 According to EBRD estimates average inflation rates in CIS was 33% (Transition,1997). 3 For more details about currency board system, see Schuler (1998). ",
        "has undergone a significant real appreciation since the start of monetary reforms in June 1992. Measured in US dollars, the level of the CPI had by June 1995 grown 4.5 times and this translates into average annual increases in dollar prices of 65% in Estonia. Yet, in spite of massive real appreciation, exports have expanded rapidly. Estonia\u2019s economy is characterised by the convertibility of the national currency. Estonia has abolished all restrictions on capital movements and foreign exchange accounts. In Estonia, the Bank of Estonia is responsible for maintaining the Currency Board system. Due to limits on the use of monetary policy instruments the main tools are regulations for commercial banks and the supervision of commercial banks. The Estonian banking system was in crisis at the end of 1992. Banks failed to carry out their creditors\u2019 orders. At the end of 1992, the three biggest commercial banks were placed under administration by the Bank of Estonia. Later the biggest commercial bank, Tartu Commercial Bank, was liquidated. After the banking crisis the Bank of Estonia strengthened its supervisory activities and tightened regulations concerning the capital adequacy ratio, banks\u2019 minimum capital requirement etc. As a result, these measures, together with general economic developments, helped to strengthen the banking sector. In 1991, there were more than 40 commercial banks; the number declined to 7 by the end of 2001. Crises in the banking sector have finally strengthened and increased the credibility of the Estonian economy. Firms and households have much more trust in financial transactions compared with some other CEE countries, because number of banks has declined and a majority of them consists of commercial banks, which are owned by large Scandinavian banks. A stable financial situation enables households and firms to make more long-term plans and the labour market becomes more stable. Because of the currency board system, the Bank of Estonia does not have the right to increase money supply without increasing central bank reserves. In the Estonian case, we can see that the crises in financial markets in 1997 caused sharp increases in interest rates. Increase of interest rates has caused a decline of aggregate demand (because both consumption and investments have declined) and also it means that the inflow of foreign capital has slowed down. Money supply has declined as well. Attractiveness of the Estonian economy has decreased. All these factors together have caused a decline in imports, which may balance the trade deficit. Estonian money markets are, through interest rates, greatly influenced by activities in European financial markets. The trend in the money market interests rates of the kroon that develops Estonian monetary policy environment is on a downward glide path like that of the euro\u2019s interest rates since the beginning of 2001. 3-month aggregate interest rate \u2013 Talibor - was 4,25% and 6- month Talibor was 4,5% in December 2001. Labour market developments General trends in labour market during 1989-2001 As in most other transition economies of Eastern Europe, the size of the population in Estonia fell rather sharply in the early 1990s, and it continued to decline in the late 1990s, but more moderately. The decline reflects both negative natural increase of population and negative net migration. At the same time, the Estonian population aged quite substantially over the whole last decade, with a particularly large drop in the percentage of people younger than 15-years old. Political, economic and social reforms have completely reshaped the labour markets of all the transition countries. The immediate reaction to economic uncertainty was a sharp decline in 112 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "demand for labour. External shocks as the break-up of the USSR and the collapse of the common market of the former Eastern block occurred during the same period as internal shocks caused by economic reform and stabilization programmes. This combination resulted in sharp production losses and pulled economy into a dragging transition crises. Following the pattern in most other East-European economies, the activity rate (labour force participation rate) declined sharply. There are some differences in variation in labour force participation and employment rates across gender and age groups. In Estonia, the decline in participation was greatest for the age groups 15-19, 35- 39 and 45-49 years old, while the oldest groups of 60-64 and 65+ increase their participation (this increase was equal for men and women aged 60-64, but it consisted entirely of women in the 65+ age group). In recent years, the Estonian labour market has experienced several serious shifts. Mainly due to the economic crises in Russia, the number of the employed fell significantly, by more than 27 thousand people in 1999. The trend continued also in 2000, although to a lesser degree. Simultaneously, unemployment started to increase, peaking in the 1 st quarter of 2000, when the unemployment rate in the age group 15-74 reached a record high of 14.8% (96,7 thousand people). The number of inactive people exceeded 336 thousand in the 1 st quarter of 1999 for the first time, and has decreased thereafter. There was an improvement in labour market in 2001 and this is continuing also in 2002.The dynamics of main labour market indicators are presented in Table 2.

Source: ELFS data, Statistical Office of Estonia. The employment rate among 15-69 years old that had remained stable at 61% in 1995-1998 fell to 58% in 2001. The decrease affected both men and women. Employment rate among men fell to 62.8% and among women to 53.8%. In the second half of 2000 some positive tendencies could be observed though; the employment rate and labour force participation increased and the number of the unemployed and inactive people decreased slightly as compared to the beginning of the year. Despite economic growth in 2000, the number of employed people dropped by approximately 1% compared to 1999, and unemployment grew by 12%. The main reason for lower employment lies in the increase of productivity from corporate restructuring and switchover to capital-intensive production. The transition process brought fundamental changes to the composition of employment by sectors and by branches. Most dramatic decline of agricultural employment took place in Estonia, when compared with other transition countries. Total employment in agriculture dropped from 140 113 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "thousand in 1989 to nearly 40 thousand in 2001. A decline in the range of 70% is a very serious one and as a result we can observe the increasing long-term unemployment in many rural areas in Estonia. Compared with other transition economies, industrial employment has declined relatively little in Estonia and its share is still above 30%. The service sector has grown strongly \u2013 the share increased from 46% to 60% during these years (see Figure 2). Figure 2 Employed persons by sector of economy, 1989-2001 Regardless of the increase in the number of employed over the last two years (from 568.3 thousand in 2000 to 572.2 thousand in 2001), the number of economically active people i.e. people in work force, has decreased. It was brought about by the decrease of unemployment from the previously employed but also by the increase of inactive people (mainly women), who due to changes in the legislation registered themselves in employment offices. This is the reason for the higher unemployment rise among women, although the unemployment rate of men still remains higher, 13.0 and 12.3 respectively. Compared to the average unemployment rate in the EU (8.1%), the unemployment rate in Estonia is considerably higher. Unemployment in Estonia has been steadily increasing over the last years, and in spite of positive economic growth in 2000, unemployment rate reached the all time high of 13.7 percent (the respective figure in 2001 was 12.7%). Unemployment growth has been especially rapid among young people, and the number of people who have been out of work for more than one year has risen (see Annex 2). The unemployment rate among the young (15-24 years) is higher than the unemployment rate in other age groups. The cause for concern is the share of young people who neither study nor work. Unemployment among the young in Estonia has been continuously growing. In 2000, 6000 new young unemployed registered in employment offices and by the end of the year the total number of the young unemployed reached two thousand. In 2001, the unemployment rate of the young was recorded at 22.2%, the corresponding figure in the EU being 114 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1989 Primary sector 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Secondary sector Tertiary sector E m p l o y m e n t ( % ) ",
        "16.7%. In 2001, when the number of the unemployed reached 83.0 thousand, the share of the long- term unemployed formed 48.3% of the unemployed (40.1 thousand). Although the share of the long-term unemployed fell to a certain degree, in absolute figures it has continued to grow and compared to 1995, the growth has been 90%. When we add to the number of the unemployed the approximately 22.3 thousand discouraged people, who want to work but have given up any hope of finding a job, then the number of the people without work but willing to work amounts over 105 thousand. Frequently the main impediment in finding a job is an inadequate command of the Estonian language. In 2001, the unemployment among Estonians was 10.5%, among non-Estonians 16.9%. This is also reflected in regional unemployment statistics. The highest unemployment rate has always been in northeast Estonia. The unemployment rate varies from county to county, the difference sometimes being over two times. In spite of high unemployment rate, there is a severe shortage of skilled labour in Estonia, an indication of structural unemployment. Although the level of education obtained years ago may be high, it does not necessarily match the needs of the present-day labour market. Still, people with higher educational background are more flexible \u2013 they find it easier to adapt to the progress, upgrade their professional knowledge or learn new skills. Thus, the share of highly educated people among the unemployed is lower. According to the findings of a labour survey, the unemployment rate among people with basic education is only 16.8% whereas corresponding figure among people with higher education is 8.6%. The number of the unemployed registered in employment offices has increased steeply, exceeding 50 000 in November 2000, and peaking at 58 852 in March 2001. In July 2002, the corresponding figure was 45 233. Registered unemployment in reality, as compared to the unemployment statistics revealed by labour surveys, has always been twice as low, the reason being low motivation to register. Increase in the number of the registered unemployed at the end of 2000 can be accounted for by the Employment Service Act, enforced as of October 1, according to which the registered jobseekers are to be regarded as the unemployed and are entitled to a range of employment services. Hence, lot of the previously unregistered unemployed have taken advantage of the opportunity. In July 2002, the total number of people seeking assistance from state employment offices was 45 thousand, of them 5.3 thousand new-entrances. Unemployment benefit received 21.8 thousand unemployed persons and 227 unemployed (0.5% of the total number of the registered unemployed) received training. Employers receiving support (subsidy) from employment offices employed 7 unemployed and business start-up subsidies were granted to 13 unemployed. The mentioned numbers are inconsiderable, but the limited financial resources do not enable a more active labour market policy implementation. Only a few vacancies limit the number of jobs offered by the employment offices. In July 2002, only 1191 vacancies were registered in employment offices. The number of placements was 1790, i.e. many manage to find a job on their own. However, most of the unemployed are in need of retraining or additional training since the education and skills of the unemployed may not match the requirements. Summing up, the main problems on Estonian labour market are the following: 115 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "(cid:2) High unemployment rate \u2013 12.6% in 2001 in the age group 15-74; (cid:2) High unemployment rate among the young \u2013 22.2% in 2001 in the age group of 16-24; (cid:2) High share of the long-term unemployed among the unemployed \u2013 in 2001 48.3%; (cid:2) Mismatching of demand and supply (structural unemployment); (cid:2) Low administrative capacity of labour market institutions; (cid:2) Low financing of labour market policies (0.34% of GDP); (cid:2) Active measures targeting a relatively small number of the unemployed; (cid:2) Large regional differences. Compared to the EU member countries, unemployment rate in Estonia is nearly twice as high and one of the highest among candidate countries. While the EU spends 3-4% of GDP on implementation of their employment policies, in Estonia the corresponding figure is only 0.34%, being also the lowest among candidate countries. To decrease unemployment it is also crucial to encourage entrepreneurship and new job creation. Labour market policy in Estonia The governing labour market institution in Estonia is the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Labour Market Board (established in April 1991) works under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Its main tasks are: (cid:2) To administer labour mediation services bringing together employees and employers; (cid:2) To administer vocational planning and counselling services which help the labour force adjust to the structural changes taking place in the national economy; (cid:2) To co-ordinate advanced training and retraining programmes designed to enhance and develop the labour potential of the population; (cid:2) To organise unemployment registration, regulate the payment of benefits to the unemployed and supervise the entire process. To enhance the administrative capacity in the area of employment, the position of vice-chancellor was created at the Ministry of Social Affairs in 1999. In 2000, labour market department was established and the Labour Market Board was restructured. Preparation of development plans: (cid:2) In cooperation between the Ministry of Social Affairs of Estonia and the European Commission, an overview of the Estonian labour market policy: Employment Policy Review with Estonia, Joint Assessment Paper was prepared in 2000. The objective of the paper was to review the preparedness of the labour market system to implement the EU Employment Strategy. The current labour market situation is evaluated and the main problems and measures to solve them are highlighted. (cid:2) In October 2000, the Government endorsed the Employment Action Plan of the Republic of Estonia for 2000 4 th Quarter \u2013 2001 , which was prepared in cooperation between the ministries, social partners and other institutions. (cid:2) The Employment Action Plan 2002 of the Republic of Estonia reflects the official labour market policy and has been developed in compliance with the employment strategy of the EU and is based its on four main pillars. 116 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Estonian labour policy is very restrictive compared those in CEEC and in EU. Labour policies are rather insufficiently funded; the expenditures on labour market measure policies account for 0.34% of GDP in Estonia in 2001. This is a very small fraction compared to the respective average rate of 3.4% in the EU. Labour market policies have so far concentrated on rather passive activities in Estonia, mainly registering jobseekers and unemployed persons and paying benefits to them. Programmes designed to reduce unemployment, e.g. retraining, identifying the need for new specialities and occupations; job creation policies; etc. do not often meet society\u2019s needs yet. Table 3 Expenditures on labour market policies in Estonia, 1995-2001 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Total expenditures (mil.

At the same time, the overall coverage of the unemployed by the system of income maintenance is still low. The rate of unemployment benefit is currently so small in Estonia that a person who has lost their job has to apply for subsistence benefit as well. Thus the unemployment benefit fails to fulfil its function in smoothing consumption during the unemployment period of the household members. The new unemployment insurance system eliminates the need for people eligible to unemployment insurance benefit to apply additionally to subsistence benefit but it does not change the situation for people receiving state unemployment assistance. The replacement rate is low in Estonia: it is 27% for a couple without children, 33% for a single person and 39% for a couple with two children and 48% for a single parent with two children. On the other hand, it appears that in various cases it is more beneficial to live on benefits than start working for a minimum wage. The duration of the subsistence benefit is not limited. It is stated to decrease the motivation to search for work more than benefits with higher level but with certain termination date practiced by other countries. It is notwithstanding that at the same time when most of the EU countries tighten up on eligibility conditions for receipt of benefits, in Estonia the criteria have been relaxed. In order to decrease the negative effects of the benefit system on work incentives, it is proposed by different experts to make the eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits stricter and place stronger emphasis on the elements that would encourage people to search for work. (Kuddo et al, 2001). The share of active measures is relatively low, both either to consider the expenditures or participation rates. The participation of registered jobseekers in active labour market measures is 117 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "low too. In 2001, only 8.2% of registered jobseekers participated in active labour market measures. In accordance with the European Union employment guidelines, the goal is to achieve the involvement rate of 20% unemployed. An increased role for active labour market policies is therefore an important priority of the Estonian labour market policy. The Employment Action Plan 2002 includes a number of new initiatives with the aim to tackle the long-term unemployment (See Annex 2). Labour policies are connected with state regional policies such as promoting entrepreneurship in regions with high unemployment rates and in other ways stimulating job creation. This is even more important for Estonia, because during transition the regional differences (incl. unemployment) have increased drastically. The situation would be improved by differentiating labour market policies by regions, active labour market policies and several measures to develop the system of adult training and retraining programmes for people who may face layoff due to enterprise reorganization. The main aim is to reduce the mismatch of skills and youth unemployment, improve territorial mobility of labour resources, reduce the duration of unemployment, stop the increase of poverty among the unemployed. According to recent evaluations, one of the main problems is poor targeting of the programmes. Given the limited resources available, it will be important to ensure that these programmes remain targeted on the most disadvantaged jobseekers and regions and that their impact is closely monitored. One specific example is aid to starting business. Experience elsewhere suggests that this form of subsidy appears to be successful but only for a small group of unemployed individuals. Currently, there are different support structures implementing this kind of measures in Estonia. In addition to Labour Market Board, the business support structures under the governance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs offer start-up aid for beginning entrepreneurs. There is a need for closer inter-ministerial coordination in this field as well as for more efficient combining of the subsidy with relevant training and consultancy. (Paas et al, 2002) This situation will hinder seriously the Estonian integration to EU. Estonia needs more generous unemployment benefits system: both unemployment benefit and benefits duration should be increased. It could be concluded that because of the under-capitalisation of the labour market policy, the unemployment benefits are low and in this way do not decrease remarkably the labour market flexibility. On the other hand, through placing stronger emphasis on active labour market programmes, the positive impact of labour policy on labour flexibility could be increased. In this context, more attention should be paid to education and training, including development of lifelong learning, which is now an established priority throughout the EU. Social partners Trade unions There are two central trade union organisations (also internationally accepted) in Estonia: the Association of Estonian Trade Unions (EAKL \u2013 established in 1990) and the Estonian Professional Employees\u2019 Unions Association (TALO \u2013 established in 1992). The EAKL is the member of ICFTU and both have observer\u2019s status in ETUC. The EAKL, so called trade union of blue-collars, is the largest organisation: it embraces 24 branch unions with approximately 58 000 members. Five branch unions have joined EAKL during the last 118 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "five years, but at the same time overall membership (members of the unions) has decreased about a half. Since 1995, EAKL has created 5 regional branches and this is considered an important field of action in the future also. TALO is the organisation of trade unions of white-collar employers. TALO embraces 9 branch unions and one co-operative association with approximately 40 000 members.

The main obstacle to the development of trade unions and collective bargaining is the overall negative attitude towards trade unions. The unions are unpopular among both employers and employees. The unpopularity of trade unions among the employers is not difficult to understand. The worker-side low initiative has several reasons: (cid:2) One of the main reasons is the shortcoming of the legal background that supports poorly industrial democracy. Estonia has no legislation on co-determination, but in Estonia where the industrial relations are often employer-dominated, a strict legislation side prescription for participation organ is necessary to improve the situation of industrial democracy. (cid:2) The low level of activity of labour organisations is also the result of the relatively bad financial state of trade unions. (cid:2) The overall decrease of the active labour and increase of the unemployment have also caused the decrease in membership. There are some almost union-free fields (construction, banking, services, and small entrepreneurship). In conclusion, negative and positive sides of trade union activity are as follows: Negative (cid:2) Membership is very low. There is a declining trend. (cid:2) Qualifications of staff need to be improved. (cid:2) Financial problems. (cid:2) Negotiating power is not very high (low coverage rate, high unemployment) (cid:2) Regional representation is low. (cid:2) Society is not informed about trade union activity. Positive (cid:2) Future prospects of development are good (influence of Scandinavian countries). (cid:2) Influence of EU (ETUC, sister organisations); international contacts (mostly training). (cid:2) In some industries trade unions are very successful, positive experience should be shared. 119 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "(cid:2) Register of collective agreements was created. (cid:2) Trade unions become more visible in society. Employers\u2019 organisations On November 1991, associations of industrial branches formed the Estonian Confederation of Industry (ETKEL), which in the following year started to function as the representative of employers in social partnership. On May 1995, the organisation of employers ETKEL was reorganised into the Estonian Confederation of Industry and Employers (ETTK). As a result of the reorganisation and with the objective to protect the common interests of employers, the largest organisations and associations of infrastructure, such as the Association of Car Enterprises, Association of Ship Owners, Estonian Railways, Estonian Energy and Confederation of Agricultural Producers also joined the ETTK. On November 195, the associations of economic branches of the service sphere formed the second Estonian confederation of employers \u2013 the Estonian Confederation of Employers Organisation (ET\u00dcKL). Both the ETTK and the ET\u00dcKL acknowledged each other as independent associations of employers, engaged in constructive cooperation and participated together in negotiations with social partners (Estonian Employers\u2019 Confederation, 2002). Today, there is one federal organisation of employers \u2013 the Federation of Estonian Employers and Industry (ETTK), founded in 1997 by the merger of the Estonian Confederation of Employers\u2019 Organisations and the Confederation of Estonian Industry and Employers. Since March 1998 the ETTK is a member of the International Organisation of Employers (IOE). In July 1999, the ETTK was granted the status of an observing member of the Union of Industrial and Employers\u2019 Confederations of Europe (UNICE). On October 1999, the Council of the ETTK Virumaa Department was formed and its objective is to unify and organise the activities of the employers in the Virumaa region in order to facilitate the achievement of the ETTK objectives in East Estonia. The areas of activity of the Virumaa Department are counselling local governments and regional government bodies in enterprising, vocational training, environmental protection, power engineering and investments and mediation of the principles of participation democracy and social partnership (Estonian Employers\u2019 Confederation, 2002). The ETTK\u2019s membership embraces 32 branch associations of employers, 4 associated member associations and 22 commercial undertakings. This means that ETTK brings together approximately 6 000 enterprises with more than 200 000 employees. In the programme of the ETTK for 2001 \u2013 2003 are stated the following objectives: (cid:2) To conclude a wide social partnership agreement: specification of the interests of entrepreneurs in the long term development of society and its manifestation in a wide social partnership agreement, promotion of social dialogue with the representative organisations of the employees with the objective to establish bipartite relations instead of tripartite relations, an active introduction of the principles of social partnership to the society. (cid:2) All the legislation concerning employers and entrepreneurs will be elaborated in cooperation with economic branch unions: to extend the cooperation memorandum between the Government and entrepreneurial organisation to the level of ministries and branch unions so that the branch unions would be more efficiently drawn in to the elaboration of the legal acts managing the sphere of activity, to monitor the process of legislation and to arrange more effective exchange of this information, to forward standpoints and to stand for them in all the 120 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "legal issues concerning the members of the ETTK, to create a cooperation network with research and scientific institutions with the intention to protect the interests of the members more effectively in the process of legislation, to introduce continuously the legislation regulating the line of the ETTK with the training of the members, to develop the service of legal consultations. (cid:2) The members of the ETTK will provide work for at least 200 000 employees: to increase the influence of the ETTK in society by means of active participation in the social process and institutions concerning employers, to keep the existing members more happy by way of added exchange of information and protection of the principles of the members, to establish an essential criteria of representativeness for the new members and to develop a united attractive participation system for the new members, to elaborate a functional strategy of publicity for the new members, to organise training on the operation of branch unions and methods of their reinforcement. Tripartite consultative organisations Besides bilateral and tripartite negotiations the co-operation between social partners takes place also in tripartite councils and other consultative organisations. The main institutions concerning tripartite negotiations established by the government (the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible also for labour relations) in Estonia are the Estonian ILO Council and Social-Economic Council. Both of them consist of the representatives of the government, employers and employees. Social- Economic Council is the forum for social partners for consulting the government in the issues of social-economic processes and relations. Estonian ILO Council is a consultative organ established to help to improve the legislation and to develop tripartite negotiations. Other consultative organisations are the Medical Insurance Council, Labour Participation Councils, Vocational Councils, Labour Dispute Commissions, The Work Environment Council, etc. Including social partners in solving employment problems is vital. An agreement between the government, employers and trade unions was signed in August 1999 to create tripartite employment councils in counties at employment offices. Employment council has an advisory function the aim of which is to advise the local employment offices in planning and implementing employment measures. The objective is to increase efficiency of public employment offices in solving regional problems, utilising local initiative. So far, five employment councils have been formed. Social partners have also been involved in implementing the vocational reform. In December 2000, Ministers of Education, Economic Affairs and Social Affairs and representatives of employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations and Chamber of Commerce and Industry signed the co-operation agreement for the years 2001-2004. The objective is to guarantee qualified workforce and its importance to labour market demands. Collective bargaining Most European countries have a two-channel model of collective bargaining: the relationship between workers and employer are arranged through trade unions and workers committees. In Estonia the one-channel model is used. The absence of workers\u2019 committees is explained by the early stage of labour democracy and low initiative of workers but also by the expensiveness of the two-channel model. 121 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "Until now, the collective bargaining system in Estonia has developed quite poorly in all levels (i.e. enterprise, branch and state level). There are deficiencies in legal regulation, but the main problem is overall negative attitude towards the trade unions and collective bargaining. This is a throwback to the soviet system. Thus, the development of legal regulations plays a very important role in redefining the goals of trade unions and in establishing the framework for collective bargaining. Collective bargaining at enterprise, branch and regional level The number of collective agreements concluded in Estonia is quite small and employers have seldom been formed by means of actions (strikes, etc) to conclude collective agreements. This has happened partly because of the weak organisation of workers, partly due to the inability to understand the refusal to conclude a collective agreement as a labour dispute. (cid:2) The number of collective agreements on the enterprise level exceeds 570 in year 2000. It is a very small number if to take into account that there are roughly 70 000 all kinds of business entities. If the agreement does not state otherwise, the collective agreement extends to the members of the workers\u2019 organisation that concluded the agreement. In practice, the agreements are generally extended to all workers in the enterprise (not only to the members of the unions). The number of workers embraced with those agreements was approximately 99 000 (94% of union members). So the coverage rate in total was very low. (cid:2) Collective agreements at branch level are concluded in 13 branch unions in 2000 of EAKL (in 1999 were 11). The number of trade union members embraced by branch level collective agreements is 17 400 (decreased compared to 1999 \u2013 22 500) and employees is 36 000 (in 1999 \u2013 47 700). The branch level agreements are generally concluded with state owned or formerly state owned enterprises. The main topic of branch level agreements is the same as in enterprise level agreements \u2013 the work remuneration. The issues of safety and compensation in case of work accident are also emphasised in some branch level agreements. There are more collective agreements signed in transport sector, engineering sector, food industry, wood industry, textile and clothing industry, chemical industry, etc. In some branches (manufacturing, sailors\u2019 trade unions, fisheries trade unions) there is no branch organisation of employers\u2019 and no agreement can be concluded. The emphasis is in such branches wholly on enterprise level collective negotiations. Only three branch unions of TALO have concluded the collective agreement. (cid:2) EAKL has established 5 regional branches and besides that have got branch unions in their own regional departments. At the same time, there are no regional organisations of employers, except Ida-Viru region. Thus regional collective bargaining is possible only in one region and collective agreement is not the issue in regional level. Ida-Virumaa 4 regional branch of EAKL is the only regional level union that has reached the regional agreement with ETTK and local authorities. The agreement concerns employment and unemployment but is in the form of declaration and does not obligate anybody to anything and thus it is not a collective agreement. For example, the agreement states that the parties will take steps to improve the employment in Ida-Virumaa. However, it does not declare what kind of steps will be taken. Protection of workers\u2019 interests and rights at state level Tripartite consultations, information exchanges and negotiations are held in Estonia between the government of the state and the delegations of the employers and employees. There are six 122 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 4 Ida-Virumaa is the region with a large Russian population and trade unions are more developed there. ",
        "members in all three commissions. The employers are represented in the negotiations by the commission formed of the management of the ETTK. Employees\u2019 organisations EAKL and TALO have some tripartite and bilateral negotiations in the state level together and some separately. As EAKL is bigger organisation it has more importance in the state level collective bargaining. The results of activities of the EAKL are described firstly, and then the activities of TALO are discussed. The tripartite negotiations started in 1992, when the first tripartite agreement concerning social securities was concluded. The process of tripartite negotiations is managed by the Regulation of Tripartite Consultations ratified in 1996, which states that the schedule of the following consultations is settled on the previous consultation and the decisions are made on the principle of consensus. The tripartite agreements and consultations concern the rate of tax-free income, unemployment compensation, social security, vocational education, etc. Every year the national minimum wage is agreed upon during tripartite negotiations. The main contribution to the protection of employees\u2019 interests in state level by the trade union organisations is made through the consultation and co-operation in elaboration of legal acts concerning labour and social guarantees. A tripartite agreement is concluded that legal acts concerning employees are sent to trade union associations as well as employers\u2019 association for consultation. EAKL has made its contribution to the elaboration of national old-age pension insurance, health insurance, social tax and other acts. The tripartite agreements have gained more and more importance from year to year. Since 1992, there have concluded altogether 14 tripartite agreements in the state level (Sept. 2001). These concentrate mainly on people\u2019s income. The subjects that have been touched in tripartite negotiations in which EAKL was one of the parties were following: minimum wage, tax-free income, participation democracy, unemployment benefits and employment councils. The first tripartite agreement was concluded in 1992 and it concerned mainly minimum wage. Since then, minimum wage has been one of the most important topics of tripartite negotiations. The minimum wage has raised both in absolute and relative terms (see Table 5), but it is still low compared to the average wage. Table 5 Minimum and average wage per month, 1994-2001 Effective date of the Minimum wage Average nominal monthly Share (%) minimum wage in month (EEK) wage before taxes (EEK) 01.09.1994 450 1734 26.0 01.01.1996 680 2985 22.8 01.02.1997 845 3573 23.6 01.01.1998 1100 4125 26.7 01.01.1999 1250 4418 28.3 01.01.2000 1400 4907 28.5 01.01.2001 1600 5511 29.0 01.01.2002 1850 Source: Estonian Statistical Office. EAKL has the objective to raise unemployment benefits to at least 50% of minimum wage. Today these are only 25% (400 EEK per month) (see Table 6). The negotiations over unemployment benefits have not been as successful as have been the minimum wage negotiations. 123 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",

The negotiations of TALO have differences when compared with EAKL. Main topic is also the wage but differences lie in the level of aggregation. EAKL negotiates over the concrete numbers of minimal wage or minimum living standard i.e. over the benefits that are directly available to the receiver of the benefit. TALO negotiates over the wage fund. Thus, the precise wage numbers for workers are not the issues of collective bargaining on state level. Due to some negative experiences (e.g. the increase in wage fund resulted mainly in the increase of the wages of school directors and did not affect the wage of teachers) TALO is about to change this policy but no serious action has been taken yet. Bilateral negotiations In Estonia the bilateral negotiations are held between employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 central organisations as well as between the government and the unions and between the government and entrepreneurial organisations. On the bilateral consultations of the employers and employees shared principles and standpoints from the spheres of social partnership, industrial policy and social security have been confirmed. One of these agreements, signed on March 1999 by the ETTK and EAKL was a shared project \u2018The development of the Social Dialogue in Estonia\u2019. The project depicts the priorities of the social dialogue enlargement, preconditions for development and social dialogue for creating new jobs. Several questions concerning economic policy \u2013 priorities of Estonian economic growth, the industrial policy, tax policy affecting entrepreneurship, etc. \u2013 have been discussed between the government and entrepreneurs. Summing up, the social dialogue in undergoing a development in Estonia. Social partners\u2019 organisations are quite young institutions \u2013 during the last decade, employers\u2019 organisations and employees representative organisations have been established. Tripartism is satisfactorily developed at national level: tripartite negotiations and consultations are regularly taking place, the range of issues that are regularly discussed with employees, the Government and employers have identified. Social dialogue on the sectoral and company level is notably less developed. Collective agreements on wages and working conditions are being negotiated only in a limited number of economic sectors and companies. In the near future it is important to focus more on developing social dialogue at sectoral and company level. It is also necessary to expand the range of issues for negotiations beyond wages and working conditions. 124 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

        "To alleviate the situation and enhance the efficiency of labour market policies, the current Employment Action Plan has been devised. 6 Compared to the EU member countries, unemployment rate in Estonia is nearly twice as high and one of the highest among candidate countries. While the EU spends 3-4% of GDP on implementation of their employment policies, in Estonia the corresponding figure is only 0,24%. Due to limited financial resources, special attention will be paid to risk groups whose competitiveness in the labour market is the lowest. The target groups in the present action plan are the youth, the long-term unemployed and the disabled. In 2000, when the number of unemployed reached 96.5 thousand, the share of the long-term unemployed formed 44% of the unemployed i.e. 43 thousand. Although the share of the long-term unemployed fell to a certain degree, in absolute figures it has continued to grow and compared to 1995 the growth has been 90%. When we add to the number of the unemployed the approximately 24 thousand discouraged people who want to work but have given up any hope of finding a job, then the number of the people without work but willing to work amounts to over 120 thousand. In 2000, 6000 new young unemployed registered in employment offices and by the end of the year the total number of the young unemployed reached 25 thousand. In 4 th quarter of 2000 the unemployment rate of the young was recorded 26.4%, the corresponding figure in the EU being 16.7%. Decrease in the employment rate and the rapid growth of the unemployment accelerated after 1997, when Estonian economy experienced severe setbacks. Since then the increase in the employment rate has been the key issue in Estonia. In solving the problem, several areas, coordinated on the state level, are involved \u2013 such as education, economics and labour market policy. To attain the best results, al the changes in one area have to be coordinated with other parties and there has to be a common objective. The following guidelines are worked out: 1. Tackling youth unemployment and preventing long-term unemployment. One of the priorities of the employment policy is to increase the share of all active employment measures pursuant to the needs of the risk groups and labour market. As the situation on the labour market has become tenser, risk groups need a more tailored approach. For that purpose it is necessary to adjust available employment measures (training, vocational counselling, employment subsidies to employers and the unemployed, community placement) and increase their volume. To achieve this, additional funding is being applied for from the state budget for 2002. To assist long-term unemployed without special skills or work experience in finding employment, a new employment measure \u2013 work practice \u2013 will be developed and piloted. The aim of work practice is to provide the unemployed an opportunity to obtain work experience and work habit and acquire some simpler skills. 2. A more employment-friendly approach: benefits, taxes and training systems. The current tax system comprises a number of benefits and breaks enhancing the development of employment. 3. Developing a policy for active ageing. In September 1999, Government approved the following document \u201cThe basis for policy concerning the elderly in Estonia\u201d, which states the following principles: Annex 1 Employment Action Plan 5 126 5 The full text of the Employment Action Plan can be find in webpage of the Ministry of Social Affairs: www.sm.ee/gopro30/Web/ gpweb.nsf/pages/Social. 6 The Action Plan has been prepared in co-operation between Ministry of Social Affairs, the Labour Market Board, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Estonian Chamber of Disabled People, the Estonian Confederation of Trade Unions and the Estonian Confederation of Employers and Industry. ",
        "(cid:2) It is necessary to promote working at retirement age maintaining thereby the income tax free full pension and generate opportunities to work part-time. (cid:2) Special attention will be paid to the employment of people at pre-retirement age in order to make sure that thy will not remain in the background among other job-seekers. (cid:2) Conditions for smooth transition from work life to retirement will be created. (cid:2) Older workers (at pre-retirement age) should have the opportunity to get training and retraining, as well as receive benefits equally with other younger employees. 4. Developing skills for the new labour market in the context of lifelong learning. In the rapidly changing environment it is essential that qualification do not lag behind the changes. Therefore, it necessary to create favourable conditions for training and acquiring of new skills for those already in the labour market as well as for those still studying. A flexible educational and training system, able to respond to the changes, is an essential factor in the development of Estonian economy and increasing the employment rate. 5. Decreasing of structural unemployment and anticipating threats through active policies. Simultaneously with unemployment and exclusion from the labour market, in specific sectors and regions lack of labour can be observed. This situation endangers Estonia\u2019s economic growth. To decrease structural unemployment, active policies will be implemented to alleviate the arisen situation: (cid:2) To create additional jobs in country regions, it is planned to support and develop activities that help to generate and revive entrepreneurship in various fields. (cid:2) To support the diversification of entrepreneurship in rural regions and to increase competitiveness, improving social and psychological environment, development of infrastructure and the initiative of rural population in uplift social cultural and natural qualities of their environment. (cid:2) To increase the mobility of labour force and structural homogeneity via enlivening job mediation and exchange of information, self-service system will be established based on the elaborated Labour Market Board database of vacancies and training possibilities. It will enable job seekers to search information on employment services and situation in the labour market independently and to enter their own data with the aim of finding the job. 6. Diminishing of discrimination and increasing labour market openness. The labour market is not always accessible for the disabled in Estonia, thus increasing the risk of their social exclusion. The employment rate of the disabled has decreased dramatically in the last decade. To open up the labour market, make it more supportive and to improve the integration of the disabled to the work life, the following actions have been planned: (cid:2) Creation of subsidised jobs for the disabled youth in 5 regions. In the course of the project, through activation, the disabled young people will be better integrated to social and work life. (cid:2) The training of counsellors and the employment of the young disabled. To complexly solve employment problems of the young disabled, and additional collaboration network will be established comprising of various state institutions, private and non-profit organisations involved in employment issues. 127 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "(cid:2) The disabled will be provided with the essential skills on the field of ICT and during counselling sessions they will be encouraged to enter the labour market. After completing relevant training, it will be easier or them to adapt in the labour market and that will be able to perform distance work. 7. Making it easier to start up and run businesses and creation of new opportunities for increasing employment in the knowledge-based society and services sector.. The direct objective of the entrepreneurship policy is to foster business and creation of new jobs and to enhance the competitiveness of Estonian enterprises. The principle of balanced regional development constitutes the basis for achieving the objectives set. Entrepreneurship policy is horizontal in its essence, being tightly coupled with the development of several specialised fields led by independent policies or action plans. The support for entrepreneurship focuses on developing human resources in enterprises, improving funding, elaborating support structures for enterprises, improving access to business information and simplifying administrative procedures. 8. Regional and local action for employment. Regional development in Estonia is not uniform and the polarisation and contrasts between different regions are large. One of the most important objectives of employment policy is to create and elaborate preconditions for a balanced regional development. This can be attained via relevant regional development programs. 9. Modernising work organisation. Effective work organisation requires the involvement of social partners into decision making process and discussion on all levels that deal with relevant issues. 10. Supporting adaptability in enterprises as a component of life-long learning. Adult education strategy and implementation mechanisms will be elaborated based on life-long learning principles. The priority areas in adult education are: training for entrepreneurship, regulation vocational education system, social adaptation training for teachers, counsellors, instructors and school psychologists to enhance their ability to work with people in risk groups and with adaptation difficulties, training of trainers, civics and participatory democracy. 11. Gender mainstreaming approach. The basic component in the implementation of the equal principle is the existence of adequate information and its accessibility for certain political subjects as well as to wider public: (cid:2) The most essential manuals on the legal, analytical and application issues of gender mainstreaming will be translated into Estonian and published thereafter. The existence of the materials is absolutely necessary to raise the public awareness of equality issues. (cid:2) Equal opportunities website will be created. 12. Increasing the employment rate of women. The first step in increasing the employment rate among women is to obtain a clear overview of the working and business environment and its problems. It will help to improve the conditions more efficiently. The second step is to increase the availability of services necessary to start and operate a business. 13. Reconciling work and family life. A fulfilling family life is an inseparable component of gender equality at work. For various reasons women find it difficult to harmonise those two and therefore it is necessary to study the background of these issues in order to be able to offer more viable solutions. To reveal the causes for gender discrepancies in the economic status and 128 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "productivity at work, a collection of indicators will be developed based on two aspects: (1) different opportunities and positions for men and women in the labour market on organisation/business level, (2) parameters characterising the division of paid and unpaid work and the use of time resources between men and women. Financing for the Action Plan comes from the following sources: national budget, bilateral co- operation projects, funding by Phare, SAPARD and the Privatisation Reserve Fund (out-of-budget Government fund). 129 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "130 Decrease in the employment rate and the rapid growth of unemployment accelerated after 1997, when Estonian economy experienced severe setbacks. Unemployment in Estonia has been steadily increasing over the last years, and in spite of positive economic growth in 2000, unemployment reached the all time high of 13.7 percent. Risk groups in the Estonian labour market are defined as comprising the youth in the age group 16-24, the disabled, the long-term unemployed, mothers with small children, job-seekers who have lost their qualification, people at pre-pension age, people released from penal institutions, non-Estonian, etc. Unemployment growth has been especially rapid among young people, and the number of people who have been out of work for more than one year has risen. One of the profiles of the employment policy is to insure the share of all active employment measures pursuant to the needs of the risk groups and labour market. As the situation on the labour market has become tenser, risk groups need a more tailored approach. For that purpose it is necessary to adjust available employment measures (training, vocational counselling, employment subsidies to employers and the unemployed, community placement) and increase their volume. WHY develop? The unemployment rate among the young (15-24 years old) is traditionally higher than the unemployment rate as a whole in most of the countries. The reason being that most young people at this age are studying and thus their employment rate is low. The cause for concern is the share of young people who neither study nor work. The unemployment rate among the youth has been rising and the danger to remain unemployed after finishing school is increasing.

In 2000, the total number of the young unemployed reached 21 thousand (see Table). In 2001, the unemployment rate of the young was recorded 22.2%, the corresponding figure in the EU being 16.7%. In order to alleviate the seriousness of the problem, an increase in the share of active and preventive employment measures is planned, the aim of which is to assist the youth in integrating to the labour market and enhance their adaptive capacity. Annex 2 National development plan: Tackling youth unemployment through social dialogue ",
        "WHAT to develop? The following specific actions will be implemented: (cid:2) Planning education, especially vocational education, is of utmost importance. It would help to identify the needs of the students earlier to forestall potential risks and overcome already existing problems. In December 2000, Ministers of Education, Economic Affairs and Social Affairs and representatives of employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations and Chamber of Commerce and Industry signed the cooperation agreement for the years 2001-2004. The objective is to guarantee qualified workforce and its correspondence to labour market demands. (cid:2) In the framework of the Phare 2001 project \u2018Promoting the employment of the youth\u2019, the aim of which is to enhance the employment of the youth, active measures to better integrate the young in the labour market in Ida-Virumaa, Southeast Estonia and islands will be developed and implemented. During the implementation phase of the project, apprentice positions and subsidised jobs will be created at enterprises for students in two chosen fields, schemes to motivate employers will be elaborated and vocational counselling will be provided. In addition, in framework of the same project, employment offices\u2019 consultants, specialising in counselling the youth, will be trained. As a result of the project, guidelines for the combined implementation of different employment measures corresponding to the needs of the youth will be prepared. (cid:2) A study \u2018Adaptation of the youth in the labour market and factors influencing it\u2019 will be conducted. The objective of the study is to analyse the adaptation capability of the youth in the labour market, obtain an overview of the factors having impact on professional success or failure, identify the issues of the groups of young people with a higher risk to remain unemployed and find ways to reduce unemployment among the youth. An overview of their behaviour and the changes thereof, dependant on the educational level, personal characteristics of the youth and the conditions in the labour market during the last ten years, will be provided. Factors impacting the transition of the youth from schools to the labour market are being identified and evaluated. To perform the analysis, the data from Estonian labour surveys is used, questionnaire-based survey will be carried out in all the counties and focus group discussions are also planned. As a result of the survey, recommendations to implement labour market policy measures will be suggested to enhance the competitiveness of the youth labour market. (cid:2) To assist the long-term unemployed without special skills or work experience (among long-term unemployed the share of young people is very high) in finding employment, a new employment measure - work practice \u2013 will be developed and piloted. The aim of work practice is to provide the unemployed an opportunity to obtain work experience and work habit and acquire some simpler skills. After the preparation of the necessary guidelines, work practice will be tentatively used by different employment offices to find out whether the measure matches the needs of employees and the unemployed. As a result of the pilot implementation, proposals to amend the legislation and adding work practice to the list of employment services will be submitted. (cid:2) The labour market is not always accessible for the disabled in Estonia, thus increasing the risk of their social exclusion. The employment rate of the disabled has decreased dramatically in the last decade. To open up the labour market, make it more supportive and to improve the integration of the disabled to the work life, the following actions have been planned: (cid:2) Creation of subsidised jobs for the disabled youth in five regions (J\u00f5gevamaa, P\u00f5lvamaa, Sillam\u00e4e, Valgamaa, Hiiumaa). In the course of the project, through activation, the disabled 131 Social dialogue and EMU in Estonia ",
        "young people will be better integrated to social and work life. Contacts between different parties will be fostered and collaboration on different levels and between representatives from different sectors will be enhanced in order to solve the problems more efficiently. 90 subsidised jobs will be created. (cid:2) The training of counsellors and the employment of the young disabled. During the project vocational counsellors/implementer will be trained. They will assist in preparing the young disabled for entering the labour market. First, 20 subsidised jobs will be created. To complexly solve employment problems of the young disabled, an additional collaboration network will be established comprising of various state institutions, private and non-profit organisations involved in employment issues. WHEN to develop? Some projects (development of vocational education system, active employment measures, etc) are implemented already for several years, some pilot projects were starting in 2002. WHERE to develop? Some pilot projects in different counties of Estonia, where the unemployment rate is highest and the possibilities to find job is the hardest, for example in Ida-Virumaa, Southeast Estonia, and in islands. For example, under the guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and in co-operation between the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education, the Ida-Virumaa State Employment Program was prepared. The aim of the program is to decrease unemployment in Ida- Virumaa by concentrating the state resources on complex implementation of measures in business, social sphere and education. The program was prepared on the premise that the only way to decrease unemployment and increase employment was to promote and support private sector mainly by promoting human resources development. Other projects cover whole country. WHO are responsible? Action plans are prepared in cooperation with social partners and institutions who are responsible for the implementations of the programs are Ministry of Social Affairs, Labour Market Board, Employment offices, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Economic Affairs, local governments, social partners, non-profit organisations. WHAT resources are available? Financing for the different projects comes from the following sources: national budget, bilateral co- operation projects, funding by Phare, and the Privatisation Reserve Fund (out-of-budget Government fund). 132 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Kl\u00e1ra F\u00f3ti, Institute for World Economics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest In Hungary, there is a general acceptance towards accession to the European Union, opinion polls confirming that the majority of the population supports it. The polls also reveal, however, that people are hardly aware of its possible impacts on their life, work, and living conditions of their families. Therefore, first of all more information should be provided on these matters, and subsequently people should be encouraged to have more say in the matters of European integration. In this regard, the role of the social partners is of vital importance. In addition, experiences of the present EU-members have shown that the process towards the Single European Market and the European Monetary Union (EMU) had a major impact on the economies of the individual members and the role of social dialogue there. It is important, therefore, that already in the present stage of the accession process the social partners should be well prepared for those changes, which could be anticipated in the wake of joining the EMU. In this way, they would be able to contribute to develop such a strategy which could promote not only economic growth, but help increase employment and achieve better social conditions as well. This is the ultimate aim of the elaboration of a national development programme for the preparation process for EMU. This paper sets out to deal with this topic and consists of two main parts. The first part gives a general overview of the current political and economic situation of the country, as well as a brief account of the present state of industrial relations in Hungary. This part could serve as a background for outlining main ideas and concepts for a national development plan for the preparation of EMU, a topic which is dealt with in the second part of the paper. Political situation In Hungary general parliamentary elections are held every four years. The first free elections were held in spring 1990. Since then, altogether three successive governments have been in power, and all of them have served their terms of office, which can be regarded as a sign of political stability. The fourth elections took place in April this year. As a result, a new, left wing and liberal coalition government replaced the previous conservative one in May (see Table 1.)

        "quite like modern European social democrats\u2019. (The Economist, April 27, 2002.) Indeed, this big left-wing party identifies itself with social-democratic values. Its coalition partner is a small liberal party, a consequent supporter of the free market economy. The previous coalition was defeated in the last elections only with a very narrow majority. The results mean that the new government coalition has altogether 198 seats, whereas the former conservative coalition has 188 seats in the Parliament. On the one hand, this slim majority obviously raises the question of stability, and according to many analysts, discipline is needed in the Parliament much more than before. On the other hand, however, the only right wing party which, due to its anti-Semitism and xenophobic views, could be regarded as an extreme one, MI\u00c9P (Hungarian Truth and Life Party) fell out of the Parliament, and this fact might support stability. It is a subject of many debates why the conservative coalition lost the elections after a period of continuous economic growth. At first glance, it is all the more inexplicable because turnout at the elections reached a record 71% at the first round, and an even higher level of 73% at the second round. Analysts say that mainly protest-votes (against the conservative government and especially its ruling party, the FIDESZ) characterised the elections. The corruption affairs of some high- ranking Smallholder\u2019s Party members (a coalition partner) became known last year. This led to a virtual collapse of this party (having less than 1% at the current elections). Some reasons of mainly social character might have also contributed to the defeat: economic growth failed to translate into a general, appreciable improvement in the standard of living, although the personal income level has certainly risen to some extent. Income inequalities, however, widened further. According to some recent opinion polls, people tend to associate corruption also with FIDESZ (although some cases of corruption were revealed also during the period of 1994-1998, when the Social-Liberal coalition ruled Hungary). Moreover, the government failed to launch serious reforms on such important areas, like for example the health service. According to one of the analyses, the prime minister\u2019s \u2018increasingly authoritarian approach with regard to price controls and reforms, coupled with charges of cronyism, have held the economy back from the full growth spurts expected of it\u2019 (Guardian, April 10, 2002.) Presumably, it was the autocratic attitude which played some role also in marginalising the social partners (see details on this process in the section on industrial relations) Investors seemed to welcome the outcome of the elections (after the first round there was a sharp rise at the Budapest stock exchange). There are, however, some fears for an already over-stretched budget, which could be a real challenge for the new government, especially in view of the increased requirements for financing the so far neglected health and pension reforms. The over-stretched budget is deriving from the large commitments made by the previous government (partly in the last moments of its period in office). In addition, the perspective of over-expenditure is caused also by the fact that during the election campaign the biggest two parties (the Socialists and the Young Democrats, i.e. FIDESZ) were competing also in their promises. This, in the case of Socialists, included increases in social benefits and public sector wages, and at the same time they are also planning tax cuts. Many of the promises would be fulfilled during the first 100 days in office. The new government should face also political challenge since its opposition will be the biggest ever and certainly very active, self-confident and strong. It seems likely, however, that \u2018the new government will have better relations with European Union governments and foreign investors\u2019 (Financial Times, Robert Wright, April 24, 2002). After the elections G\u00fcnter Verheugen, member of the European Commission, who is responsible for enlargement, said that he is \u2018confident that Hungary will proceed with determination in its 134 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "preparation towards the accession to the EU.\u2019 Indeed, negotiations with the European Union are advancing well, so far 24 chapters have been temporarily closed. 1 Economic situation Economic performance in relation to the Maastricht criteria Since 1997, the Hungarian economy has been growing rapidly, at such a pace that could produce an annual growth rate twice as high as the EU average. (See Table 2). Table 2 Development of some major macroeconomic indicators in Hungary, 1992-2000 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Indices of GDP 1989=100 82.4 81.9 84.3 85.5 86.6 90.6 95.1 99.1 104.3 108.3 GDP growth (%)* -3.1 -0.6 2.9 1.5 1.3 4.6 4.9 4.2 5.2 3.8 Growth of industrial production -9.7 4.0 9.6 4.6 3.4 11.1 12.5 10.7 18.1 4.0 Consumer price growth index* 23.0 22.5 18.8 28.2 23.6 18.3 14.3 10.0 9.8 9.2 Unemployment rate ILO 9.8 11.9 10.7 10.2 9.9 8.7 7.8 7.0 6.4 5.7 Number of employed (%)* \u2013 \u20132.3 \u20132.0 \u20131.9 \u20130.8 \u20130.1 1.4 3.1 1.0 0.3 Labour productivity (%) a) * \u2013 \u20131.7 5.0 3.5 2.1 4.7 3.5 1.1 4.2 3.8 Growth of gross real earnings* 1.7 -0.5 5.1 \u20138.9 \u20132.6 3.4 3.5 5.5 3.4 8.1 Net increase in real wages* \u20131.4 \u20133.9 7.2 \u201312.2 \u20135.0 4.9 3.6 2.5 1.5 6.4 Note: a) GDP/employee * preceding year = 100% Source: Central Statistical Office, Budapest This faster growth could serve as a basis for achieving real economic convergence with the European Union. Although \u2018Hungary has the potential to maintain high and relatively stable growth over the medium term\u2019 (European Commission, April, 2002), it is an open question whether the real and the monetary convergence could be implemented simultaneously, especially with regard to the ambitious inflation target to be detailed below. Nevertheless, some developments have obviously contributed to the economic growth. For example, in Hungary a conscious policy of attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) started relatively early, already towards the late 80s, when some liberalising measures were introduced, which facilitated foreign capital inflow. Later privatisation contributed to increase foreign direct investment. As a result, during some years of the 1990s, Hungary had the highest stock per capita foreign direct investment among the Central and Eastern European candidate countries. Now the stock of FDI stands at around 25 billion Euro. There have been some controversial cases of companies with foreign capital. By nowadays, however, it has become clear the FDI contributed to developing a knowledge-based economy, by modernising certain industries. It was also evident that not only low labour cost, but also the relatively qualified and motivated labour force helped in attracting FDI. In addition, over the 1990s, large improvements in the telecommunication sector were developed, and this also facilitated the operation of foreign owned enterprises. Despite these obvious positive developments, there are some weaknesses in the Hungarian economy, which proved difficult to remedy. For example, although the country is small, there are 135 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary 1 Status: December 22, 2002. Source: Homepage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Hungary http://www.kum.hu. ",
        "large regional disparities, which are reflected also in the labour market (as shown by regional unemployment differences to be detailed below). It is clear that some of the weaknesses derive from the legacy of the planned economy. For example, inflation is still relatively high, price control has not been entirely abolished, in some areas it still exists, and as a result, the price structure is different from that in the EU-members, and the price level is uneven. It is inevitable that this will change in the near future, since Hungary is a small, open economy, and this will become less and less sustainable, especially as the accession process is going ahead. Due also to its smallness, the Hungarian economy is very vulnerable to cyclical changes in its export markets. So the country\u2019s export performance depends not only on the economic policy, but to a large extent also on external factors. Labour market performance As a result of recent economic growth, the labour market is showing signs of improvement: as can be seen from Table 2, unemployment has been falling since the mid-nineties, and employment started to increase in 1998 (although its growth rate has recently slowed down). Level of employment, however, is still well below that of the pre-transition period, and has not reached even the level of 1992, as Figure 1 shows. It is also clear from Figure 1 that in Hungary (like in most other Central and Eastern European CEE countries) unemployment rose in the early nineties to levels comparable to those in the developed countries classed as having high unemployment. (The national labour force shrank by over 1.5 million between 1988 and 1997.) Figure 1 Labour-market indicators: changes in employment level (left-hand scale, 1989 = 100) and unemployment rate (right-hand scale, %) Source: Central Statistical Office, Budapest, 2002. Despite the recent favourable developments, however, it is still questionable whether this trend could be maintained in the near future and continues even after joining the European Union. This depends on some unpredictable factors, including not only economic growth, but also conditions 136 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 60 70 80 90 100 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 1990 1991 Employment (1989=100) Rate of unemployment (%) 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 ",
        "of the accession, and its impact on employment. Although the aforementioned data suggest an unambiguous improvement on the labour market recently, if the labour force participation (activity rate 2 ) is considered, it becomes clear that, with a rate of 59.9% in 2000, the situation in Hungary is not so favourable as in most of the European Union member states. Even among the East- European countries, the rate is the lowest. Similarly, the employment rate is not very high, either. Although it has improved recently, it is still nearly 6% lower than the EU average. Large economic disparities existed between regions and between the various types of settlements in Hungary even before the transition. It is not surprising, therefore, that once market forces began to apply, many of the problems persisted and became even more visible. They are reflected in labour-market diversification, shown by large differences in unemployment rates and in economic activity. Unemployment rates by counties (traditional regional administrative units) show that counties with high unemployment can have rates three or even four times higher than those with low unemployment. For example, in 1998 the rate in Budapest stood at 4.5%, whereas in some counties in Northern Hungary the respective figure reached 19.2% (source: National Labour Office, Budapest). It is remarkable that despite improving labour market performance in the late 90s, differences in regional unemployment rates have not changed much. This supports the assertion that labour-market disparities are deeply rooted. The problem is that especially in small villages and fairly remote areas, the chances of finding a job are very poor. The integration of these communities into the economy is impeded by the poor road system. This is a grave problem even in more developed counties. An underdeveloped transport infrastructure is a major impediment to labour mobility. Furthermore, the rapid, sizeable economic decline in some backward areas since the transition has caused housing prices to slump, leaving people unable to sell their homes and move elsewhere. This is characteristic especially of regions in northern Hungary that were formerly centres of heavy industry (like for example in Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n county). According to the most recent figures, long-term unemployment has decreased. This, however, could be explained by some measures of the government two years ago, rather than a considerable improvement on the labour market. (Data of the Labour Force Survey confirm poor chances of finding jobs: the number of the so called \u2018discouraged workers\u2019, i.e. those who gave up job search due to hopeless prospects, amounts to around 100 thousand persons every year.) The aim of the measures was to redirect financial resources, spent previously for unemployment compensation, to more active labour market policy. They included a reduction in the period of entitlement to unemployment benefit from one year to nine months. As regards the long-term unemployed, the means-tested \u2018income supplement\u2019, provided previously for them, was abolished, and instead a \u2018work test\u2019 was introduced. This means that if they participated in a public utility or public work scheme for at least one month, they became eligible for permanent social assistance. Experiences showed, however, that it proved difficult to organise these schemes due to lack of both financial and organisational capacity of many of the local municipalities. Even if the main objective of some of the aforementioned measures was to encourage people for job-search and thus to integrate unemployed persons into the labour market 3 , it is clear that living conditions of many of the 137 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary 2 Share of the economically active population (employed persons and unemployed) in the working age population, which, according to the Hungarian statistical standards, is the population between 15-74 years (though for international comparison the standard 15-64 years is more and more often applied as a base). 3 These measures seem to reflect the employment guidelines of the European Union, obviously already in the spirit of the preparations for the accession. As is well known, one of the main concepts behind these guidelines is to promote \u2018employability\u2019. ",
        "unemployed deteriorated. Recognising harmful side-effects of these measures, the new government is considering the ways and means of involving long-term unemployed persons in the labour market most efficiently. As regards wage developments, recently the minimum wage has been increased to a large extent. For the first time, in January 2001, the government raised it by almost 57% and for the second time next year, in January 2002, by a further 25%. As a result, its share in the gross average wage became much higher: from the level of 28.8% in 1998 to 42.3% in 2001. Although the government tried to explain the increase with the requirements of the catching up process to the current EU- members, preliminary estimates on its main effects made it clear that the central budget would be the main beneficiary of this measure. Of course, there have been some fears of its employment effects, raised primarily by the trade unions. As regards this, at the moment it is difficult to draw an unambiguous conclusion especially in the macro-data since only a short time has passed since its introduction. An empirical survey 4 showed, however, that certain branches (for example, trade) and their workers were adversely affected. (There were some cases of layoffs, and also more work for less pay as a result of adjustment of the employers to the increased labour costs.) Current monetary conditions in relation to the Maastricht criteria As is well known, some time after accession to the European Union, the candidate countries have to join also the European Monetary Union (EMU). Before becoming a full member of the EMU, however, they are obliged to meet all the Maastricht criteria, which are as follows. (cid:2) Exchange rate: minimum two years before the accession to the EMU, the currency should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), where the trading band is +/-15%; (cid:2) Inflation: it should exceed the average inflation rate of the three best performing EU-member countries by a maximum of 1.5%; (cid:2) 10-year (long-term) interest rate: it could exceed by a maximum of 2% the average long-term interest rate of those three EU-member countries, where these interest rates are the lowest; (cid:2) Budget deficit: it is not supposed to exceed 3% of the GDP (cid:2) State debt: it is not supposed to exceed 60% of the GDP. Of these criteria, it is the inflation target which seems the most challenging task for Hungary to fulfil. The previous government, which was also determined to the EU-accession, set an ambitious objective according to which inflation should be decreased continuously and to a considerable extent because over the last couple of years it remained relatively high, compared also to other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The annual average inflation of 9.2% in 2001 was only slightly lower than a year earlier (see Table 2), but the most recent trend seems more favourable. In mid 2001 the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) changed the exchange rate system by making it more flexible, and this obviously contributed to disinflation. The currency\u2019s trading band was widened to +/-15%, and the previous devaluating crawling peg exchange rate system was entirely abolished. The reason for widening the band was that this would allow an appreciation of the currency, and thus, would help to reduce inflation. This has actually happened because, as a 138 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 4 See: GKI, Adler. ",
        "result, between May and December last year, the Hungarian currency (Hungarian Forint) appreciated in real terms by about 12%, and the year-end inflation was reduced to 6.8%. It is doubtful, however, whether the trend of disinflation could be sustainable in this way, and if yes, to what an extent. It does not seem likely that such a high real appreciation level could be repeated since this was only a one-time reaction to modifying the exchange rate system, and even if nominal appreciation continues, its extent is supposed to be lower. This might be one of the reasons why Hungarian experts (research institutes \u2013 see the forecasts in the Annex) expect higher inflation than the one targeted by the National Bank. According to the forecasts, this year the inflation could be between 5.2-5.7%, whereas the central bank\u2019s inflation target is only 5% (its end-of-year inflation target is even lower, 4.5%) In addition, there are some risks threatening also on medium term such a dynamic inflation decline. They include \u2018a rapidly growing domestic demand, a continuation of fiscal relaxation, and a possible domestic price-push following the planned step-by-step liberalisation of certain regulated prices\u2019. Especially as regards the very low target (2%) by as early as 2004-2005, one could agree with the conclusion by the European Commission, which says that they \u2018would only be achieved at some cost for the real economy\u2019. At the same time, however, the potential inflationary pressure from the wage side does not seem high at the moment. According to the Commission, \u2018present wage developments should not add considerably to inflation, since they not least represent a catching-up phenomenon after several years of strong productivity gains which had regularly remained significantly above wage settings.\u2019 As regards future wage developments, however, the Commission says that they \u2018will need to be brought back into line with productivity growth, in order not to start exerting inflationary pressures\u2019. At first glance, there are fewer problems with fiscal policy. The figures suggest that the deficit hardly exceeds the targeted 3%, and the public debt stands at around 60%. There are some items, however, which are not included in the budget, although, according to the Maastricht Treaty, they are supposed to be there. If they are also considered, the deficit could be higher than 5%. In addition, as mentioned above, the budget is already over-stretched. Although this could be a short- term phenomenon, it is an open question how the deficit could be kept within reasonable limits. Moreover, as a result of the aforementioned dynamic inflation decline, budget revenues could decrease because the seigniorage revenues could be lower. Over the past few years extra revenues were generated also because the inflation has always been higher than planned. Moreover, major reforms in such areas (like for example health and pension systems), are still to be implemented, requiring further budgetary resources. Therefore, a gradual, annual ease in the deficit could only be expected after these reforms, but even at that time this seems realistic if the disinflation trend continues. Favourable budgetary trends require, however, dynamic GDP-growth. The aforementioned ambitious inflation target could adversely affect the latter (due to appreciation requirements, which are not favourable for the export performance, serving as a base for economic growth in such a small, open country, like Hungary is). Therefore, sustainable, meaningful growth would require slower progress in financial stabilisation (Dezs\u00e9ri, R\u00e1cz, Ferkelt, 2002.). Nevertheless, if Hungary\u2019s current fiscal and monetary position is compared to that of the less developed Mediterranean EU-member countries three years before their joining the EMU, it is clear that in most of the criteria, the country is actually closer to fulfilment than, for example, Greece was at that time, and in the case of the two fiscal criteria, the Hungarian performance is better than that of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the mid-90s (see Annex). 139 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary ",
        "Industrial relations In Hungary, the institutional framework for a tripartite social dialogue was set up so early, in the late eighties, that in Central and Eastern Europe, this was the first to be established (Lad\u00f3, T\u00f3th, 2000.). First, in December 1988 the National Interest Reconciliation Council (NIRC) was founded, later in 1990 it was renamed and restructured to Interest Reconciliation Council (IRC). This consisted of the employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 representatives as well as those of the government. During the first turbulent years of transition, the Council, as a key institution for tripartism at national level, played an important role not only in preventing and solving social conflicts, but contributing to the preparation of the new labour legislation and rules as well 5 . The IRC helped maintain social peace in 1995-96, when real wages dropped by 18%. At the same time, however, it had serious difficulties to face. They came into surface and became conspicuous especially in 1995, after the failure to conclude a Social and Economic Agreement 6 . According to some experts, its transformation, which was first raised at that time, was necessary (albeit not in the way it was actually carried out in 1999, \u2018by splitting\u2019 the IRC; see details below and the list of these institutions in Table 4 7 ). \u2018None of the participants were satisfied with the activity of the IRC at that time\u2026 There was, however, a general agreement in one area: IRC must be renewed and reformed on the basis of the lessons learnt from repeated failures. This fact demonstrates that all interested parties, despite their disappointments, still believed in tripartite co- operation and wanted to maintain its basic forum\u2019 (Lad\u00f3, T\u00f3th, 2000. 8 ). Table 3 shows the \u2018interested parties\u2019, i.e. the main social partners and their current membership. As can be seen, the number of those employers, which are represented in the national institutions of social dialogue is quite high and there are large differences between them both in terms of their tradition and also in their coverage and influence. Despite trust of the participating parties in tripartite co-operation, the IRC had to face difficulties (as mentioned above), of which representation and legitimacy problems as well as weakness of the social partners could be regarded as the most important ones 9 . Growing labour market tensions, which characterised especially the first phase of the economic transition (the early 90s), have contributed for example to weakening role of the trade unions. This was reinforced by other, also in the region very common and well known factors. They include the legacy of the monolithic trade union system of the past, divergence between the emerging trade unions, difficulties to find their identity and place in the new political setting, etc. Both the biggest trade union (MSZOSZ) and the newly emerging ones had problems to reinforce their position in the workplace. 10 Major structural 140 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 5 See a more detailed account on IRC\u2019s functions, structure and activities in: H\u00e9thy, 2001. (pp. 21-26.) 6 There were many other problems at that time, connected partly with deteriorating state of the economy, as a result of which in March 1995 austerity measures (called \u2018Bokros package\u2019) was introduced. This \u2018seriously undermined the tripartite co-operation\u2019. Talks on concluding a Price and Wage Agreement, initiated by the IRC in the second half of the year, also failed. (Lad\u00f3, T\u00f3th, 2000.) 7 See: Interview with Lajos H\u00e9thy (M.Rimay, 2000). Among other things, he obviously referred here to establishing two councils, the National Labour Council and the Economic Council (see table 4). 8 In their paper, Lad\u00f3 and T\u00f3th presented the development of tripartism over a decade, distinguishing five phases in its history (see details: Lad\u00f3 and T\u00f3th, 2000). 9 See: interview with Lajos H\u00e9thy, made by M. Rimay Andrea. 10 Some changes, adopted in the 1992 Labour Code may have also contributed to their weakening role in the workplace. The Code took away \u2018the exclusive union rights to represent employees in management decision-making\u2019, which had been given by the 1968 Labour Code, when allowed collective agreements at the workplace. The 1992 Code set up a new institution of employee representation, called works council, for enterprises with 50 or more workers As a result, in Hungary a dual system has developed in this respect, since both the trade unions and the works council can be present at the workplace (see: \u00c1d\u00e1m, 2000). ",
        "changes in the economy, as a result of transition to a market economy, led obviously to this situation. It is understandable that in the rapidly expanding private sector, where many small enterprises operate, trade unions\u2019 presence is sporadic since per definition, firms below 50 employees have neither trade unions, nor works councils. As a result of the complexity of the issues covered by the IRC, it was increasingly realised that for a more effective functioning, the national industrial relations system would have to be separated into two institutions: those which are to deal with economic and social issues, and those which would be concerned only with labour topics (as mentioned above, this was recognised already in the mid-nineties). In 1999, under the pressure of the conservative government, which came to power in 1998, a separate Economic Council and a National Labour Council were set up as successors of the ICR.

Apart from its authoritarian approach (mentioned above, in the section on political situation), that government held quite a hostile attitude towards trade unions, regarding them as some kind of \u2018socialist remnants\u2019. In addition, they \u2018had the initial objective of rejecting any corporatist endeavours\u2019 11 . Weak legitimacy of the trade unions, however, certainly explains also why this 141 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary 11 Lad\u00f3 and T\u00f3th (2000.) quote a public document, written by two high ranking government officials, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Herczog and Csaba \u00c3 ry in 1999. ",
        "transformation could take place without the approval of the social partners. This also contributed to the fact that with this step, the government was able to marginalise the tripartite institutions. 12 . Focusing exclusively on labour issues, the National Labour Council, which could be regarded as the direct successor of IRC, had fewer competencies than its predecessor had. Whereas the aim of the Economic Council was to provide such a consultative forum on economic policy issues, where not only employees and employers were represented, but also chambers (Hungarian and foreign ones), multinational companies, the banking sector, etc 13 . As a result, \u2018the powers and responsibilities assigned earlier to social partners are now shared with other actors\u2019, therefore \u2018the distinguished role that social partners possessed earlier in economic and social policy making has been curtailed\u2019 (Lad\u00f3, T\u00f3th, 2000.) For this reason, the evaluation of the Civil Country Report is understandable: \u2018In the wake of the changes since 1998 social dialogue has become empty and reached the lowest point\u2026\u2019. The new forums \u2018are rather designed for hearing information and opinions, not for reaching consensus or concluding agreements. The new forums of social dialogue have been degraded to simple consultations\u2019 14 Table 4 Major organisations of the national industrial relations system, 1990-2002 Organisation(s) Date Institutional/legal basis Composition Sub-committees Interest Reconciliation Council 1990-1998 Government decree, backed Employers: 9 Yes by a Tripartite agreement** Trade Unions: 6 National Labour Council Since April 1999 Government Decree Employers: 9 Yes Trade Unions: 6 Economic Council Since April 1999 Government Decree Multipartite Yes (from end 2001) Council for ILO Affairs Since May 1999 Government Decree Employers: 9 No Trade Unions: 6 Council for European Integration Since June 1999 Government Decree Multipartite No Orsz\u00e1gos \u00c9rdekegyeztet\u00e9si Tan\u00e1cs Since July 2002 Tripartite agreement Employers: 9 Yes (its English name is to be decided) Trade Unions:6 ** Government Decree 3240/1990 in an internal, albeit not confidential governmental document. It includes obligations related only to the Government Within this context, it is understandable, that the trade unions became quite sceptical about their potential role, voice in, and influence on the accession process. Despite this scepticism, some institutions 15 , dealing with European integration, have been built up, though they were established at an initiative at European level. 142 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 12 This government abolished also by decree the self-governing body of the social security fund, led by the biggest trade union confederation, the MSZOSZ (Kocsis, 2000.) 13 On the competencies of the National Labour Council, and a list of the participants in the Economic Council, see: Lad\u00f3, T\u00f3th, 2000. 14 Civil Country Report, 2000. 15 Such organisation is, for example, the National European Integration Commission of Hungarian Trade Unions (MSZEIB), which was founded in 1996. It is a member of a committee, co-ordinating trade unions of the candidate countries. Two other institutions are concerned with the topics of the negotiations on the accession: the Hungarian-EU joint parity commission of the EU\u2019s \u2019 Economic and Social Commission (ESC) and the European Integration Council, listed in table 4. (See a list of these organisations in: Borb\u00e9ly, 2000. and a detailed analysis and evaluation on the activities of some of them in: Boda, Neumann, 2000.) ",
        "As mentioned, foreign capital plays a major role in the Hungarian economy (40% of the assets of the companies in Hungary is in the hands of foreign investors, and firms with foreign capital have a share of 76% from the total import and 80% of total export). Therefore, it is worth mentioning their participation in the employers\u2019 organisations. Foreign investors are also represented in several employers\u2019 organisations, and they set up their own umbrella organisation, called Investors\u2019 Council. Its members are as follows: Permanent Commission of European Chambers, American Chamber of Commerce, Joint Venture Association, Hungarian Association of International Companies and the biggest foreign investor companies in Hungary. Previously, many of these firms had not been represented in the Interest Reconciliation Council (IRC), but they participate in the work of the later established Economic Council. In light of the aforementioned tendency of weakening social dialogue over the past two-three years, the social partners demand, among other things, that the \u2018government has to resume meaningful social dialogue, genuine conciliation of interests, negotiations resulting in agreements\u2026\u2019. They want also the expansion of the coverage of collective agreements and improving its content. (Civil Country Report, 2000.) The employers also support these principles. (It has to be noted that at the sectoral level, employers are not authorised to conclude binding collective agreements.) It has to be acknowledged that one of the major problems is that a significant part of workers and employers are not covered by any kind of agreements, so a large share of economic actors is not affected by industrial relations. Legitimacy problems are therefore understandable. They are also reflected in the current state of the sectoral social dialogue, which \u2018in the European sense, is rather poorly developed in Hungary, if it exists at all\u2019. (Lad\u00f3, 2001.) There are several reasons why both the bipartite sectoral level co-operation, and co-operation between sectoral social partners and the relevant state administration could be regarded as the \u2018weakest link\u2019 in the Hungarian industrial relations system. As regards the former, the bipartite sectoral level, it is central tripartism which is comprehensive and effective, and at the same time, the traditionally decentralised collective bargaining structure makes the enterprise level dominant 16 : they account for a 39.3% coverage ration in the competitive sector (see Table 5). As a result, sectoral level collective bargaining is \u2018squeezed between central tripartism and traditional enterprise bargaining\u2019 (Lad\u00f3, 2001). As regards co-operation between sectoral social partners and the relevant state administration, the sectoral tripartite councils (the institutional framework provided for it by a Government decree) have disappeared, and now only formal, but not meaningful consultations are going on. In addition, there are some other reasons for the weakness, like for example asymmetry of social partners at sectoral level (because some sectoral trade unions survived the political and economic changes, whereas their counterparts, the employers are either missing, or having a too complex structure). Undoubtedly, objective circumstances, like major changes in the economy over the past decade, an instability in the wake of the transformation, diversity of enterprises within a given sector all play an important role in the weakness of sectoral social dialogue 17 . Nevertheless, there have been some initiatives in recent years on the area of sectoral social dialogue, which could be regarded as 143 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary 16 Duality of worker\u2019 representation through presence of works council and trade unions (as mentioned above), accentuates dominance of the enterprise level (Lad\u00f3, 2001). 17 See a more comprehensive list of the reasons in: Lad\u00f3, 2001. ",
        "promising. At enterprise level, social dialogue could be characterised by two extremes: big companies have trade unions, works councils, and collective agreements are concluded, whereas in the small and medium-sized enterprises, of which number is very high 18 , neither could be found 19 .

In view of all the aforementioned developments within the national industrial relations system, critique of the 2001 Regular Report of the European Commission seems reasonable: \u2018In the area of social dialogue, the relationship between the government and the social partners continued to be marked by a lack of confidence and trust and by difficulties in operating effective tripartite social dialogue within the various newly established structures\u2019. Recently, the new (socialist-liberal) government expressed its intention to pursue meaningful dialogue with the social partners, with a view to concluding agreements. As a result of their previous consultations, the government and the social partners confirmed that they found it necessary to restructure the national industrial relations system. Therefore, a new institution is to be set up, which has similar functions to the former Interest Reconciliation Council. It covers not only labour and employment issues, but economic questions, including the tax system, areas concerning the central budget, draft legislation, etc. Similarly to the former ICR and the NLC, the new institution will have subcommittees, specialised on the various important topics. At the same time, the National Labour Council is abolished, whereas each of the other bodies (existing since 1999, see Table 4) will continue its work as a special forum, with the exception of the Economic Council. This is to be transformed into the Economic and Social Council, a consultative forum for comprehensive national strategic objectives and programmes. It is clear that the government and 144 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 18 For example, in 2001, the number of enterprises employing between 5 and 9 employees amounted to 32 857, those applying between 10 and 19 employees 18 210, whereas the number of those, which employed above 100, amount altogether to just above 4 000. (Source: Central Statistical Office, Economic and social database, ed. E.Hanti, 2001). 19 The 2001 Regular Report of the European Commission concluded that \u2018At enterprise level, collective agreements exist mainly in large companies.\u2019 ",
        "the social partners want to place a special emphasis on the sectoral social dialogue because a new special forum is to be established, called \u2018\u00c1gazati Tan\u00e1cs\u2019. Its task is to manage the PHARE programme on \u2018Strengthening autonomous social dialogue\u2019, and to help establish the Sectoral Dialogue Committees. According to the current plans, already in 2003 these Committees would provide an institutional framework to conclude the sectoral agreements. 145 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary ",

        "148 Before presenting our main objectives, it is important to look at the forecast of some major macroeconomic indicators, prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Table 6 shows a relatively moderate growth for the last year, reflecting a recent slowdown in the process of dynamic growth over the last few years. The Finance Ministry, however, predicts a more dynamic economic growth for the next couple of years. We have to emphasise, however, that further economic growth highly depends not only on future developments in the world economy, but also on the internal situation. Indeed, it would be quite exceptional to maintain this stable and dynamic growth and at the same time, to lower inflation at such a quick pace. It is also an open question how the budget deficit could be reduced by more 1.25% already in 2003, when (as mentioned above) reforms of such important areas, like health service, should be launched without delay, initially requiring substantial state resources. It is also doubtful whether real wages could develop according to the plans of the Finance Ministry. First, real wages could increase even more this year (not only due to a large minimum wage growth at the beginning of the year and to its consequences on relative wages, but also to large wage increase in the public sector, as a result of fulfilment of promises during the election campaign). Second, it is problematic that after such a considerable increase, how real wages could be restrained to such an extent within a few years. Although the government is planning to agree on a moderate nominal wage increase with the social partners in 2003, it is not clear whether this could be achieved if the inflation cannot be reduced to such an extent as planned.

As can be seen, there is much uncertainty both about the external circumstances (conditions in the world economy, especially in the European Union), and their impacts on the Hungarian economy. Therefore, what follows, are not concrete proposals for such a Pact, but a non-exhaustive list of the main objectives, for which, in our view, a consensus of all the social partners could be achieved. We collected answers to 6 questions (all beginning with \u2018W\u2019). The questions are as follows: 1. What to develop? 2. Why develop? 3. Who are responsible for the implementation? Annex 1 Outline of a National Development Plan from the social partners in preparation for the EMU ",
        "4. When will this process take place? 5. Where to develop? 6. Which means/funds are available for this purpose? What to develop? In Hungary, it has not been decided as yet whether a Social and Economic Pact, or a Price and Wage Agreement should be elaborated as part for preparations for the Economic and Monetary Union. According to government representatives, it is still an open question whether the social partners are able and ready to guarantee that such a pact, or agreement would be respected, and if yes, what an extent of the economy the pact/agreement could cover. The government is ready to involve other groups to such an agreement (other representatives of the civil society). The social partners agree that the main general objective is to achieve real economic and social convergence . For this, sustainable economic growth is needed. This could only be maintained with financial balance , which means that budget deficit, inflation, and state debt should be kept at such a level, which makes it possible to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in due course. It seems, however, that so far the government has focused rather on monetary and fiscal conditions of the convergence, and was concerned less with social conditions. Therefore, we emphasise that social convergence is equally important, and this process should accompany that of the economic convergence. It is true, that if dynamic economic growth could be achieved, employment could also increase (according to government plans, employment could grow by 1.5-2% annually, within the next four years). We think, however, that it is important to pay more attention to the active labour market policy measures to integrate vulnerable groups into the labour market. When? In line with the current timetable for accession, the National Development Plan (NDP) should be implemented in three phases: 1. Until the date of accession: Pre-accession period. (Expected date of accession 1 st of January 2004) 2. 2004 - 2006: Preparations for the European Monetary Union (in this period the preparations could be finished) 3. 2006-2007: Full-fledged participation in the EMU. Why? We are convinced it is important to implement the above main objectives in order to maintain and even develop the country\u2019s competitiveness , which is crucial from the point of view both Hungary\u2019s export performance and its stable and high economic growth. If this is achieved, sustainable development and social peace could be maintained, although we think that stable economic growth is a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite for human development. Who? The main actors for promoting the implementation of the National Development Plan should be the social partners (the government, employers and trade unions), and we think that the civil society (citizens themselves and the NGOs) should take also an active part in it. 149 Social dialogue and EMU in Hungary ",
        "Where? We think that the NDP should be implemented at central, regional and local level, and in this respect we consider important that between them (in the division of labour) a proper balance should be established. Which? For the NDP in the first phase (i.e. up to 2004), we should rely on national resources and pre- accession funds, and later (from 2004 on) on national resources and EU-funds. In order to achieve the main goals of the NDP, the following priorities/tasks should be given special attention: (cid:2) Elaborating various employment and training programmes; (cid:2) Developing an inclusive society, by applying equal opportunity measures; (cid:2) Continuing the wage catching up process; (cid:2) Sharing responsibilities between the various actors of the Plan; (cid:2) Gaining public support (for this dialogue and training programmes are needed to raise awareness); (cid:2) Introducing capacity building measures, especially in terms of education and training; (cid:2) Monitoring progress in implementation; (cid:2) Gaining feedback and corrections. The social partners (trade unions and employers) highly appreciate the readiness of the new government to pursue meaningful dialogue, and they want to utilise this positive and open attitude towards them, in order to achieve common objectives, among which facilitating the accession process to the European Monetary Union is of special importance. 150 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

        "Gita Feldhune Human Rights Institute, University of Latvia The aim of this national report is to give an overview of the current situation of social dialogue in Latvia, as well as its possible development from the EMU perspective. The report is structured as follows: first, the economic situation of Latvia is analysed briefly, paying special attention to the EMU criteria; next, the political situation is discussed and, finally, the last section examines industrial relations and social dialogue in Latvia. Economic situation This discussion draws largely on the report by the Ministry of Economics (2002) entitled \u2018Economic Development of Latvia\u2019. Reforms accomplished in Latvia have left a positive effect on economic development. In recent years, Latvia has become one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. Gross domestic product (GDP) between 1996 and 2001 has increased by 39.3%, or by 5.7% on average per year. The dynamics of GDP is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1 Growth of GDP, 1996-2005 (%) Source : Draft Development Plan (2002) The key indicators of economic development in Latvia are presented in Table 1 (overleaf). In nine months of 2002, outputs of manufacturing increased by 6.3%. Growth of manufacturing strongly depends on the external demand. In the first months of 2002, Latvian exports to western Europe declined because of the sluggish economic development in the EU. However, in the following months exports to the EU went up again (in the third quarter by 20%). This demonstrates that some individual sectors, such as wood processing, textile industry, metal production and metal processing, are able to compete in Western markets even in rather unfavourable conjuncture circumstances.

However, on the whole, the situation in agriculture is gradually becoming more stable. Low labour productivity and external competition are the main obstacles for the development of this sector. Trade, commercial services and financial mediation is rapidly expanding for several years already. The development of these services sectors is encouraged by the growth of income of people and enterprises, greater availability of lending facilities, etc. These sectors have a substantial growth potential; with the liberation of private initiative, they could start serious development. In 9 months of 2002, outputs of trade grew especially fast \u2014 by 11.8%. Transit services are very important for the economy of Latvia. They constitute approximately 15% of revenues from exports of goods and services or approximately 7% of GDP. The year 2001 was very successful for the transit business (amounts of exported and imported cargo in Latvian ports went up by 9.8%). In 2002, the situation changed dramatically: volumes of reloaded cargo in Latvian ports decreased (by 8.4%). This was mainly caused by the decrease of Russian oil exports through Ventspils port. Estimations show that without this decline in transit and if transit had stayed on the level of the previous year, the total GDP growth in 2002 would have been 0.5% higher. Economic growth in Latvia has been achieved in conditions of a stable macroeconomic environment. The exchange rate of the lats (LVL) has remained stable for many years against the SDR currency basket. This eliminates uncertainty, reduces currency risk and provides businesses with a stable base for planning and price setting. The Bank of Latvia has decided to keep this currency peg until the country\u2019s accession into the European Union. 154 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Inflation Inflation in Latvia is amongst the lowest in the group of countries with transition economies. Average annual inflation in the last 4 years has stayed within the limits of 2-3%. It is expected that similar levels will also be retained in the coming years. Average annual consumer price inflation was 2.4% in 1999, 2.6% in 2000, 2.5% in 2001 and 1.9% in 2002 (Ministry of Economics, 2002). Improvement of the economic environment, low inflation and growing supply of credits, together with increasing competition in the banking sector, has promoted a gradual reduction of interest rates on credits and extension of crediting deadlines. Figure 2 Average weighted quarterly interest rates on credits in credit institutions (%) Short term Long term Source: Ministry of Economics (2002) To encourage a further decline in interest rates, the Bank of Latvia on 16 September 2002 brought down the previously set interest rates by 0.5 percentage points. Consequently, the refinancing rate (which signals to money market participants about the upper limit of inter-bank market interest rates) is 3% per year. Average weighted annual interest rates for short-term loans in LVL in November 2002 was 6.3%; for long-term loans, 7.8%; and for loans in OECD currencies, 5.9% and 5.8% respectively ( see Figure 2 ). Further decline of interest on loans in the coming years will depend on the pace of formation of the domestic savings and competition in the banking sector. Long-term crediting and further reduction of interest rates is hindered by scarcity of long-term resources in banks (the majority of bank deposits are demand or short-term deposits), high costs of raised resources and the risk that the lent capital will not be returned (no credit history, no collateral, etc.). 155 Social dialogue and EMU in Latvia 8 10 12 14 16 18 I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III In LVL In OECD currencies 1999 1998 2000 2001 2002 6 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III In LVL In OECD currencies 1999 1998 2000 2001 2002 ",
        "Average weighted annual interest rates for short-term deposits in LVL in credit institutions in November 2002 were 2.8%; for long-term deposits, 5.2%; and for deposits in OECD currencies, 2% and 3.9% respectively (Ministry of Economics, 2002). Budget deficit Latvia implements a fiscal policy oriented towards reduction of budget deficit. Fiscal deficit of the general government budget since 1996 (except 1999) has been lower than the level identified in the Maastricht Treaty (3% of GDP). Budget implementation in 2002 led to the deficit in this year equalling 2.5% of GDP ( see Table 1 ). In 2003, the deficit is forecast at 3% of GDP. Growth of deficit in 2003 compared to 2002 is explained by the need to continue funding the started state-funded reforms, integration into NATO and the European Union, increase wages of teachers and health care workers, etc. Besides, the government plans to raise wages of people employed in the special civil service of the Ministry of Interior and finance some other new activities aimed at implementation of government priorities for the total amount of 50 million LVL. Taking into consideration the fact that in 2003 it is planned to decrease corporate income tax rates and compulsory social contribution payments, the deficit in 2003 may decrease only in the case of successful budget execution (Ministry of Economics, 2002). Public debt Central government debt remains on a rather low level \u2014 approximately 14.7% of GDP at the end of 2002 ( see Table 1 ). In recent years, the central government debt has risen from 372.6 million LVL at the end of 1998 to 712.9 million LVL at the end of 2001 ( see Table 2 ). The growth of debt in 2001 was primarily linked with the emission of new 7-year maturity Eurobonds for the amount of e 200 million.

        "The central government debt in Latvia is relatively low (15% of GDP at the end of 2001). Government external debt is 64% of total government debt and internal debt is, respectively, 36%. In 2002, the total central government debt went up by 43.3 million LVL, reaching 756 million LVL at the end of 2002. In 2002, the ratio of the central government debt to GDP decreased in comparison to 2001. Table 3 contains costs related to the central government debt. Clearly, costs are going up along with the increase of the debt. In 2002, the projected growth of costs of debt servicing is mainly linked with the need to finance the above-mentioned issue of Eurobonds in 2001. Table 3 Costs of servicing central government debt (in million LVL) 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002* Central government debt servicing in million LVL 23.6 24.6 39.1 39.3 43.9 % of the general government consolidated budget expenditures 1.5 1.4 2.2 2.2 2.2 % of GDP 0.7 0.6 0.9 0.8 0.8 * Forecast by the Ministry of Finance Source : Ministry of Economics (2002) The Ministry of Finance, assuming that the fiscal deficit of the budget is not going to exceed 3% of GDP, projects gradual growth of the state debt to 20% in the medium term (to 2007). Moreover, it is forecast that the share of debt denominated in the national currency in the portfolio of the state debt will go up. It is anticipated that in the coming years the costs related to servicing of the state debt will also go up (on average by 10 million LVL every year), reaching 90 million LVL per year in 2007 (Ministry of Economics, 2002). Exchange rate stability Fluctuations of exchange rate of the lats against SDR are not allowed since the day of pegging the LVL to SDR 1 in February 1994. The choice of the peg made by the Bank of Latvia in favour of SDR was caused by the fact that in the financial markets SDR is recognised as a \u2018contemporary golden standard\u2019. Furthermore, by pegging to SDR the lats has become more stable in regard to any individual currency of the basket than if it was pegged to a single currency. Exchange rate fluctuations against individual currencies of the basket depend only on fluctuations in the world money market. The Bank of Latvia functions in a similar way to a currency board, freely buying and selling foreign currency. According to the opinion of experts, the fact that the lats has not been officially pegged to SDR (in contrast to Estonia and Lithuania, where the type of fixing of national currencies is stricter, the so-called currency control system) has certain advantages. It allows faster adjustment to unpredictable situations (such as active currency speculation) and wider activities in the monetary sphere, for example, to regulate liquidity of banks with the help of open market operations. 157 Social dialogue and EMU in Latvia 1 SDR currency basket in January 2001 consisted of: the US dollar (45%), the euro (29%), the Japanese yen (15%) and the British pound (11%). ",
        "To keep a fixed exchange rate, a sufficient amount of foreign reserves is needed. The coverage of reserve money (currency in circulation and deposits in the Bank of Latvia) with net foreign reserves at the end of October 2002 was 110%. Foreign currency reserves are kept in all SDR currency basket currencies in proportion to their presence in the basket. Foreign reserves of the Bank of Latvia (including gold reserves) at the end of October 2002 was 1,227 million USD (at the end of 2001, 1,218 million USD; at the end of 2000, 919 million USD; at the end of 1999, 913 million USD). Accession of Latvia to the European Union will require as the next step joining the EMU. Therefore, pegging the lats to the euro is inevitable. Already, there are no technical obstacles to peg the lats to the euro. However, the Bank of Latvia has made a decision to keep the peg to the SDR currency basket until Latvia accedes to the EU (Ministry of Economics, 2002). According to the latest information received from the Bank, if the question on joining the EU is answered in the affirmative by the referendum scheduled for 20 September 2003, lats could be pegged to euro from 1 January 2005 and euro could be introduced on 1 January 2008 (\u2018Business Diena\u2019 ( Lieti \u2030\u02d9\u00c7 Diena ), 16 June 2003). Political situation Latvia is a parliamentary republic with a parliament playing the central role in Latvian politics. The President is elected and can be dismissed by Parliament, and the Cabinet of Ministers needs the continued confidence of Parliament to fulfil its duties. The role of President as regards the Cabinet is limited to choosing the Prime Minister (but he obviously cannot choose a candidate who has no hope of mustering the majority vote in Parliament) and, in addition, the President has the right to convene extraordinary meetings of the Cabinet, presiding over such meetings and determining their agenda. While the President may be dismissed by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of Parliament, he has no corresponding right to dissolve Parliament; he may only propose its dissolution and risks losing his own office if the majority of votes cast in the referendum opposes the dissolution. The results of the October 2002 elections were a surprise, as neither the Social Democratic party (currently one of 3 social democratic parties who came first in the municipal elections in 2001) nor the union \u2018Latvia\u2019s Way\u2019 overcame the 5% threshold, with only 6 parties or pre-election coalitions (including 2 newcomers formed specifically for these elections) making it. After the split of the union \u2018For Human Rights in a United Latvia\u2019 in February 2003, there are 7 parties currently represented in the 100-member Saeima (the Latvian Parliament), with the distribution of seats as follows: (cid:2) New Era party: 26 seats (cid:2) The People\u2019s party: 20 seats (cid:2) The People\u2019s Harmony party: 17 seats (cid:2) Union of Greens and Farmers: 12 seats (cid:2) First party: 10 seats (cid:2) For Human Rights in a United Latvia: 8 seats (cid:2) For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK: 7 seats The government was formed by the centre-right coalition comprising New Era, the First Party, the Union of Greens and Farmers Union, and the Fatherland and Freedom Party. It is led by the leader 158 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "of the New Era party (formed only a couple of months before the elections), ex-president of the central bank, Einars Repse. The Repse coalition has a small majority (55 seats out of 100) and political analysts forecast that the new government could be quite weak as the opposition is quite strong and the coalition parties representing different economic interest groups have divergent opinions on many key issues. During the election campaign, Repse had promised he would not take into the government any party from the previous government (which means primarily the People\u2019s Party, since the Fatherland and Freedom Party has become a coalition member) and similarly the coalition with For Human Rights in a United Latvia (before the split) was impossible because of its supposed pro-Moscow leanings. After the split-up of the union For Human Rights in a United Latvia, the People\u2019s Harmony party is trying to distance itself from its former allies, hoping to break out of the long-lasting isolation and continuous work in the opposition, and the resignation of the leader of the People\u2019s party, Andris Skele, in January 2003 might have removed a serious obstacle for the co-operation of the otherwise similarly positioned New Era party and the People\u2019s party. This means that changes in government composition are not improbable, although the coalition parties claim to expect the current government to survive the whole term of the parliament. The presidential elections in June 2003 turned out not to be the event to bring any such changes, as all of the parties represented in the parliament had already expressed their continuous support to the incumbent; the attempt to re- elect the president early (in March) \u2018in order to guarantee the stability\u2019, as it was explained to the media, encountered considerable opposition and was denounced by lawyers as unconstitutional. The issue of EMU has not been very high on the government\u2019s agenda, probably because of the lack of need to hurry things before Latvia has actually become a member state of the EU. While all of the parties represented in Parliament have expressed their support for joining the EU and the accession treaty was signed in Athens on 16 April 2003, the issue of joining has still to survive the final test of a referendum. A referendum on joining the EU is currently scheduled for 20 September 2003 and the amendments to the constitution (enabling such referenda and requiring a turnout of at least half of those voters who voted in the previous parliamentary elections 2 ) were adopted in early May. The amendments contain a clause stating that \u2018significant changes in the membership conditions\u2019 may be decided by a referendum if half of the members of Parliament so request; this means that it might be possible to interpret this clause permitting also a referendum on joining the EMU; however, it is not very probable that the majority of Parliament would wish to delegate away the decision on this issue to the referendum. In any case, it is expected that in the event of joining the EU, the euro will not be introduced sooner than 2008 ( see above ). Public opinion polls indicate that about 50.2% of eligible voters support joining the EU, about 33% would vote against it, while 17% have not made up their minds yet. 3 There are no polls available on the public support for EMU. 159 Social dialogue and EMU in Latvia 2 Based on the figures of the 2002 elections, this would be a minimum of 498,877 voters, with the favourable vote of the majority of these required. 3 Data as of March 2003, news agency Leta: The support to the membership of Latvia in the EU is stable, 9 April 2003, available at http://www.leta.lv/latvian/zinas/newsitem.asp?NewsID=2003040914020902D8F07A34F45595CC&Phase=+referendums ",
        "Industrial relations Labour relations are regulated by a number of laws, including the new labour law (in force since 1 June 2002), law on trade unions, law on employers\u2019 associations, law on strikes, labour conflict law, law on labour inspectorate and law on labour protection. Trade unions are regulated by the 1990 law on trade unions. The minimum requirement, pursuant to Art. 3 of this law, for the establishment of a trade union (and its registration and conferral on it of the legal personality) is that the union unite not less than 50 members or not less than one- fourth of the workforce in an enterprise, institution, organisation, profession or branch. Among the main rights of the trade unions are the right to participate in the elaboration of labour-related state programmes and laws, to represent their members in relations with employers and to defend their labour, professional and social rights and interests in the state\u2019s institutions and other organisations relevant for labour relations, in cases of compensation of occupational injury, housing and other social and economic interests, individual and collective disputes, and to apply to the courts on behalf of their members, as well as the right to declare a strike. Employers\u2019 organisations are regulated by the 1999 law on employers\u2019 associations. Pursuant to this law, an employer\u2019s organisation can be by at least 5 employers (natural or legal persons who employ at least one person on the basis of an employment contact), while at least 3 organisations may form an employers\u2019 association; an employer who employs at least 50 persons can be a member of the association even if he is not a member of any employers\u2019 organisation. At national level, the interests of employers are represented by the association of employers\u2019 organisations, uniting employers that employ the largest proportion of persons in the country \u2014 the Latvian Employers\u2019 Confederation or LDDK. The law also specifies that the employers\u2019 organisations represent the interests of their members in the relations with trade unions, state institutions and local government institutions when issues related to the functions of employers\u2019 organisations and their associations are discussed, co-operate with the trade unions in collective bargaining and participate in settlement of labour disputes, including cases of strikes. The labour law provides for the right of both employers and employees to unite in organisations and provides that employees may be represented by either a trade union or authorised representatives (they can be elected if at least 5 employees are employed at the undertaking; both of these \u2014 trade union representatives and \u2018authorised representatives\u2019 \u2014 will be called \u2018representatives\u2019 from here on, unless mentioned otherwise), or both, if both exist at the undertaking. The representatives have the right, inter alia, to receive information in good time and consult with the employer before the employer takes such decisions as may affect the interests of employees, in particular a decision which may substantially affect work remuneration, working conditions and employment in the undertaking; to take part in the determination and improvement of work remuneration provisions, working environment, working conditions and organisation of working time, as well as in protecting the safety and health of employees; and to monitor how regulatory enactments, the collective agreement and working procedure regulations are being observed in employment legal relationships. Part B of the law is devoted to collective agreements. Collective agreements are concluded by the employer and a trade union or by authorised employee representatives if the employees have not formed a trade union; unless provided otherwise in the collective agreement, its provisions apply 160 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "to all employees who are employed by the relevant employer or in a relevant undertaking of the employer. It is only permitted to derogate from the provisions of a collective agreement if the provisions of the individual employment contract are more favourable to the employee. The initiative to conclude a collective agreement may come from the employee representatives (including trade unions) or the employer; the employer may not refuse to enter into negotiations regarding the entering into of a collective agreement. The collective agreement agreed upon has to be approved by a simple majority of the general meeting of the employees at which at least half of the employees participate, or at the meeting of the representatives of the employees. Disputes arising from the collective agreement relations are settled by a conciliation commission established by the parties to a collective agreement, who both authorise an equal number of their representatives; if the dispute is not solved by the conciliation commission, it is settled by a court or arbitration. The procedure is regulated in more detail by the law on labour conflicts. A collective agreement in a sector or territory (general agreement) is concluded by an employer, a group of employers, an organisation of employers or an association of organisations of employers, and an employee trade union or an association (union) of employee trade unions if the parties to the general agreement have relevant authorisation or if the right to enter into a general agreement is provided for by the articles of association of such associations (unions); a general agreement thus concluded is binding on members of the organisation or the association. The labour law also provides for a legal extension mechanism: if members of an organisation of employers or an association of organisations of employers employ more than 60% of the employees in a sector, a general agreement entered into between the organisation of employers or association of organisations of employers and an employee trade union or an association (union) of employee trade unions is binding on all employers of the relevant sector and applies to all employees employed by the employers. At national level, the partner representing the employees is the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia (LBAS), which currently has 195,695 members from 26 member organisations and unites all of the trade unions in Latvia ( see http:// www.labas.lv). The Latvian Employers\u2019 Confederation (LDDK) currently unites 56 employers and 19 employers\u2019 associations, employing about 330,000 employees 4 , which based on the data of the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia (989,000 people employed in 2002) amounts to one-third of the total number of people employed. Both the LBAS and LDDK participate in the National Tripartite Co- operation Council based on an Agreement signed between LBAS, LDDK and the government on 30 October 1998, and they have also concluded a number of general agreements. Of these, the general agreement on basic principles of social partnership concluded in 1996 and determining the procedure of bargaining the collective agreements and dispute settlement on all levels deserves to be mentioned separately; this agreement, inter alia, provides that LBAS and LDDK conclude each year a general agreement on the minimum wage and its increase, depending on inflation, unless the general agreement provides that it remains in force until the conclusion of the next agreement. The level of trade union membership in Latvia was estimated to be 25% in 2002 5 (Antila and Ylostato, 2003), with the figure of 38% in the public sector and as low as 8% in the private sector. 161 Social dialogue and EMU in Latvia 4 Data provided by the representative of the LDDK. 5 This figure contradicts that provided by LBAS: according to their data, the union membership is about 20%. ",
        "Collective agreements exist in 26% of workplaces (37% and 19% in the public and private sectors respectively), their total number being 2,018 at the company level and 10 at sectoral level by January 2000 (Chassard, 2001); the number of sectoral agreements had increased to 32 at the beginning of the year 2003, the total number of collective agreements amounting to 2,368 (Ministry of Welfare, based on information received from LBAS). In addition, a number of bilateral agreements, including several on minimal wages (exceeding the minimal age set by the government), have been concluded by LBAS and LDDK. The percentage of employees covered by the collective agreements was estimated to be under 20% in 2001 ( ibid .) and currently, pursuant to the data of LBAS, covers 187,674 employees \u2014 still only 19%, despite the fact that, unless provided otherwise by the agreement, pursuant to the labour law a collective agreement concluded at company level applies to all persons employed at the company. Thus, it can be concluded that both unionisation and coverage rates are still very low. There does exist a framework of organisations on both sides at a sectoral level. Although in general almost every organisation has its corresponding partner (on the employees\u2019 side, several sectors are internally divided, with several unions in the same branch, for example, two trade unions in the health care sector), currently social dialogue at sectoral level is only just beginning, despite the increase of the number of agreements at sectoral level to 23 in the year 2002. One of the reasons for this appears to be a lack of resources. At regional level, the situation appears to be even worse; no organisational framework exists on either side. Collective action primarily takes place at company level, as indicated by the number of collective agreements concluded at this level (more than 2,000), but at the same time coverage is still clearly insufficient. The net wage earned by people employed in the national economy in 2001 was almost one and a half times higher (by 46%) than in 1996 ( see Table 4 ). It continued growing in 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the net wage was 6.3% higher than in the third quarter of the preceding year. Real income of people employed, adjusted for inflation, in recent years has gone up by 3.5% per annum. Wages of people employed in the public sector went up faster than in the private sector.

        "Starting with 1 January 2003, the minimum wage approved in the country was raised from 60 LVL to 70 LVL. The previous time such an increase took place was on 1 July 2001 (Ministry of Economics, 2002). The agreement on the National Tripartite Co-operation Council (NTSP) signed between LBAS, LDDK and the government on 30 October 1998 is the basis of the tripartite system at national level. The main objective of the NTSP is to promote co-operation between government, employers\u2019 organisations and trade unions at national level in order to reach consensus on solving the socio- economic issues of the country. Among the functions of the NTSP are conciliation in cases of collective disputes, promotion of co-operation at sectoral and regional level, discussion and making proposals regarding the concept papers, programmes, draft legal acts, draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers on social security, state budget guidelines, economic development and regional strategy, health promotion, development of general and professional education, employment and professional qualification, enforcement of ILO Conventions and government reports on implementation of those conventions, the government\u2019s reports relating to the international instruments of the Council of Europe, and the implementation of the recommendations of the international institutions. The NTSP may also demand from the sector- based ministries the postponement of the submission of draft legal acts to the government in order to put them on the agenda of the Council. The NTSP consists of 7 members nominated by the government, 7 representatives of LBAS and 7 members of LDDK. The NTSP meets every 1-3 months. There are 4 subcommittees: vocational education and employment, employment relations, social security and health care. The decisions of the NTSP are made by consensus and are binding on the participants. At regional level, a tripartite regional council exists only in one place (Cesis), based on a special tripartite agreement. Thus, it would be safe to say that tripartism is only developed to national level. Both the trade unions and LDDK favour the accession of Latvia to the EU and both are interested in social dialogue as part of the way towards the EU and EMU, aiming at influencing the social and economic policy, creating benevolent social conditions, raising productivity and fostering employment, effectiveness of business and the necessary restructuring. However, while there are promising trends, social dialogue still needs to be developed at all levels to be able to cope effectively with these tasks; while the legal basis for it exists, public awareness-raising and training measures are needed since it would be difficult for the government to implement its policies without the support of the population mustered, inter alia, through social dialogue. Conclusion The economic reforms have had a positive effect on the economic development of Latvia. Of the EMU criteria, Latvia currently fulfils all but one: the low interest rate target, the interest rate for long-term still being 7.8% in lats and 5.8% in OECD currencies. From the political point of view, all parliamentary parties favour accession to the EU; the decisive say, however, will be made at the referendum, scheduled for 20 September 2003. The issue of joining the EMU has not really been on the agenda yet. Speaking of industrial relations, while the legal basis for social dialogue is in place, there is still hardly any dialogue at the sectoral and none at the regional level; while the 163 Social dialogue and EMU in Latvia ",
        "bilateral and tripartite dialogue at national level has been a success so far, the number of collective agreements concluded at company level still remains low, as is their coverage and membership of trade unions. This indicates that, in order for the social dialogue to be able to support the EMU convergence process, steps need to be taken to foster social dialogue \u2014 for the benefit of all parties involved. 164 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

        "166 What? At the Vienna workshop, representatives of the social partners agreed that what is needed in Latvia, given its particular situation with underdeveloped social dialogue at sectoral level, is the \u2018enhancement of social and economic development by means of strengthening sectoral social dialogue\u2019 . Why? \u2018One size does not fit all\u2019. Currently, the social dialogue in Latvia still takes place primarily at company level. The social partners\u2019 organisations at national level are strong. Thus, the weak point in Latvia is at the sectoral level. This should be addressed to actually ensure social and economic convergence conducive for Latvia\u2019s future joining the EMU. When? The time frame for implementation of the National Development Plan is 2003-2007. Implementation would take pace in two phases: 1) 2003-2005: Strengthening of sectoral social partners\u2019 organisations. This would comprise the following: (cid:2) consolidation; (cid:2) elaboration of position papers and programmes; (cid:2) comunication with the members; and (cid:2) gaining the support of the members. 2) 2005-2007: Negotiations between the social partners at sectoral level. By the end of this period, there should be strong social partners at the sectoral level, capable of ongoing dialogue. Who? National social partners\u2019 organisations will provide an impetus to the sectoral-level organisations, who would take over the responsibility for successful implementation of the National Development Plan. Where? At national level, the actors responsible for implementation would be the national social partners (Latvian Employers\u2019 Confederation or LDDK and the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia or LBAS), as well as their sectoral-level organisations. Which? Prior to accession, national resources as well as pre-accession funds will be the main resources; after accession, EU funds will replace the pre-accession funds as the main source of financial resources. Annex 1 National Development Plan: Enhancement of social and economic development through strengthening the sectoral social dialogue ",
        "Boguslavas Gruzevskis and Inga Blaziene, Institute of Labour and Social Research, Vilnius Following independence in 1990, Lithuania has made significant progress in the development of a dialogue between the social partners and in lessening gaps between capital and labour. The transition process imparted a new quality to industrial relations between employees and employers. It can be said that a new regulatory system of industrial relations in Lithuania has been created and this is continually being improved. By the end of 1991, the following new basic laws were adopted: Law on Supporting the Unemployed, Law on Individual Income Security, Law on Collective Agreements, Law on Trade Unions, Law on Employment Contract, Law on Holidays. Nearly all the regulations and amendments in this field were drafted by the government together with representatives of trade union and employer organisations. The development of industrial relations in Lithuania has gradually increased opportunities for direct dialogue between employees and employers. It should be noted, however, that social dialogue is being developed \u2018from the top down\u2019, which is characteristic of other candidate states as well, and not \u2018from the bottom up\u2019, which is characteristic of a number of western and northern European countries. The development of social dialogue at enterprise level in Lithuania, a pre-requisite for EMU, is therefore at a very early stage yet. Despite political differences, all political actors were positive about the co-operation of social partners in the development of industrial relations and easing of social tensions in the country. In practice, however, after the collapse of the Soviet trade union system, opportunities for employees to have a direct effect on employers\u2019 decisions decreased, and the role of the government in the sphere of employee relations regulations increased considerably. Following the coming into government of a right-wing party in 1996 there were discussions about liberalising industrial relations and this trend has continued. Today, representatives of the right and left speak out in favour of more flexible employee relations\u2019 regulation. The new Labour Code in force from 2003 had a major impact on developments in social dialogue. The Code places special importance on collective industrial relations and mutual agreements by all parties. The new Labour Code validates the liberalisation of industrial relations on one hand, while on the other hand it increases the social guarantees of employment. Since 1995, indices characterising economic development in the country have been showing constant growth (except for 1998-1999): GDP has been growing since 2000, investment into different economic activities and regions is increasing on an ongoing basis, decreased inflation turned into deflation in 2002, the public budget revenue has been growing since 2001. In 2002 unemployment dropped and the numbers in employment increased. Despite promising macroeconomic indices for the country, Lithuania today still has a high level of unemployment coupled with relatively low wages and few social benefits. In order to consolidate social partnership and the regulation of industrial relations through collective bargaining, the Lithuanian government approved the 2003-2004 \u2018Implementation Plan for the Development of Government, Trade Unions and Employer\u2019s Organisations for Social Partnership\u2019 at a meeting of the Tripartite Council on January 2003. This plan sets out the further development of the institutional system of social partnership as well as the improvement of the Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania 167 6 ",
        "legal and normative framework. Importance is given to the enhancement of collective industrial relations, promoting awareness and education among the social partners. However, it should be noted that the promotion of co-operation between the social partners has not been active enough to date. Political situation On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council of Lithuania (Reconstituent Seimas) adopted the Decree on the Reconstitution of the Independent State of Lithuania, making Lithuania an independent democratic republic. At present there are about 40 political parties and organisations registered in Lithuania. The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania is comprised of 141 representatives of the people elected for a four year-tenure on the basis of universal, equal, direct suffrage and by means of a secret ballot. Since 1990 there have been several sessions of the Seimas in the Republic of Lithuania: (cid:2) 1990-1992 \u2013 the Supreme Council of Lithuania (Reconstituent Seimas); (cid:2) 1992-1996 Seimas session; (cid:2) 1996-2000 Seimas session. In the 1992-1996 elections, the left-wing political forces gained a majority, while in the 1996-2000 election, the right-wing political forces won. The present Seimas\u2019 tenure has been elected for 2000-2004. This is comprised of seven parties and a mixed group of Seimas members comprising members of the Seimas who do not belong to any party. The division of the Seimas members by parliamentary groups is shown in the figure below. After the 2000 parliamentary elections, the ruling coalition of the Seimas was made up of five parties: the New Union (Social Liberals), the Lithuanian Liberal Union, the Centre Union of Lithuania, the Union of Modern Christian Democrats and the Election Action of Lithuania\u2019s Poles. On 22 June 2001, the last four of these parties made a declaration to the effect that the New Union (Social Liberals) was no longer a partner of the coalition. On 27 June 2001 the leaders of the social democrats and social liberals signed an agreement on common operating objectives, the aforementioned parties comprising the majority in the Seimas. The ruling majority of the Seimas is the one forming the present Lithuanian government. Despite fluctuations in political power, the main political parties in Lithuania agree on the priority perspectives concerning development in Lithuania. On 3 December 2002, the principal political parties of Lithuania (the Lithuanian Liberal Union, the Lithuanian Liberal-Democratic Party, the Lithuanian Social-Democratic Party, the Modern Christian-Democratic Party, the New Union Party (Social Liberals), the Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives)) and public organisations jointly signed the National Agreement on Economic and Social Development. The National Agreement was drafted on the basis of the currently approved development strategies for the country: the strategy for economic development of Lithuania up to 2015 and long-term national development strategy. 168 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

The National Agreement highlights the importance of knowledge and the rapid development of human capital as the key to a successful and forward-looking economy and society in Lithuania. The National Agreement provides for the availability of national resources and funds subsequent to Lithuania\u2019s accession to the European Union. Economic situation Gross domestic product (GDP) Gross domestic product is a key indicator in evaluating the outcomes of economic reform and the achievement of economic potential.

Increased industry and export growth, increased cargo circulation in the Klaip \u00f2 da Port as well as other factors determined later growth in the real GDP. According to provisional data from Lithuanian statistics, total GDP in Lithuania in 2002 was 14,648 million euros, GDP per capita was 4,223 euros. Compared to 2001, the actual increase amounted to 5.9%. According to experts, this GDP growth has to do with increased domestic consumption and development in 99 out of a 100 economic sectors.

Inflation Strict fiscal and monetary policy in Lithuania resulted in a significant decrease in the inflation level recorded since 1995 (Figure 4). But the factor determining consumer prices in 1996 \u2013 2001 was a rather limited solvent demand in the domestic market. Figure 4 Rates of consumer price dynamics per annum (%) Source: Web page of the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Lithuania In 2002 Lithuanian encountered deflation , i.e., prices of goods and services dropped by 1% over a year (December 2002 compared to December 2001) and this was the first deflation recorded during the 12 years of Lithuania\u2019s independence. Such a change in prices in 2002 was basically due to cheap foodstuffs and soft drinks (-5.3%), clothes and footwear (-2.4%), education (-5.3%), diverse goods and services (-2.7%). On the other hand, transport prices increased by 9.4%, healthcare services by 3.8%, strong drinks and tobacco products by 2.1%, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel charges by 1.5%. Here it should be noted that in the summer and beginning of the autumn, vegetables, fruits, berries, milk and dairy product were subjected to seasonal price-cutting. A low level of inflation was also influenced by the abundant supply of consumer goods, competition from sales and the high rate of the Lita currency with regard to the US dollar. Although in 2002 consumer prices dropped by 1%, analysts say that in Lithuania deflation is not as dangerous as in industrialised countries, where economy is inert. Moreover, several years\u2019 deflation is necessary for its impact to be felt 171 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania -100 10 20 30 40 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 35.7 13.1 8.4 2.4 0.3 1.4 2 -1 ",

Data about the public deficit of the country is presented in the figure below. Figure 5 Ratio between public budget deficit/excess with GDP (%) On 31 December 2002 the public debt amounted to LTL 13 162.8 million and accounted for 26% of the forecasted GDP. For comparison, at the end of 2001 the aggregated debt amounted to LTL 12 903.7 million or 26.9% of the GDP. Exchange rate In preparation for accession to the EU, Lithuania intends to maintain the fixed exchange rate. In order to promote further integration into the EU market, the anchor currency was changed from the US dollar to the euro on 2 February 2002. The system of litas exchange rate fixed to EUR will create the conditions to participate in the Exchange Rate Mechanism-2 following Lithuania\u2019s accession to the EU and introduce EUR in future. Currently, the exchange rate of 1 EUR is 3.452 litas. Labour market Employment The average annual number of employed persons in the Lithuanian economy is presented in Figure 6 opposite. The number of employed persons in the Lithuanian economy began to decrease from 1998 \u2013 the year of economic crisis in the country. The employment rate in Lithuania in 2002 was 49.9%.

On the contrary, alongside the growing economy in 2000-2001, unemployment reached one of its highest ever levels: the unemployment rate (by both the Labour Force Survey as well as Labour Exchange data) has exceeded the 10% margin since December 1999 (see Figure 7). An increase in employment and decrease unemployment were manifested only two years after the beginning of the economic growth, i.e., in 2002. Currently (at the beginning of 2003) the unemployment rate is about 12% according to the National Labour Exchange data and about 14% according to the Labour Force Survey.

In addition, there is a high regional unemployment rate differentiation in the country (see Figure 8).

        "The average earnings in the country were affected by the impact of economic crisis and earnings in 2001 did not reach the level of 1999. Gross average monthly wages and salaries in 2002 were 1 034 litas (300 EUR), net wages and salaries 741 litas (215 EUR). Compared to 2001, the nominal gross average monthly wages and salaries increased by 5.2%, net \u2013 by 6.0%. The real growth of average wages and salaries during this period was more than 7%. This was influenced by the growth of nominal wages and salaries, by the increase of non-taxable income minimum and changes in consumer prices. Highest earnings in Lithuania by economic activity are in financial intermediation and public administration and defence; the lowest are in fishing, hotels and restaurants and agriculture, hunting and forestry. Minimum wage Currently, the minimum monthly wage in Lithuania amounts to 430 litas (125 EUR), and the minimum pay per hour is 2.53 litas (0.73 EUR). The last increase in the minimum monthly wage and minimum pay per hour was in 1998. Due to the impact of the economic crisis on the Lithuanian economy in 1999, the planned increase in the MMW did not take place. At the moment the Lithuanian Tripartite Council is considering the possibility of increasing the MMW to 450 litas, but this is impeded by the fact that the MMW has to do with the salaries of a number of individuals operating in the public sector (politicians, judges, civil servants and public officers) \u2013 the official salary of these employees is fixed at a particular figure. Therefore, the possibility of separating the pay of individuals employed in the public sector from the minimum monthly wage is currently being considered. While the minimum monthly wage has not been increased, its real amount has been increasing since 2002. From December 2001 to December 2002 the real amount of the MMW increased by 4.5%. This growth was determined by the 2002 deflation and increase in minimum tax-free income (on April 2002 the minimum tax-free income was increased by 17%). Labour costs One of the reasons for low average as well as minimum wages levels is the relatively high labour costs in the country. There are three basic categories of wages and salaries: 1. net wages and salaries; 2. gross wages and salaries; 3. employers\u2019 costs for wages and salaries. Figure 10 overleaf graphically illustrates the inter-reliance of these categories. 175 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania ",

The breakdown of employers\u2019 costs for the minimum wage in Lithuania is presented in Figure 11. As this figure illustrates, income tax and social security contributions in Lithuania amount to as much as 36.5% of aggregated employers\u2019 costs for minimum wages and salaries.

Minimum wage determination in Lithuania As we can see from the figure above, growth in the level of income tax and social security contributions alongside the growth in gross wages and salaries is extremely high \u2013 up to 1000 litas (which corresponds approximately to the average wages and salaries in the country), and then this progressive growth declines, i.e., taxation of labour force is more relevant to employees with high wages and salaries (1000 litas and more). In this context we can clearly see the disproportion between the level of labour and capital taxation: if taxation of the labour force is one of the highest in Europe (40-50% at an average of total employer\u2019s costs for wages and salaries), the level of profit taxation in the country is as low as 15% and is one of the lowest among European countries. According to the authors, this disproportion has to a large extent to do with a situation where employers are interested in hiding wages and salaries paid to employees as much as possible, and this in turn results in a number of social problems: insufficient social guarantees for the employed, extremely low pensions in the country, etc. It should be noted that irrespective of an increase in the basic tax-free minimum income at the beginning 2003 (from 250 to 290 litas), this disproportion slightly dropped but however remains quite high. Moreover, the increase in the tax-free minimum income was only concerned with net wages and salaries received by employees, while total costs of the employer were not reduced. Employers\u2019 social security contributions accounting for the major part of indirect employers\u2019 costs for wages and salaries had not changed either. As for inequality of labour and capital taxation, a problem of capital mobility is involved: if the level of capital taxation is increased, under conditions of global economy capital can easily flow to countries where taxation conditions are more favourable. 177 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 430 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 2200 2400 2600 2800 3000 3200 3400 3600 3800 4000 4200 4400 4600 4800 5000 % Gross wages and salaries (in Litas) ",

The state-supported minimum standard of living in 2002 has not been changed and amounted to 125 litas (36 EUR). From December 2001 to December 2002, its actual amount increased by 1%. Real social benefits increased by the same amount, as they depend on the state-supported minimum standard of living. During 2002 the basic national social security pension increased by 9 litas (2.6 EUR) and at the moment amounts to 147 litas (43 EUR). The increase in the basic pension conditioned an increase in relief pensions and caring benefits. Over the same period the relief pensions increased by 2.9%, while caring benefits increased by 4.3%. Average monthly social security pension of unemployed retired persons in the third quarter of 2002 amounted to 324 litas (94 EUR). The real amount of the old age pension increased by 2.8% compared to the third quarter of 2001. Industrial relations The reconstitution of independent Lithuania was followed by a certain vacuum in the level of social partner co-operation, conditioned by the politics, economic relations and social status of the Soviet era. 1990-1991 marked the beginning of the creation of a new system of social partner institutions. The first steps were very difficult in the sense that trade unions, collective industrial relations and involvement of employees in the business management were regarded as elements of the former socialist production management system and thus unsuitable for a market economy. Different measures have been taken (e.g., cancellation of centralised membership fee withholding \u2018in favour of trade unions\u2019) in order to restrict opportunities for the trade unions to have any weight over social and economic processes and in particular with regard to active manifestations at company level. Yet, at the same time in Lithuania another point of view concerning social dialogue was being formed. In analysing the experience of EU and North Europe countries, Lithuanian politicians came to appreciate the importance of social dialogue in democratic society. Soviet dogmas about \u2018trade unions as schools of communism\u2019 were gradually substituted by provisions purporting that the \u2018co-operation of social partners assures harmonious social development and directly serves the interests of the social partners\u2019. Having reviewed the thirteen years\u2019 history of the establishment of and co-operation among social partner institutions, the authors are of the view that in Lithuania more confrontational attitudes have tended to prevail. However, trilateral institutions cover more and more different spheres of activities every year, the variety of social dialogue is improving and the number of collective bargaining is increasing. Employer organisations At the moment there are two principal employers\u2019 organisations in Lithuania. Lithuanian Confederation of Industrialists (LCI) On June 1989, after 60 years, the Constituent Assembly of the Lithuanian Association of Industrialists re-established the Union of Businessmen that had been operating in Lithuania before the war. At present the LCI unites 41 branch and 8 regional associations incorporating more than 178 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "2 700 enterprises of different profiles (it unites most manufacturing companies, banks, trade companies, scientific and education establishments). The LCI is an apolitical public organisation not under the control of the state. It has a significant influence over the Seimas and Government of Lithuania. It is made up of 16 standing committees serviced by managing officers and qualified industrial experts who operate on a voluntary basis. Lithuanian Confederation of Business Employers (LCBE) This organisation was established in 2000 as a result of the merger of two business confederations: the National Business Confederation and the Lithuanian Confederation of Business Employers. The LCBE brings together representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises; it is a union of associations, enterprises and individual persons. A priority trend in LCBE\u2019s activities is the development of SMEs. There is a regional structure of LCBE branches covering 52 regions. The LCBE is represented in the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania, the government, Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania, other state authorities and commissions. The LCBE has 14 operating committees where key priority is given to the drafting of business development standard documents. Trade union organisations Today in Lithuania there are three national-level organisations of trade unions. Lithuanian Confederation of Trade Unions (LCTU) This organisation was established in 2002 in a result of the merger of two national trade union associations: the Lithuanian Association of Trade Unions (a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) from 1994 and an associated member of the European Confederation of Trade Unions (ETUC) from 1998) and the Lithuanian Centre of Trade Unions. At the end of 2002 the LCTU was comprised of 24 branch trade unions uniting 117 thousand members. The LCTU co-operates with the International Labour Organisation, keeps close contacts with Swedish, Danish, German and other foreign trade unions and shares in the activities of trade union councils of Nordic and Baltic countries. Lithuanian Trade Union (LTU) \u2018Solidarumas\u2019 This organisation was up to 2002 known as the Lithuanian Workers\u2019 Union (LWU). At the seventh congress of LWU it was decided to rename the organisation. The LWU was formed as a branch of Lithuanian Revival Movements \u2018S \u00e0 j \uf8ff dis\u2019. The first group of the workers\u2019 union was established in Kaunas in 1988. LTU \u2018Solidarumas\u2019 is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) since 1994 and observer-member of the European Confederation of Trade Unions (ETUC) since 1998. The LTU actively shares in the activities of Baltic trade unions. In 2002 LTU \u2018Solidarumas\u2019 united 52 thousand members at sector and regional level. Lithuanian Federation of Labour (LFL) This was re-established in Lithuania in 1991 (a successor of the Christian Workers\u2019 Trade Union that was established in Lithuania in 1919). In 1995 the LFL merged the Society of Trade Unions and in 1997 the Lithuanian Association of Regional Trade Unions. Since 1996 the LFL has been a member of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). The LFL is also a member of the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania with its representatives in all national-level tripartite councils and commissions. In 2002 the LFL united 20 thousand members at sector and regional level. 179 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania ",
        "Tripartite consultative organisations A system of tripartite organisations in Lithuania is comprised of a number of tripartite councils and commissions, most of them specialised. Most of these organisations are operating at national level, while some of them have extended their activities to a regional level. The Tripartite Council of Vilnius City was established in 2000, followed by Tripartite Council of Vilnius County, being the first county-level council established in 2001. Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania This organisation, also known as the Tripartite Council, was established in 1995 following the agreement on trilateral partnership by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania, trade unions and employers\u2019 organisation and in compliance with the provisions of the International Labour Organisation Convention 144, \u2018On Tripartite Consulting to Implement International Labour Norms\u2019. The Tripartite Council is made up of the parity principle from 15 members (five members delegated by trade unions, national employers\u2019 organisations and the Government). The operations of the Tripartite Council are organised by the Secretariat of the Tripartite Council. There are four standing commissions operating at the Tripartite Council: (cid:2) Wages and salaries; (cid:2) Industrial relations; (cid:2) Employment and social guarantees; By the end of 2002, the Tripartite Council had held 58 sittings where it analysed about 300 socio- economic issues (social security draft laws, motions on social security contributions and minimum monthly wage, draft Law on Guarantee Fund, legal regulation of part-time work, draft of the Labour Code providing for a new concept of tax system, issues related to electricity charges, draft Law on State Labour Inspectorate, etc.). In addition, the standing committees of the Tripartite Council have settled about one hundred issues. The Council of the State Social Insurance Fund (CSSIF) This body was established in 1991 on the basis of the Law on National Social Insurance. It is comprised of 15 equal members representing insured persons, employers and state authorities. The composition of the Council shall be approved by the Minister of Social Security and Labour or a member of the Council authorised by the Minister. In 1998 the CSSIF approved the provisions of territorial councils of the State Social Insurance Fund. The territorial councils of the State Social Insurance Fund are established at regional sections of the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund as public institutions (in cities/towns and regions). Employment Council This is based in the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and was established in 1996 following the provisions of the Law on Support of the Unemployed. This Council deals with employment of the population and factors having any effect on employment. It also makes proposals for improving employment and labour market policy implementation, approves annual estimates of the Employment Fund and evaluation reports, etc. The Employment Council is comprised of 15 equal members and is led by the Minister of Social Security and Labour or a member of the Council authorised by the Minister. 180 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Commission of Employees\u2019 Safety and Health of the Republic of Lithuania (CESHRL) This body was established in 1994 following the provisions of the then valid Law on Human Safety at Work. The CESHRL shares the creation and and implementation of the policy of health and safety at work, making proposals related to laws and other regulations governing safety at work and related issues, analysing the status of safety at work, etc. The CESHRL is comprised of 15 equal members. It is chaired by a chairperson elected on the principle of rotation from the members of the Commission. Following the new Law on the Safety and Health of Employees, territorial tripartite commissions of employees\u2019 safety and health 2002 were established in all ten counties. Council of the Guarantee Fund (CGF) This was established in 2001 following the provisions of the Law on Guarantee Fund. By the year 2001 the fund to satisfy claims of bankrupted companies or companies exposed to bankruptcy proceedings was in operation. The CGF manages the resources of the Guarantee Fund, taking decisions on assignment thereof, etc. The Council is comprised of 12 members and is chaired by a chairperson appointed by the Government from representatives of state authorities. Lithuanian Council of Vocational Training (LCVT) This was established in 1998 following the provisions of the Law on Vocational Training. Its task is to provide consulting, expertise and co-ordination functions in tackling strategic issues concerning vocational training. The Council is made up of 18 members. The material and technical operating conditions of the LCVT is created by the Ministry of Education and Science. In 2001- 2002 the Council operated on an irregular basis while opportunities to make Council\u2019s activities more active were examined. Tripartite Commission at the Lithuanian Labour Exchange (\u2018the National Commission\u2019) This was established in 1991 following the provisions of the then valid Law on Employment of Population. The National Commission is comprised of 9 members. The Commission analyses changes in the Lithuanian labour market, making recommendations to the Lithuanian Labour Exchange and Employment Council with regard to labour market policy implementation, utilisation of the Employment Fund and funding of active measures of the labour market policy. Tripartite commissions at regional labour exchanges have been established (nine cities/towns and regions) to analyse and settle issues concerning implementation of the labour market policy. The said commissions are comprised of six equal members. In Lithuania there are 46 tripartite commissions at the regional labour exchanges. Expert Council at the Lithuanian Labour Market Training Office (\u2018the Expert Council\u2019) This body was established in 1996 and comprises 15 members. The Expert Council is a controlling body, whose key task is to assist in the development of vocational training and labour market consultation in the context of optimal requirements of the labour market. The Expert Council is made up of six regional tripartite expert commissions established at the regional training and consulting offices of the labour market. Compulsory Health Insurance Council (CHIC) This body was established in 1996 year in accordance with the regulations of the Law of Compulsory Health Insurance. According to the regulations of new Law of Compulsory Health Insurance of 2002, CHIC comprises of 16 members. The chairman of the Council is elected from 181 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania ",
        "the members by vote. The status of CHIC is being endorsed by governmental resolution. The work of CHIC is organised by the Health Care Fund under the Ministry of Health. To summarise, in addition to the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania, there are eight tripartite Commissions/Councils operating at national level. The creation of regional tripartite councils has been started recently. however, decision-making (likely to have an impact on EMU) could be in fact influenced by the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania only. In 2002, experts of the ILO headquarters in Budapest carried out assessment of tripartite consultative mechanisms in Lithuania. In their conclusive findings they positively evaluated the system of tripartite consultative organisations in Lithuania and the Tripartite Council and Commission of Employees\u2019 Safety and Health of the Republic of Lithuania in particular. Yet, it was noted that the impact of individual tripartite organisations on final decision-making is not sufficiently emphasised, the functions and rights of individual tripartite organisations are not always clearly defined, and co-operation among tripartite organisations is insufficient. Labour Code The new relations of market economy in Lithuania and dynamics of global economy require flexible legal governing in the field of industrial relations. Therefore, Lithuania inevitably had to reform its labour law according to that of international undertakings. The new Code of Labour, as drafted and approved by the Government in 2001) reformed the labour law in essence, gave a background for innovatory regulation of industrial relations and many other relevant relations. In June 2002, the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania passed the new Labour Code that came into force from 1 January of 2003. The new Labour Code is based upon main legal acts of the European Union and the ILO and provisions of the European Social Charter. The Labour Code pays particular attention to the development of social dialogue and collective industrial relations, and defines for the first time the conception of social partnership and principles of collaboration. Passing of the new Labour Code invalidated the Labour Code 1972 and seven laws adopted since 1990. The Code will have to be supported with newly drafted, adopted or amended some 36 laws and other regulations specifying particular provisions of the Code in more details. According to the new Code, employees could be represented before employers not only by trade unions, but in case of their absence, also by other representatives of employees \u2013 Labour Councils. Employers are allowed to apply more flexible forms of organisation of working hours, and the list of the types of employment contracts is herewith enlarged. The Code amended the principle of payment of severance pays: if employment contract is terminated without any fault of the employee, the severance pay shall be paid subject to continuity of service in the company (from one to six monthly average wage/salary). According to the new Code, in case of any inconsistencies in the regulation governing industrial relations, provisions more favourable for employees shall be applied. In addition, the Government is given an opportunity to fix different minimum wages in different economic branches or individual categories of employees. Consequently, we can state that the new Labour Code created conditions for refusal of too centralised regulation of industrial relations, giving more opportunities to social partners to settle issues related to labour and industrial relations by means of signing bilateral collective agreements in companies at branch, regional and national levels. 182 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Collective bargaining In the system of industrial relations, an important role is played by bilateral and collective industrial relations regulation to ensure the interests of both the employers and employees to optimal level and create conditions for effective production development and utilisation of labour resources. The recent trends in the regulation of industrial relations is that the Government of the Republic of Lithuania tends to regulate legal industrial relations less and less, while more and more matters are under the competence of social partners\u2019 bargaining. It should be noted, however, that collective agreements activity in Lithuania has not been sufficient so far. Up to now, collective agreements were signed mainly at company level. Collective agreements entered into by companies, enterprises and organisations do not exceed 15%. Sectoral agreements are made only in a few sectors (energy, communications, education). And even these are more declarative in their nature. In order to consolidate real social partnership and regulate industrial relations through collective bargaining, the Lithuanian government approved the \u20182003- 2004 Implementation Plan for the Development of Government, Trade Unions and Employers\u2019 Organisations Social Partnership\u2019, which was drawn up at a meeting of the Tripartite Council in January 2003. This plan reflects the future strategy concerning social dialogue in Lithuania, proposes drafting a new version of the Law on Trade Unions, sets forth developing and implementing measures related to the promotion of social dialogue at county and regional levels, including arranging regular meetings of the social partners on issues related to sectoral collective bargaining, and organising training of employers and employees on issues related to social dialogue, etc. The development of collective industrial relations in Lithuania has been facilitated by the trade unions in particular. They carried out several projects in order to improve employees\u2019 capacities to identify and substantiate their requirements in bargaining, studied the methods of the bargaining technique, and held seminars attended by employers\u2019 representatives. The year 2002 marked the beginning of the phase of signing collective agreements with the employers of joint capital enterprises in Lithuania. A seminar was organised together with the TUAC committee at OECD to analyse the peculiarities of bargaining in the aforementioned companies and a guidebook on the subject was issued. In 2002, a model of a collective agreement for industrial enterprises was developed together with the Ministry of Social Security and Labour. Some branch trade unions have released special publications and leaflets on collective bargaining. A situation in the field of collective industrial relations has arisen whereby implementing strikes is seen as the last step in the settlement of collective labour disputes. According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, during the year 2001 there were 34 strikes in the country, including 29 warning strikes, fewer than in 2000 (56 strikes) In 2002 not a single strike was registered. To summarise, we can say that in Lithuania there exists a legal framework for the development of collective industrial relations and changes in this field in 2001-2002 are evidence that in principle the needs of the market are met. On the other hand, however, it should be noteed that the availability of social partners is not sufficient to enlarge the number and scope of collective agreements to a significant extent. The development of collective bargaining only began during the years 1991-1992. A majority of employers do not see any benefits from collective bargaining (even, on the contrary, seeing it as a limitation in business freedom) and avoid entering into such 183 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania ",
        "agreements or tend to delay negotiations. Due to lack of interim co-operation and experience in collective bargaining, employees are not active enough in the signing of collective agreements either. Therefore, once the new Labour Code is put in force, it is very important to develop targeted information and training of different groups of employees on the one hand, while improving regulations promoting collective industrial relations on the other. Possibilities for social dialogue to support the EMU convergence process Analysis of the social situation and social dialogue has demonstrated that Lithuania has the right conditions to favour the co-operation of social partners. The new Labour Code and liberalisation of industrial relations creates opportunities for a more flexible regulation of industrial relations and maximal tuning up of employers and employees\u2019 interests. Yet, an analysis of the economic situation shows that social dialogue has not on the other been sufficiently used for this purpose in Lithuania. Table 1 Change in the main economic and labour market indices in Lithuania in 1999-2002 (as compared to the previous year, %) Indices 1999-1998 2000-1999 2001-2000 2002-2001 Increased of GDP -3.9 3.8 5.9 5.9 Increase of National Budget Tax Revenue -4.1 0.9 10.9 Employment changes -0.5 -3.7 -14.8 4.0 Average gross earnings 6.2 -1.7 1.0 5.3 According to the authors, data in Table 1 leads to the conclusion that in Lithuania there exists a relatively big gap (2 years) between the economic growth of the country and the manifestation of such growth in the social and employment sphere, which in fact does not match the aims of social dialogue in an EMU perspective. We find the GDP growth in 2000 and 2001 not only non- motivating with regard to employment growth, but even reducing it. Also, wages and salaries in the same period of time have not actually increased either. In future, social dialogue should limit such disharmonious economic development. The authors believe it is reasonable to set forth in the national-level agreement a link between changes in the GDP and average gross earnings. Moreover, taking into consideration an extremely low living standard in the country, particular attention by the social partners should be paid to the topic of labour costs. In the development of social dialogue at company and sector level, attention should be focused on reducing the phenomenons of double bookkeeping and informal employment. According to the Department of Statistics, the non-registered economy accounts for about 15% of GDP in Lithuania. Non-registered economic activities could best be controlled from \u2018inside\u2019 and collective bargaining is one of the mechanisms of the mentioned control. Non-registered industries cut down public budget revenues. Non-registered employment contributes to reducing social guarantees of the employed. On the other hand, however, it should be noted that a number of employers (and small ones in particular) find transparent economic activities to be profit-reducing and non-motivating investments. Therefore, in the EMU perspective, the development of social dialogue must be effectively harmonised with governmental tax policy in order to improve social development and production levels. To achieve this objective, economic measures promoted by social dialogue should be given particular attention. 184 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Conclusion Political situation Lithuania has already seen four Seimas (Parliament) terms of office since 1990 \u2013 the year of reclaiming independence. This period experienced continuous fluctuations in political forces in power \u2013 leftists in power were substituted by the rightists and vice versa. Currently the social democrats and social liberals form a majority in power in the Seimas. This majority has also formed the current Lithuanian government. However, irrespective of fluctuations of political forces, all main political parties in Lithuania agree regarding the priority perspectives of the development in Lithuania. This agreement was confirmed by the National Agreement signed by political parties and public organisations in Lithuania on 3 December 2002 with the goal of achieving economic and social progress. Economic situation On the whole, economic growth in the country started in 1995 with the increase in the GDP (exceptional drop in 1999). During the past two years, annual GDP growth was 5.9%. Growth of GDP in 2002 was related to increased domestic consumption and the development of almost all sectors of economy. Due to strict fiscal and monetary policy pursued in Lithuania from 1995 as well as due to rather limited effective demand of domestic market in the country, the level of inflation has considerably decreased (from 35% in 1995 to -1% in 2002 \u2013 the first annual deflation within 12 years of independence). Lithuania envisages meeting all the requirements set by the European Union for the amount of national budget deficit to the candidate countries. According to the preliminary estimate, the national budget deficit comprised 2.11% of the GDP in 2002. Lithuania also envisages meeting all the requirements set by the European Union in the field of budgetary regime providing for the amount of national debt for the candidate countries. On 31 December 2002, the national debt amounted to 13,162.8 million Litas or 26% of the forecasted GDP. In preparation for accession to the EU, Lithuania intends to maintain the fixed exchange rate. In order to promote further integration into the EU market, the anchor currency was changed from the US dollar to euro on 2 February 2002. The system of Litas exchange rate fixed to the euro will create the conditions for participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism-2 following Lithuania\u2019s accession to the EU and the introduction of the euro in future. Currently, the exchange rate of 1 EUR is 3.452 Litas. Regardless of positive macro-economic indicators in the country, Lithuania is still experiencing high unemployment rates and relatively low levels of wages and salaries as well as social benefits. The number of employed persons in the Lithuanian economy began to decrease since 1998 \u2013 the year of economic crisis in the country. The employment rate in 2002 was 49.9%. The unemployment rate in Lithuania has exceeded 10% margin since December 1999. Currently the unemployment rate is about 12% according to National Labour Exchange data and about 14% according to Labour Force Survey data. There is a high regional unemployment rate differentiation in the country. 185 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania ",
        "In 2002 the average monthly gross earnings amounted to 1034 Litas (300 EUR), net earnings \u2013 to 741 Litas (215 EUR), the minimum monthly wage amounted to 430 Lt ( 125 EUR) in Lithuania. The minimum monthly wage was not increased since 1998, the nominal average monthly gross wage during 1998-2002 year period increased by 11.1%. In 2002, the average monthly disposable (net) income per capita amounted to 421 Lt (122 EUR); the average monthly retirement pension to 324 Lt (94 EUR); the average monthly unemployment benefit to 172 Lt (50 EUR); the state supported income to 135 Lt (39 EUR). Social dialogue Since 1990, after the restoration of independence, a lot of work has been done to develop a dialogue between the social partners and to smooth the contradictions between capital and labour. On the whole, the legal regulation system for industrial relations has been established anew; and it is under constant development. By the end of 1991, new main laws regulating industrial relations were approved: the Law on Employment, Law on Individual Income Security, Law on Collective Bargaining, Law on Trade Unions, Law on Employment Contract and Law on Holidays. Almost all laws and their amendments in this sector were worked out together with the representatives of Trade Unions and Employers\u2019 Organisations. In developing industrial relations in Lithuania, greater possibilities have been provided for a direct dialogue between employees and employers. At present, there are two main employers\u2019 organisations in Lithuania: the Confederation of Lithuanian Industrialists and the Confederation of Lithuanian Entrepreneurs and Employers. There are also three main trade unions: the Confederation of Lithuanian Trade Unions, Lithuanian Labour Federation and Lithuanian Trade Union \u2018Solidarumas\u2019/Solidarity. A system of tripartite organisations in Lithuania is comprised of a number of tripartite councils and commissions, most of them specialised. Most of these organisations are operating at a national level, while some of them have extended their activities to regional level. The Tripartite Council of Vilnius City was established in 2000, followed by the Tripartite Council of Vilnius County, which was the first county-level council established in 2001. In addition to the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania, there are eight tripartite Commissions/Councils operating at national level. The creation of regional tripartite councils has only recently started. Yet, decision-making (likely to have impact on EMU) could be in fact influenced by the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania only. In 2002, the specialists at the Headquarters of the ILO in Budapest conducted an assessment of tripartite consultation mechanisms in Lithuania. Their conclusions provide a positive evaluation of tripartite consultation system in Lithuania, particularly of the Tripartite Council and the National Safety Commission. However, the conclusions point out the insufficient emphasis on the influence of separate tripartite institutions upon making final decisions, not always clearly defined functions and rights of separate tripartite institutions, as well as insufficient co-operation between tripartite institutions. 186 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Labour Code and collective agreements In June 2002, the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania passed a new Labour Code that came into force on 1 January 2003. The new Labour Code is based on main legal acts of the European Union and the ILO and provisions of European Social Charter. The Labour Code pays particular attention to the development of social dialogue and collective industrial relations: the conception of social partnership and principles of collaboration are defined for the first time. However, the level of activity around the signing of collective agreements is still insufficient in Lithuania. Collective agreements so far are basically concluded at enterprise level only. Only about 15% of enterprises and organisations have concluded collective agreements. Sectoral collective agreements were concluded only in a few sectors (energy, communications and education) and are more of a declarative nature. According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, for the year 2001 there were 34 strikes in the country, including 29 warning strikes. Compared to 2000, the number of strikes in 2001 was fewer (56 strikes in 2000), while in 2002 not a single strike was registered. In order to consolidate social partnership and regulation of industrial relations through collective agreements, the Lithuanian government according to the Tripartite Council recommendations confirmed the \u2018Government, Trade Unions and Employers\u2019 Organisations measures of Social Partnership Development Plan for 2003-2004\u2019 in January 2003. Possibilities for social dialogue to support the EMU convergence process Analysis of the social situation and social dialogue demonstrated that Lithuania has favourable conditions for co-operation of social partners. The new Labour Code and liberalisation of industrial relations create opportunities for more flexible regulation of industrial relations and maximal tuning up of employers and employees\u2019 interests. However the analysis of the economic situation shows that social dialogue has not been sufficiently used for this purpose in Lithuania so far.

        "As is mentioned in the report, the political situation in Lithuania as well as the regulation of industrial relations facilitates all the necessary conditions for the development of social dialogue. But in reality cooperation between employers and employees has not reached the desireable level of effectiveness yet, although it is assuming growing importance. The new Labour Code should be oriented to the regulation of work relations under collective agreements. Social partners in Lithuania must seek to attain the same level of importance for social dialogue as it has in other candidate countries: they must act together to transpose the statutory regulations into realistic industrial relations at national and regional (local) levels. Thus in developing a social dialogue in Lithuania, we should first of all answer six questions (based on the six-level principle: \u2018WHAT? WHY? WHEN? WHERE? WHO? WHICH?\u2019 ): 1. WHAT should be done? Promote social partners\u2019 interest in developing collective industrial relations It is important to promote the development of social dialogue, using economic rather than administrative measures. The social dialogue tradition started in Lithuania in 1990 and it should be emphasised that significant progress has been made (especially after the year 2000). The new Labour Code promotes collective agreements as well. The aim is to create a favourable environment for the promotion of collective agreements and increase reliance on the social partners. Develop a wages regulatory system through linking economic growth and social development As the report highlighted, economic growth in Lithuania is not in step with the social development of the country. Social dialogue should facilitate the preparation of an effective wages growth model, as well securing the link between economic and social development. It is necessary to ensure that economic growth serves the interests of all sections of society, not just a small group of citizens. On the other hand, the growth of wages should depend not only on subjective factors (relations between employer and employee), but also on objective factors, such as the results of production and general macroeconomic situation. 2. WHY should it be done? Low standard of living Increased income gap between different social groups and growing social exclusion Social stratification is widely proliferating in Lithuania. Insufficient income level regulations as well as limited possibilities for social support increase the number of poor families, especially in rural areas. The annual increase in average wages as well as in minimum monthly wage is insufficient. Tax policy not oriented towards employment The number of employed disabled and elderly people went down significantly in 1998-2003 in Lithuania. The current tax policy does not encourage employers to take on young people and students for work experience. There are no measures to support the first work placement of these persons. Taxation of the labour force in Lithuania is one of the highest in Europe (a burden on both employers and employees), therefore social partners should put pressure on the government to change the tax policy. Annex National Action Plan Guidelines 189 ",
        "3. WHEN is it appropriate to carry it out? The main idea is \u2018step by step\u2019: Prepare strongly motivated programme documents to be adopted by the social partners (end of 2003 \u2013 beginning of 2004) Carry out joint social partner research and surveys for possible development (2004-2006 and later) Work towards drafting and adoption of legislation (2004-2005) Organise systematic training of the social partners The social partners\u2019 organisations in Lithuania are not sufficiently solid , especially in the regions, where the development of industrial infrastructure is not very high. Therefore, targeted training could be one of the most effective instruments in developing and strengthening social dialogue. 4. WHERE is it appropriate to carry it out? The Tripartite Commission of Wages under the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania Historically, wages is one of the major targets of social dialogue. Therefore, it would be useful to pay particular attention to the regulation of this industrial relations element. If circumstances of wages alteration could be harmonised (to conclude an agreement on the general wages system in sectors), it would be a reason for us to say that social partners\u2019 cooperation is moving to a higher stage and has a relevant role to play. 5. WHO should be responsible for this work? Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania It should be mentioned that in 2000-2003 the role of the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania has grown considerably. Therefore, we can expect that the role of this institution will be as important in the future and enable us to increase influence on governmental decisions. The other alternative is the Ministry of Social Security and Labour. However, given that the Ministry of Social Security and Labour is one of the social partners, the delegation of all the responsibilities to this institution would be inefficient as well as distort the principle of social cooperation. In view of current circumstances, the specialists of the Ministry of Social Security and Labour should encourage and initiate the development of social dialogue and collective agreements in Lithuania. 6. WHICH resources should we use for our work? Financial resources: European Foundation for the ILWC, International Labour Organisation, EU Funds, National Budget (budgets of municipalities), Lithuanian Employment Fund, financial resources of social partners It should be stressed that the development of social partnership does not have sufficient support from financial resources at national level. Therefore, on the one hand we should cooperate more actively with foreign partners and international organisations and on the other seek to increase national resources. Human resources: working groups of the representatives of social partners and academic society It is vital to empower integrated groups of social partners\u2019 delegates and scientific officers when organising and putting forward particular proposals. This would enable us to increase work efficiency as well as simplify the procedure of coming to an agreement on drafted proposals. Furthermore, these integrated groups would be more flexible and proposals would correspond 190 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "more to the interests of the social partners. It is important to mention the necessity of further development of the relationship between social partners and the academic world. As social partners do not yet have any particular research centres, the proposals do not always have a sufficiently theoretical and analytical validation, which sometimes results in undesirable consequences in terms of untenable decisions. 191 Social dialogue and EMU in Lithuania ",

        "Edward Zammit, University of Malta Among all the candidate countries for EU membership, Malta is by far the smallest. 1 Partly for this reason, once the institutional adjustments to accommodate a much-enlarged Union are in place, Malta\u2019s membership is not generally perceived as causing any major problems for the Union. 2 From the local perspective, however, this issue now dominates the national political, social and economic debate. In this politically polarised society the leaders of the two main parties \u2013 the Nationalist Party which is currently in government, and the Labour Party in opposition \u2013 frequently accuse each other: of being \u2018obsessed\u2019 with getting Malta into or with keeping Malta out of the EU. Public opinion polls are often cited showing a tiny majority swinging one way or the other with a significant minority of the sample investigated being \u2018undecided.\u2019 The EU debate, in Malta, is a highly divisive issue, as both main parties are rallying the support of their traditional followers, allies and like-minded associations, including the trade unions. This paper is based on the assumption of membership which, in Malta\u2019s present context, cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, as membership negotiations are still in progress, the economic conditions and their full impact on industrial relations are still undetermined. Political situation Since independence was obtained from Britain in 1964, Malta has been a stable democratic state. The two main political parties, the Nationalist Party, which is currently in government, and the Labour Party, which is currently in opposition, have roughly the same following and, from time to time, have alternated power. There is a high political participation with more than 90% of registered electors voting in elections. While the two main parties largely represent persons with different social backgrounds, the existing class differences are not insurmountable. There has been significant social mobility particularly since the 1960s and a generous welfare state has been established with frequent improvements since the 1970s. As a result, most people have acquired a strong belief in social progress and in political efficacy. Simultaneously, there is a strong adherence to tradition, as evidenced by the considerable influence still wielded by the Church and the participation of the faithful in religious rituals. Sociological studies have shown that political patronage and paternalism are still widely practised, reflecting the proximity and personal linkages between electors and their representatives in a small scale, closely knit society. There are also many traces of a persisting colonial mentality. The latter includes the political division of the island between the two main parties and their supporters, which sometimes borders on tribalism. The party in government is committed by its electoral manifesto to take Malta into the EU as a matter of priority. For its part, the party in opposition is conducting an equally intensive campaign to convince the electorate that EU membership is not in Malta\u2019s best interest. Nonetheless, on the strength of its handsome parliamentary majority, the government is actively implementing its electoral programme. Significantly, this includes the process of adjustment of Malta\u2019s legislation Social dialogue and EMU in Malta 7 193 1 Malta\u2019s size is 315.6 square kilometers and it is situated 93 kilometers south of Sicily. Its population is 380,000. 2 EU survey (as reported by Dr G. Boggio, Head of the EU Delegation to Malta, at the opening of the conference on \u201cChallenges of Change\u201d organised by the European Documentation and Research Centre of the University of Malta \u2013 April 2000). ",
        "and its institutions to the requirements of the Acquis Communautaire , despite the Labour Party\u2019s opposition. Economic situation According to commonly used international criteria, Malta may be classified among developed, industrialised country. The Maltese enjoy a living standard which compares favourably with that of its neighbouring countries. Since attaining its independence in 1964, Malta has undergone an uninterrupted process of economic and social development. Considering that this is a small, overpopulated island with very limited natural resources, this development may largely be attributed to the resourcefulness of its people and the efficacy of its leaders. Nevertheless, the general sense of well-being which prevails may also be misleading and hides Malta\u2019s economic vulnerability. Following Malta\u2019s original application for EU membership in 1993, the Commission expressed the opinion that the country\u2019s successful integration within the EU would require \u2018a root-and-branch overhaul of the entire regulatory and operational framework of the Maltese economy\u2026 and to undertake vigorously the required reforms to transform Malta\u2019s economy into an open and competitive one\u2019. It is argued that while significant progress towards reaching this aim has been achieved during the past nine years, there is still considerable ground to be covered especially if the aim is to fulfil the EMU criteria within two years after eventual membership. Between the years 1996 and 2000, the growth rate of GDP has been calculated at 4.3% per annum to reach a real GDP per capita of Lm3724.6 (9311 Euro). For the period 2001\u20132004, however, lower growth rates are expected. According to Malta\u2019s Central Bank, in 2001, \u2018the progressive deterioration in global economic conditions took its toll on the Maltese economy\u2019. This economic slow-down has further accelerated following the tragic events of September 11 th . Nominal GDP growth in 2001 amounted to 3.9% which translates into a negative one per cent when corrected for inflation. Currently it is claimed by some that they perceive the signs of an economic improvement. 3 Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that many challenges lie ahead. Malta\u2019s GDP per capita at 11,900 euro, is only 53.2% of the EU average according to the purchasing power standard (PPS). On the basis of the economic growth rate achieved by Malta in the years before 2001, it is estimated to take another 30 years in order to reach 75% of the current EU average level. Clearly an urgent remedial strategy is required not merely to reduce this unacceptably long period for reaching EU standards, but even for ensuring that the past rates of economic growth will be maintained in future. Hence, meeting these challenges is a necessity \u2013 irrespective of whether Malta\u2019s EU membership bid is realised or not. Once Malta joins the EU, these challenges would also become part of the EMU requirement. According to a recent report published by the EU Commission on macro-economic conditions in candidate countries, it is stated that: \u2018Malta\u2019s macroeconomic challenges stem primarily from the maintenance of its external competitiveness and the reduction of the government deficit to sustainable levels. \u2026It will be fundamental to maintain wage growth moderation and to continue 194 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 3 Lawrence Zammit: \u2018How many swallows make a spring?\u2019 The Times (Business & Finance), May 10th, 2002. ",
        "with structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of the Maltese economy. At the same time, fiscal policy needs to progress towards further consolidation\u2026\u2019. Some of the main, specific challenges confronting Malta\u2019s economy are listed below. Reducing the public deficit One main challenge for the country is the reduction of the deficit in government finance from the unacceptable level of 12% in 1998 to around 4% of GDP. \u2013 as required by the EMU criteria. An increase in revenue is being achieved through the selling out of state assets and an imposition of higher taxation rates. Particular efforts are being made by government \u2013 following the insistence of trade unions \u2013 to control income tax evasion. On the other hand, it is proving difficult for government to reduce its expenditure. It should be noted that during 2001, the payment of salaries to government employees amounted to 32.9% of the recurrent expenditure while the total expenditure on social policy \u2013 including welfare benefits, education and health amounted to 60%. As expected, any attempts at reducing the established welfare benefits and threaten to reduce the people\u2019s living standards are bound to meet with a strong resistance from the unions. Despite a number of setbacks, it is claimed that, as a result of the fiscal measures taken by government since 1998, the deficit had been reduced by 36% smaller by 2001 and the aim remains to reduce it to a level below 4% by 2004. 4 Much, however, remains to be done in order to narrow the \u2018welfare gap\u2019, and establish a fairer and more efficient tax collection system. Controlling the surge in public debt From LM516.8m in 1996, public debt has reached LM1049m in 2002 and to these must be added a further LM414.8m of Government guaranteed loans to state owned entities - amounting to approximately 60% of GDP. This worrying situation is, however, tempered by the fact that only 3.7% of this amount is owed to foreign sources while the rest is owed to local sources. Keeping inflation under control Recently the inflation rate has tended to fluctuate on a two year cycle. Between 1988 and 1995 the average inflation rate was 3.98%. This went down to 2.33% between 1998 and September 2001. During the first quarter of 2002 it again reached 3.62% but likely to go down at year\u2019s end. Maintaining a steady, low inflation rate is an important condition for economic and social development. Reducing the public sector role The dismantling of an oversized public sector \u2013 both in terms of employment and economic activity \u2013 is another major challenge facing the Government in its EU \u2018fitness programme\u2019. This challenge is being met partly through a privatisation programme. The process, however, has tended to be slow and uncertain both due to technical problems at a time of international recession and to trade union opposition. Bringing the informal and \u2018black\u2019 economy into the mainstream This sector may be described as significant even if only on the basis of observations and rough estimates. It includes activities in agriculture, construction, tourism, repairs and maintenance, and 195 Social dialogue and EMU in Malta 4 These claims are strongly denied by spokesmen of the opposition Labour Party. See, for instance: Leo Brincat, \u2018The State We\u2019re In\u2019 in The (Malta) Times , October 5, 2002, p. 8-10. ",
        "related trades. Regulating such activities is not only necessary for fiscal purposes but also for the establishment of quality assurance, vocational training and working conditions, including occupational health and safety standards. Industrial and economic restructuring This is required in order to increase the international competitiveness of industry and of the economy as a whole. It also involves co-ordinating the efforts of SME\u2019s, particularly those affected by the removal of protective levies . The value of manufactured exports in 2001 was 18.6% less than the previous year and in January 2002 there was a further decline of 20%. Attracting foreign direct investment Malta\u2019s attractiveness for FDI has been reduced during the last decade. This followed the opening up of competition from Eastern European states which possess the advantages of geographical proximity to the north European markets, more economies of scale, raw materials and, above all, lower wages and other production costs. In order to make a better concerted drive for the attraction of FDI and to increase competitiveness, the Malta Development Corporation, the Malta External Trade Corporation, the Malta Investments Corporation, and the Institute for the Promotion of Small Enterprises are being amalgamated into a single organisation called \u2018Malta Enterprise\u2019. A Business Promotion Act and an Industrial Policy Document have recently been adopted for the same purposes. Active labour market policies The \u2018Joint Assessment of the Employment Policy Priorities\u2019 carried out by the Maltese Government and the EU Commission in October 2001, has identified the main areas where action is urgently required in terms of the EU Employment Strategy. The progress achieved in pursuing these objectives is assessed in the annual progress reports which are also carried out jointly. Furthermore it is expected that some tangible assistance in realising these objectives will become available through the European Social Fund. The requirements are also being incorporated in the National Development Plan. One overall goal is to increase the employment rate which, at 54.6%, is 8.7% lower than the EU average. The participation of women, at 33.1% is 20.9% lower than the EU average. Achieving a balance between labour supply and demand The main priorities include: adopting a national human resources development strategy; the upgrading of vocational education and training; systematic efforts to raise skill levels; an emphasis on multi-skills; flexibility, and global quality standards; new efforts to reduce illiteracy. The active involvement of the social partners is necessary for the effective pursuit of these aims. Environmental and waste disposal management Short of effective, urgent action in this regard, all other socio-economic development will be jeopardised. Upgrading tourism services Constant increases in the number of visitors are unsustainable. Tourist arrivals dropped by 2.9% in 2001, resulting in a loss of 2.8% in earnings from tourism and a further drop is predicted for 2002. It is necessary to aim at quality rather than mass tourism and to pay more attention to client satisfaction. 196 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Reforming the tax and social benefits system The aim is to reduce poverty traps while providing the right incentives for people to take up work. The problem of a widening welfare gap must be addressed. Furthermore the national insurance scheme must be revised in order to safeguard its viability. Labour market At the end of 2001, the total workforce consisted of 155,751 persons. This constituted an employment rate of 54.2% which is low by EU standards. The main occupational categories for full-time workers are listed below. Occupational Categories Males 70.8% Females 29.2% Private Sector 66.7% Public Sector 33.3% Manufacturing 20.2% Market services* 36.8% Other Services 26.7% Construction 7.7% Agriculture & Fisheries 2.1% Registered Unemployed 6.5% * Excluding utilities Source: National Statistics Office: Labour Force Survey \u2013 December 2001 The main sectors of the Labour market with the contribution of each sector to GDP are listed below: (cid:2) The share of agriculture and fisheries both in GDP and in terms of occupation is very small: 2.5% and 1.8% respectively. (cid:2) The share of construction and quarrying accounts for 2.7% of GDP and 3.8% of employment. (cid:2) Manufacturing industry as a whole contributes 22.3% of GDP and 21.9% of total employment (excluding ship repair and shipbuilding). Malta\u2019s manufacturing sector falls into two categories. On the one hand there is an internationally competitive, export-oriented category. These enterprises are often the local subsidiaries of multinational companies, attracted to Malta over the years by a package of state sponsored incentives. On the other hand, there is also \u2018a relatively uncompetitive, inefficient and protected category producing mainly for the local market\u2019. It has been pointed out that \u2018significant restructuring must take place in some of these enterprises before EU accession in order to adjust to increased competition\u2019. 5 It should be also noted that 50% of the protective levies have already been removed in the last two years and the remaining 50% will be removed in January, 2003. Furthermore, the Maltese workers 197 Social dialogue and EMU in Malta 5 Report on Updating the Commission\u2019s Opinion on Malta\u2019s Application for membership, 1999. ",
        "and their representatives are not generally prepared to accept unilaterally a lowering of their own working conditions in order to secure the competitiveness of industry. The new Employment and Industrial Relations Bill, which is currently being debated in parliament, has been criticised by the employers\u2019 representative bodies on this score. The \u2018local\u2019 manufacturing sector includes the following industries: 6 (cid:2) Food manufacturing with 2.3% of the gainfully occupied. (cid:2) Furniture and fixtures with 1.8% of the gainfully occupied. (cid:2) Transport equipment with 2.2% of the gainfully occupied. The total number of employees in the above sectors has been declining in recent years and currently amounts to approximately 9148 persons. The decline is not due to any fall in consumption. It rather reflects the sector\u2019s inability to compete internationally, due to the creation of more capital intensive firms, cheaper labour, economies of scale and the use of more efficient technology in competitor countries. Another important sector, which has been highly debated over the years, is that of ship-repair and ship-building. The two state owned enterprises of this sector collectively employed 3500 workers in 2001 (2.5% of the entire workforce). They require an annual state subsidy of around Lm10m. (25m Euro). The industry has been making heavy losses for the last twenty years despite the many efforts made throughout this period to make it viable. These included a steady reduction of the workforce, mainly through natural attrition. An early retirement scheme, with generous terminal benefits offered by government, has recently attracted the voluntary resignations of 700 employees from Malta Drydocks. The economic shift towards the services sector, which is rapidly taking place in the highly industrialised countries, is also visible in Malta. The various services sectors are the following: (cid:2) The wholesale and retail sector has been marginally affected by trade liberalisation - as required both by the EU and Malta\u2019s membership of the World Trade Organisation. These included measures such as the removal of importation levies. The contribution to G.D.P. by this sector has gone down from 14.29% in 1992 to 11.07% in 2001. Employment in this sector amounts to 11.1%. (cid:2) The sector of insurance, banking and real estate has been experiencing advances in both employment income and profitability levels. This sector contributes 7.9% to G.D.P. and 4% of total employment. (cid:2) The community and business sector includes the self-employed professionals and all the persons employed in organisations offering services to the community. Over the last years there was a consistent increase in employment within this sector, currently reaching 10% of the total workforce. These include an increasing number of university graduates. 198 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 6 Until recently, the footwear and clothing industries were included in this category, with 2.6% of the gainfully occupied. Most enterprises left are local subsidiaries of international companies which are export oriented. Their problem is that of maintaining international competitiveness. ",
        "Apart from the traditional professions, the popular occupations among young graduates includes those in marketing, I.C.T., communications, media, social work, business management, accounting and financial services. Although in recent years employment in the public sector in Malta has been gradually decreasing, it is still excessively large, with 33.3% of the total workforce. Of these, the majority (22.1% of total) are engaged in public administration. These contribute 15.1% of G.D.P. The rest are mainly engaged in publicly owned companies and independent statutory bodies including the public corporations providing water and electricity. Finally there are the services related to Hotels, Catering and Recreation in connection with the Tourist Industry. This is an expanding sector and currently accounts for 9.6% of the total workforce and around 11.7% of GDP. Industrial relations Background The social basis for Malta\u2019s industrial relations system was established during the period of the British colonial administration 7 . The pioneering role played by Britain in industrialisation - with its worldwide trade and defense commitments \u2013 assimilated Malta within the imperial network and turned it into an important Mediterranean outpost for the execution of its global strategy. As a result, Malta became exposed to a wide range of industrial attitudes and experiences at an early stage when compared with other neighbouring countries. These attitudes included a liberal- pluralist political ideology and a perception of private enterprise as the main motor for industrial development. Concomitantly, the Maltese workers acquired aspirations for a regulatory framework of industrial relations \u2013 including the establishment and recognition of free trade unions, the establishment of employer organisations, and a legal framework for the protection of employment and the settlement of industrial disputes. Nowadays, after almost four decades of independence, the influence of British institutions is still evident in many areas of social, political and economic life. This is particularly the case in industrial relations policy, which continues to be modelled on that of Britain within a European context. As a result, the established model of industrial relations in Malta is that of voluntary, bi- partite, collective bargaining at the enterprise level in a traditionally polarised relationship between employers and trade unions. Additionally, in recent decades, there has been a parallel development of corporate, tri-partite, bargaining at the national level based on a social partnership model. This pattern is emerging in response to shifts in the balance of economic power as well as in response to economic exigencies such as the need to retain jobs and to attract foreign investment in a competitive, international environment, which is limiting the range of collective bargaining Social dialogue The institutions comprising the tripartite framework of labour relations are firmly established in Malta. Through their roles in collective bargaining at both the national and the enterprise levels, the social partners \u2013 both individually and collectively \u2013 play a vital part in determining national social and economic development. This is partly due to established tradition and even more to the 199 Social dialogue and EMU in Malta 7 Malta formed part of the British Empire between 1800 - 1964. ",
        "relative power of the social partners in the economic, social and political spheres. Even more than legislation, the chief means by which labour standards are established is through collective bargaining. In 1990, the Malta Council for Economic Development (MCED), a tripartite body was set up by government in agreement with and the participation of all the \u2018social partners\u2019 . One main aim of this Council, soon after its establishment, was to draft a national incomes policy, which was seen as an important means towards attaining industrial peace and economic growth. An initial agreement for three years was reached but this was not officially renewed when it expired as the various parties, wanted to introduce important changes to it. In particular the General Workers\u2019 Union, mounted a campaign against the increasing taxation levels and cost of living which, it argued, was not being adequately compensated through the statutory wage increases granted under the National Agreement. As a result, a tripartite board was established to oversee and determine the retail price index. On the union side, the United Workers\u2019 Union (UHM) embarked on a campaign against what it regarded as the \u2018anti-social\u2019 increases in water and electricity rates that were introduced in 1998. It also argued that the government should introduce tighter controls against tax evasion. For their part, the employers argued against the practice of statutory, across the board, cost of living increases which, they believed, should instead be negotiated through collective bargaining. Under these circumstances, discussions within MCED were leading nowhere and a common complaint was that the Council was \u2018merely a talking shop\u2019. While all the parties agreed on the need to retain the Council, they were demanding action by government to remedy the situation. This demand was reinforced by the EU Commission\u2019s emphasis on social dialogue as an integral part of its employment strategy. In 2001, following a series of consultations, government introduced a new Act institutionalising the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (henceforth: MCESD). The newly shaped Council now incorporates, as a separate but related organ, a forum for civic society, which includes: \u2018 those organisations established to seek the common good and whose main aims are neither to generate profits nor to seek executive power.\u2019 The idea is to widen both the representation and the range of issues falling under the Council\u2019s jurisdiction. The Council is currently still in a process of adjustment to its new role. It is still building its own research and administrative infrastructure in order to be able to carry out its functions properly. Its resources, though still very limited, have increased substantially. One interesting development during the last two years has been the readiness of the social partners to enter into serious discussions with government in preparation of its annual budget. The declared Government\u2019s policy is to seek consensus among all the partners rather than to impose its will through legislation. Nevertheless, this policy is being put to a severe test mainly due to the higher taxation and other unpopular measures which Government is constrained to implement in order to reduce its fiscal deficit and bring it in line with the EU standards. In the meantime, it is becoming increasingly clear that a positive disposition on the part of the social partners is not by itself sufficient for the practice of EU social dialogue to function effectively. What is also required is a 200 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "process of learning of the new roles and expectations both on the parts of the main actors and of their constituents. Conclusion: Towards a National Development Plan Meeting the economic challenges, which the country currently faces, is likely to cause a significant upheaval in the labour market and in employment practices. It is argued that such an upheaval is inevitable if the country is to meet the challenges of globalisation, new technology, the WTO, and particularly, the EMU criteria to which Malta is committed. The repercussions of this upheaval are also likely to have an impact on the social and political spheres. The urgency with which the necessary adjustments are being implemented by government and the accompanying social upheavals are perceived by some as possibly outweighing the remote and uncertain advantages of EU membership. As a result, there is certain wariness among many Maltese workers and their leaders about EU membership. To these, must be added the preoccupations about the loss of sovereignty and national identity, and the uncertainty surrounding Malta\u2019s neutral status which is firmly embedded in the Constitution. Under these circumstances, it appears that the only way through which viable solutions to the existing challenges may be sought is through a renewed, positive commitment to social dialogue among all three social partners. Despite all declarations to the contrary, such a commitment has hitherto proved elusive. To sum up the following main points are highlighted: (cid:2) The recent establishment of the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development has provided the necessary legal and institutional basis for the development of social dialogue. Nonetheless, the system is still encountering some serious problems - particularly the harmonisation of the formal and the informal levels of interaction among the social partners. This problem has its roots deeply embedded in Maltese culture and reflects the traditional \u2018colonial\u2019 mentality. (cid:2) The social partners have a critical role to play. It is necessary to clarify the exact role of each partner \u2013 including the role of government. In order to perform this role, they need to build trust in each other. A basic, legitimate question is whether all the social partners have the necessary will to seek national solutions to national issues. This partly depends on their ability to avoid getting detached from their constituents. To succeed in this task, they need to design a developmental process and to follow an agreed plan of action. (cid:2) The development of an effective national social dialogue institution in Malta is a necessary condition towards finding viable, widely acceptable solutions to the socio-economic and political challenges confronting the country. In order to meet the EMU deadlines, the institution of social dialogue has to function effectively. (cid:2) Once the necessary, basic structure has been established, an effort must be made to ensure that the social dialogue institution functions effectively, on the experience of the best practices in other EU member states. This involves the assignment of formal responsibility to an agency for the development of a social dialogue culture. The aim would be to constantly monitor and guide the process on the basis of independent, action research and focused educational programmes. 201 Social dialogue and EMU in Malta ",

        "Wieslawa Kozek, Institute of Sociology, Warsaw University Poland continuously pursues policies aimed at fighting inflation and limiting the budget deficit. Such a policy did of course give rise to social protests in the past and its main advocate, Leszek Balcerowicz, is disliked by the trade unions. However, certain goals have been reached and this has brought the Polish economy closer to achieving the so-called Maastricht economic convergence criteria. It must be noted, though, that Poland is a country of turbulent transformations, hence it is difficult to predict what will be the effects of governmental decisions, and especially what will be their consequences, viewed over time. Entry into the economic and monetary area of the European Union appears to constitute an opportunity to find a stable reference point for the changes taking place. Specialists and politicians are holding discussions whether it would not actually pay for us to unilaterally introduce the euro as the only legal means of payment in the country 1 . Technically this would be secured by the large Polish international reserves (26 bln USD) but such a move bears all the signs of a shock therapy, something the Polish society has actually endured but, like all shock therapies, it is not liked. It is also probable that society would no longer put up with further shock therapies. Continuation of any shock therapy whatsoever in Poland will meet with even greater dissatisfaction and will result in the victory of such social groups in Poland in the next parliamentary elections that draw upon radical populist rhetoric. The sum of shock therapies applied in Poland since the beginning of the 1990s is at the moment creating a critical mass that is not balanced by a similar critical mass of positive changes in the economy, meaning a better economic condition of households. Poland has not achieved all Maastricht economic convergence criteria to date but it is important that the efforts are continuous and there are already certain successes that can be noted in this area. This paper presents a few data from recent years relating to these criteria, as well as certain government plans.

In reality, the Polish Government agrees to budget deficit increases in response to social pressure, mainly coming from the public sector but also in order to support economic growth (e.g., infrastructure expenditures). The discussions held in recent years also point out that previous governments have been unable to stop the outflow of public funds into relevant agencies that spent them in irrational ways and facilitated the take-over of part of their assets by private companies. Political situation The political situation seems to be stabilised, and in this sense, the government that was formed after the parliamentary elections of 2001 is founded on a clear majority and \u2013 judging from the experience of the previous parliamentary term \u2013 may last for a long time, even with a minority formula and even with considerable social dissatisfaction. Table 2 Political parties and their seats in the Polish Parliament (15 August 2002) Political parties Seats in Parliament Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) 198 Citizens\u2019 Platform 57 Self-Defence 49 Law and Justice 43 Polish Peasant Party (PSL) 41 Polish Families League 37 Labour Union 16 Folk\u2013Conservative Party 8 Folk\u2013Democratic Party 3 Non-united 8 The government coalition is formed by the Democratic Left Alliance \u2013 a party that is based on social-democratic values that clearly benefited from the wave of dissatisfaction with the government of the Election Action \u2018Solidarity\u2019. This government coalition is formed together with the Polish Peasant Party, currently a small party strongly established in the rural environment and tailoring its policies to the rural electorate. The third party in the coalition is the Labour Union, a small party strongly oriented towards social-democratic values, articulating very matter-of-principle criticism in relation to the Democratic Left Alliance. The membership base of all these parties clearly favours increased redistribution of the state\u2019s policies, state interventionism in the economy and an increase in public spending to protect certain social groups that are experiencing particular problems, for example: farmers, workers of large enterprises, employees in regions that are threatened by the consequences of restructuring, the unemployed, pensioners, young families, etc. It is a government that advocates social democratic values but in practice this is not of huge significance. Almost all political groups in Poland, after coming into power, have to pursue a middle-of-the-road policy: continuing privatisation, strengthening institutional market mechanisms, introducing unpopular reforms of the public sector, supporting economic progress and preparing the country to meet European Union accession requirements. The balance of power between the so-called right and left side of the political scene appears to have been quite even in the long run. At the same time, however, as in other countries of the region, there are extreme political parties which criticise the current political system and the country\u2019s elite, for example 204 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "\u2018Samoobrona\u2019 (Self-Defence) and Polish Families League. These sit in Parliament and their leaders express their objections against Poland\u2019s entry into the European Union, call for wide state interventionism and blame politicians for robbing the fatherland. During a social unrest, it is possible that they could take over the public and political initiative. Industrial relations system The system of collective labour relations must be regarded as being the type based on a strong social and institutional foundation. Part of it is comprised of legal foundations of the work of independent trade unions, employer associations, strikes (but not lock-outs), and mediation and arbitration procedures, procedures for entering into collective labour agreements. This system is accompanied by a number of infrastructure institutions: Governmental agendas, labour courts, the state labour inspection, the trade union (social) labour inspection, state labour offices, numerous associations and foundations that support the struggle against unemployment. Trade unions Trade union membership is not just a fa\u00e7ade. It stems from the authentic needs of employees. Research suggests that 14% of the labour force belongs to trade unions, and this is evidence of a declining trend as compared to the beginning of the 1990s. 2 Trade unions estimate the union density to be at the level of 18%. A decline in trade union density is related to the privatisation of the economy: trade unions do not exist in the newly established private companies and in the public sector, trade union membership has decreased as a result of a decline in public sector employment. Trade unions are strong in large enterprises, while in the small and medium enterprise sector they are almost non-existent. Worker\u2019s councils, strong in the 1980s and 1990s, and active in the state enterprises, have disappeared together with privatisation. In 1997, among those declaring trade union membership, 47% mentioned the Independent \u2018Solidarity\u2019 trade union, 28.8% the All-Poland Trade Union Agreement (OPZZ) and 24.4% mentioned other trade unions 3 . It is the public sector that is the stronghold of trade unions \u2013 the state enterprises and companies of the state treasury. Politically, ideologically and organisationally, the trade union movement is divided into two parts. The \u2018Solidarity\u2019 trade union is a compact, centralised structure, currently with 900,000 members, organised in so-called regions and branch sectors. In its ideology, it refers to the Catholic social science. However, taking into account the historical roots of this trade union, its members usually represent an independent stand on many issues at the level of the workplace. The nation-wide (All- Poland) Trade Union Agreement (OPZZ), also with 900,000 members, is a federation structure, loose and difficult to manage centrally. A number of federations and national unions form part of the OPZZ and these structures are stronger than the territorial structures of the trade union. In its ideological beliefs, OPZZ presents itself as a left-wing trade union, but in practice, at the level of the workplace, it is rather a pragmatic union that favours cooperation with employers. Over the past few months, there has emerged a new initiative called Trade Union \u2018Forum\u2019 that aims at becoming a federation of those trade unions that do not belong to the existing nation-wide organisations. It is supposed to unite 18 sector trade union organisations: railway workers, nurses 205 Social dialogue and EMU in Poland 2 Report \u2018Czy Polacy chc \u00e0 euro?\u2019, CBOS, 17 czerwca 2002, www.cbos.org.pl. 3 Bogdan Cichomski, Pawel Morawski, \u2018The General Polish Social Survey.

        "and midwives, heating company employees, road workers, the police, drivers, postmen, anaesthetists, engineers and public transport workers. It is estimated that such a confederation would include 390,000 members. The founders of the Trade Union \u2018Forum\u2019 believe that the model of free competition capitalism has not worked in Polish conditions and the choice for the future is \u2018wise state interventionism\u2019. Employers Employers are organised in a number of ways and are organisationally dispersed. The oldest National Confederation of Polish Employers has among its members employers from the public sector, employers from state enterprises and from state treasury enterprises. This is the earliest registered employer association. The employers that form part of it present a strategy of reaching agreement with trade unions. The second national Polish Confederation of Private Employers has members mainly from the private sector and those who run small and medium-sized companies. It represents Polish employers inside European Union structures. Recently, the Union of Polish Crafts adopted partly the status of an employer, rather a strong structure of those who work for themselves. The Union of Polish Crafts is an association with a very long tradition, reaching back to the nineteenth century. The Business Centre Club Employers Association \u2013 an association of wealthy businessmen, club-type \u2013 is an association active in the field of public relations for business in Poland. The National Chamber of Commerce, a powerful structure that unites branch chambers, came forward with an initiative to be registered as an employer association by the appropriate court. Table 3 Social partners in the Polish industrial relations system Social partners Size / membership All-Poland Trade Union Agreement (OPZZ) 900,000 members \u2018Solidarity\u2019 trade union 900,000 members Trade Union Forum 390,000 members National Confederation of Polish Employers Employers for more than 300,000 employees Polish Confederation of Private Employers Employers for more than 300,000 employees Business Centre Club Employers Association Employers for more than 300,000 employees Union of Polish Crafts Employers for more than 300,000 employees Social dialogue The TriPartite Committee for Socio-Economic Matters, a state-level social dialogue institution that exists since 1994 has been legally strengthened by a Parliamentary Act. No less than 421 out of 430 members of Parliament voted it in. In proportion to the number of members, the Committee comprises of: \u2018Solidarity\u2019 trade union, All-Poland Trade Union Agreement, the Confederation of Polish Employers, the Polish Confederation of Private Employers, the Union of Polish Crafts and, recently, the Business Centre Club. The Business Centre Club and National Chamber of Commerce also aspire to the Tripartite Committee. The Minister of Labour chairs the committee. The Act states that similar tripartitite committees will be established at regional levels. The Tripartite Committee as a consultative body deals with economic policy, the labour market, social benefits and wages, social insurance and of course, also with the development of social dialogue and changes in the labour law. The first works of the Committee dealt with the Budget Act for 2002 and the so-called budget-related acts. 206 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Where there are trade unions, collective agreements are concluded. Since 1995, there were 11,000 such agreements concluded, of which 8,000 are in force today. A large proportion of employers do not adhere to the clauses of the agreements (up to 50%). Employers in smaller companies prefer one-sidedly to announce the Work Rules and Remuneration Rules: you do not have to negotiate them with trade unions and changing them is easy . Sectoral-level collective agreements are a very weak social dialogue institution in Poland. In reality, there exist 10 sectoral collective agreements, five in multi-national companies and three in the public sector. Only the Confederation of Polish Employers counts among its members organisations that have signed these agreements. The development of social dialogue is made difficult due to the overall recession climate in the private sector and the budgetary limitations in the public sector. On top of this, high unemployment (18%) makes the atmosphere of dialogue in the Tripartite Committee very difficult and the parties unwilling to compromise. The employers interpret the signing of any agreement whatsoever as a lasting obligation that will be hard to fulfil in the difficult economic situation. It is only recently that a solution was adopted that in practice makes it possible for employers to withdraw from the agreement, so maybe this will weaken their dislike of collective bargaining. The new regulations relating to the public sector might also influence a greater inclination towards collective bargaining. The system of industrial relations is politicised: trade unions are \u2018attached to\u2019 or support \u2018their\u2019 political parties, games take place in Parliament concerning the shape of labour relations; before appropriate negotiations commence between the social partners. These social partners have the illusion that an appropriate Parliamentary Act will secure their interests. The Solidarity Trade Union is at present in opposition to the Government. OPZZ is attached to the Democratic Left Alliance as a result of the many years of cooperation, but is trying to keep its distance from some governmental proposals and in that way to exert pressure, especially as far as the intentions of liberalising the Labour Code are concerned. Employer organisations lean towards the Citizen\u2019s Platform but they also are influential with the Democratic Left Alliance. Industrial conflicts Strikes have been used relatively rarely during these past years as a tool for exerting pressure. They take place in the public sector. A few cases of strikes in the private sector occur when companies are being closed down, these are wildcat strikes, often combined with other forms of protest (hunger, demonstrations, road blocks or blocking public buildings, protest marches). All strikes are of the occupational type because that is the strike tradition in Poland. The figures below that show a high number of strikes in the year 1999 stem from the fact that the Trade Unions of Nurses organised at that time a nation-wide protest in defence of real wage levels. The decline in real wages was brought about as a result of the public health care reform. The small number of strikes does not reflect the atmosphere in employee environments: strikes are simply perceived as a tool that is ineffective in achieving one\u2019s own rights. Maastricht criteria and the economic context of social dialogue From among all the Maastricht criteria, it is the budget deficit that is the most sensitive problem. Expenditure cuts in the public sector are immediately and directly reflected in the condition of professional groups employed in public sector institutions. The public finance crisis of 2001 made 207 Social dialogue and EMU in Poland ",
        "the government withdraw from the expected indexation for public sector employees for a period of two years. Table 4 Strikes in Poland 1990-2000 Years Number of strikes Employees on strike in a given section (%) 1990 250 1.1 1995 42 0.2 1999 920 0.3 2000 44 0.1 The most striking conflict occurred in the healthcare sector two years ago. The public health service reform and the cutting of funds going into this sector resulted in a deterioration of the economic condition of nurses and midwives. They organised numerous local strikes and a nation-wide protest by occupying public buildings and organising street blockages. The government negotiated with them and this led to a deregulation of labour relations in this sector. However, this did not solve the problem. In this case, it is not possible to talk about an effective social dialogue. Budgetary limitations also mean an end to subsidising companies and sectors that produce losses. Such a move will directly affect the economic condition of those labour groups that are characterised by a high degree of trade-unionisation, since it concerns industrial sectors in the sector of state enterprises or companies of the state treasury. Experience teaches us that these groups are capable of organising social protests, therefore social dialogue is necessary and in this case, it is a dialogue with an active role for state bodies. The government has also made many changes in the central administration by closing down certain government agendas. Whether these changes were real and whether they will in fact decrease employment in central administration and its expenditure, will be seen after assessing execution of this year\u2019s budget. These changes were not subject to social dialogue. Budgetary expenditure cuts for local governments were also not discussed, not even in the forum of the Tripartite Committee, although they do affect the economic condition of teachers employed mainly by local governments, and the economic conditions of all other local government administration employees. The numbers of tasks that these governments have to perform are growing and this is not accompanied by appropriate budget subsidies. Budgetary expenditures are also being cut in such a way that the government is trying to decrease social benefit expenditures. Access to different types of benefits is being limited, their levels are decreasing or they are re-valued with a certain delay. The most obvious example of this is that only 20% of the unemployed are on the dole, with its substitution indicator in relation to wages amounting to 23%. Trade unions are of course negatively disposed towards such steps and interpret them as a deprivation of vested rights. Aiming at low inflation ceased to be regarded as significant at present, because over the past years, inflation has declined drastically. Inflationary supplements, the so-called wage indexation that trade unions had successfully struggled for, are no longer as important as a few years ago. Also the business environment no longer expresses understanding of anti-inflationary policy: the opinion 208 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "that prevails here is that such a low level of inflation is rather an indication of the cooling-down of the economy. A few years ago, fighting inflation was interpreted as being the fundamental condition for running a business. The workforce is not particularly interested in long-term interest rates, since this indicator reflects rather the price of capital. The exchange rate, however, is a matter of interest for the workforce. Following the Russian crisis, Poland freed the local currency exchange rate. In the opinion of commentators, the Polish zloty is currently too strong, pointing to the perspective of Poland\u2019s accession to the European Union, making the zloty an attractive investment. The attractiveness of this is strengthened by the Government public debt policy \u2013 the issuing of long-term state treasury securities with a high stable interest rate. A strong zloty contributes to the relatively low level of competitiveness of Polish companies. Trade unions are slowly starting to understand the relation between the low competitiveness of companies and stable employment. The government, in deciding to maintain a relatively high budget deficit, and to increase public debt to finance this deficit, is acting under trade union pressure. It also wishes to devote money to important purposes (e.g., construction of the economic infrastructure, strengthening of courts, improvement of public safety). Main social problems in labour relations The fact that the social partners hold on to their significantly different stands with regard to the main social problems makes the achievement of any social agreement extremely difficult. Aiming at achieving the criteria of economic convergence means aiming to achieve a strong, healthy economy based on solid foundations. In Poland, this has become possible thanks to the wide privatisation process and the opening of the economy to outside markets. The strategy required at present is one that aims at increasing the competitiveness of the Polish economy, i.e., facilitate utilisation of those resources that constitute its trump card. The attitude represented by employers puts the emphasis on a cheap labour force that could constitute a certain positive resource as well as the potential to take over those production areas and services that are being abandoned by the more developed economies. Hence, this focus is placed on the development of the periphery and of taking advantage of the gaps created by the European and the world economic system. As a result of this, the thesis put forward in employer circles is that the costs of employment are too high, and the labour regulations do not offer the assurance of a satisfactory level of workforce mobility required during the period of economic restructuring and growing competition. These arguments are only partially shared by the trade unions. They point out that the Labour Code does in fact offer the possibility for flexible arrangements of employment contracts. This corresponds to the expert opinion of the World Bank research group, which described the flexibility offered by the Polish Labour Code to be within the boundaries of the average regulations in force in the European Union Countries. 4 209 Social dialogue and EMU in Poland 4 Riboud Michelle, Silva, Jauregui Carlos, Sanchez- Parmo Carolina, 2001 \u2013 \u2018Does \u2018Eurosclerosis\u2019 have an effect? Institutional Reforms and the situation on the labour market in Central and Eastern Europe in the 90s\u2019, Rynek Pracy, no. 9 (117). ",
        "The second argument expressed by employers relates to high labour costs, especially in the case of an employee who is sick or defending him/herself from being given notice. The expert opinion of the World Bank research group evaluated that in Poland it is in fact only the extra-salary labour costs that are high. Those who are in employment, through the taxes that they pay, must support a relatively large group of pensioners, handicapped and the unemployed. Hence, the fees and salary taxes are high and they constitute a considerable burden for every employer. Both these issues, i.e. more flexible forms of employment and extra-salary labour costs, are the subject of social dialogue within the Tripartite Committee at the national level. This dialogue, however, is of a superficial nature, as the social partners present rigid stands and try to achieve their goals outside of the social dialogue process, mainly in the political arena by gaining the support of political parties, members of parliament and by exerting influence on public opinion. However, the power arrangements in the political arena do not clearly favour the employers or the labour force. Public opinion does not seem to be absolutely convinced of the rights of any one of the social partners. Therefore, in practice, we are dealing with such a specific situation that in spite of an 18% unemployment level it is difficult to reach any kind of agreement. Such a partly agreement has been reach this year and this has been evaluated as the success of the Ministry of Labor. The main social problem \u2013 as perceived by trade unions \u2013 is to maintain jobs at the moment and fight the causes of unemployment. Unemployment of the younger generation, in particular, constitutes a serious problem. Trade unions are of the opinion that it is the government that is responsible for unemployment, because it does not protect the local market against imports from countries that subsidise heavily certain types of production and that apply very strong protectionist policies by way of export subsidies. Trade union activists point to the examples of European Union countries, the United States, Japan and China. It is a fact that the number of young people entering the labour market has been very high during the past years. In the years 1974-1985, there were over 650,000 children born every year, most of them in the years 1979-1985. As a result of this, the population of 20-year olds amounted to over 690,000 in the year 2000, over 690,000 in 2001, 700,000 in 2002, 720,000 in 2003, 690,000 in 2004. Of course, a considerable number of 20-year olds are still studying at universities or other schools. The scholarly coefficient of the tertiary education level amounted to 40.7% in the year 2000, following a dramatic increase from a level of 11% in the year 1995. The increase of the scholarly coefficient took place thanks to increased family expenditure on education and not as a result of increased public expenditure. Unemployment among graduates and the young generation is still very high, reaching a level of over 40%. Such a high unemployment indicator among the young has negative psychological, social and economic consequences. Young people in their productive years are much better educated than the generation of their parents: the proportion of young people with higher education is 2.5 times higher than that of the generation of their parents. Their education profiles are more suited to the needs of a market economy than the profiles of their parents\u2019 generation that were trained to meet the needs of an economy based on planning. Young people are learning foreign languages, using computers, functioning from the very beginning in a society that is more open and governed by principles of economic activity. From the start, they are better prepared for the market economy than their parents. 210 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The young generation in Poland remains an unutilised valuable resource. If it stays that way, it will remain a burden to society, and especially to families which have invested in their children\u2019s higher level of education. The families are forced to continue to support them because there is no work for them. Focusing on the unemployment of the young calls for abandoning old arguments in which social partners had locked themselves into and which are at present the subject of a conflict of a symbolic nature (for example, the issue of Labour Code amendments). Addressing a new matter might bring the parties closer together, especially if they are united in the desire to solve a common problem. \u2018Social Pact for the Young\u2019 programme A programme is needed that would create jobs for young people, a programme that would be agreed upon by the social partners. Each of them is in possession of some resources, and, therefore, is able to support this programme in different ways. With regard to its concept, it is based on the standards formulated in the Amsterdam Treaty. A \u2018Social Pact for the Young\u2019 is needed in the sphere of employment and job creation. The manner in which it will be developed and negotiated by the social partners shall offer a basis for setting in motion complex activities aiming at greater social mobilisation of the young generation. The professional activation of the young is the most valuable plan of action from the perspective of economic stability. First, the benefit of such a solution is that young people in their first job do not get \u2018dequalified\u2019, but the contrary: as a social resource, they gain professional experience and increase their skills level, becoming thus an even more valuable resource. Their qualifications, skills, talents, motivation become a positive element of the labour market. They become financially self-reliant and cease to be a burden to their families and the state budget. Apart from this, they pay taxes and pension fees, they make investments relating to lifestyle and further their education and they spend money on the consumer market. Employing them means working towards a stable future, stable progress. Employment of the young is a safeguard against the development of numerous pathologies, increased crime among the young, being affected by extreme ideologies. The Social Pact for the Young should be comprised of four pillars of actions: 1. a component of creating jobs for graduates 2. a component of creating occupational training for graduates 3. a component of creating places of work that the young people get involved in as self- employment 4. a component of developing the labour market infrastructure These components are addressed to different groups within the young workforce, mutually supporting and supplementing themselves, and all of them together help young people to operate on the labour market, increasing its clarity, strengthening tendencies of mobility and entrepreneurship. 1. \u2018Creating jobs for graduates\u2019 Young people who are trying to enter the labour market for the first time are faced with significant problems relating to acquiring appropriate practical skills concerning the labour market 211 Social dialogue and EMU in Poland ",
        "competition. Although it is true that Poland recently introduced a reform of vocational education that aims at better preparation of graduates for the needs of the dynamically changing labour market, it will take time before the effects of this reform willl bear fruit. Young people need job experience, especially in a valuable job environment. In recent years, a \u2018Programme for Graduates\u2019 was implemented in Poland, some components of which turned out to be quite effective (e.g., graduate contracts). However, the range of this programme was rather limited. Such a programme should include practically every unemployed graduate for a period of more than six months. This objective was created in relation to all those unemployed within the framework of the \u2018National Strategy of Growth in Employment, Development of Human Resources in the years 2000-2006\u2019, but its implementation was insufficient due to limited means/funds. This also means that the professional employment services need to become stronger, and that there should be individual cooperation with the best companies in a given region. In Poland, there exist a number of proven, specialised forms of actions aimed at unemployed youth or graduates. However, they do not include all the unemployed youth systematically. Among such activities, there are: (cid:2) year-long training scholarships for unemployed graduates; (cid:2) year-long job experience scholarships for unemployed graduates; (cid:2) graduate contracts that assume that the employers are partially refunded with the costs of employing graduates; (cid:2) scholarships for post-primary education for graduates residing in regions threatened by structural unemployment; (cid:2) financing interventionist work addressed to graduates; (cid:2) financing public work addressed to graduates; (cid:2) organising Youth Job Clubs which offer information about the labour market, assist in job- seeking, in preparing for the meeting with the employer and in preparing certain necessary documents (CV, letter of motivation), offering support by organising psychological support groups. More frequently than is the case at the moment, Youth Job Clubs should act as a basis for a combined programme component addressed mainly at graduates. To begin with, there should be at least one in every powiat (powiat= medium-level administration unit), and the objective should be to have one Youth Job Club per thousand unemployed young persons or one in every gmina (gmina= lowest level administration unit). Such clubs should be run as has been the case so far, by different types of foundations, associations, trade unions, and student self-governing bodies. The staff could partially be based on the institution of voluntary work of young people. They should be specialised with regard to the different graduate groups. In their work methods, they should use the Internet and specialist advice also via e-mail. 2. \u2018Creating occupational training for graduates\u2019 Graduates leave schools and universities with skills not accepted by Polish employers. This component of the programme deals in particular with graduates after the basic vocational education. The valuable occupational experience organised in the workplace would be the 212 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "opportunity for learning the work rules and directions, and what further training should be undergone. This occupational experience could be organised by the employer associations, who know who is the best employer in the community, who adopts the best organisational practice, and who is able to get in the most positive pattern of work. Previous graduate training programmes are evaluated as profitable for young people. They very often lead to the decision to offer the graduate a job. The training is a proper opportunity for an awareness of the young person of his/her motivation, ability, genius and aspiration. Employers are often afraid to enlarge the field of business because of the lack of proper candidates for the job in terms of the competence and loyalty. The training gives the employer an idea of the future worker without any obligation towards him/her. If such training was organised by the employer associations, they would encompass more graduates. 3. \u2018Creating places of work that the young people get involved in as self-employment\u2019 The second programme component would relate to young people creating workplaces and this would be in the form of activities that support their capability for self-employment. Certain elements of this programme already do exist within the framework of the Labour Ministry\u2019s programme \u2018The first job\u2019. They include legal regulations, i.e., being released from the obligation to pay a pension fee for one whole year from the moment when the graduate had founded his/her own business/company. In university circles, there are also workshops organised for students and for graduates that are looking for advice on how to organise their own company. Participants of such workshops are introduced to methods that allow them to identify attractive market niches, they receive advice how in practice to establish a company and how to run it, taking into account the laws relating to running economic activities. They are also introduced to the principles of the financial construction of business plans. There still are not enough of these types of initiatives as compared to the needs. Organising \u2018Youth Entrepreneurship Centres\u2019 in every gimna as part of the Youth Job Clubs or as an independent structure would mean a continuous level of consultancy in this sphere. In particular, such centres could be established attached to employer unions, entrepreneurship associations or economic chambers, enabling the entire movement of employers to join in with valuable social activities aiming at fighting unemployment. Youth Entrepreneurship Centres could also be organised in connection with University Career Offices, in the form of Student Entrepreneurship Centres. 4. \u2018Developing the labour market infrastructure\u2019 Strengthening social dialogue, especially on its lower levels, constitutes in itself an important infrastructure element of the labour market because it acts in favour of negotiations that are based on an understanding of interests that the employer and employee have in common. Other solutions included in the Pact are: Youth Entrepreneurship Centres and Youth Job Clubs, if sufficiently accessible, they would be a highly desired element of the infrastructure based on practical and expert knowledge, that is being dispersed where needed. If the social partners would become involved in the running of the new or the more numerous Centres and Clubs, this would strengthen their position. The Government, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy in particular, would be financing a programme that it could control. The Trade Unions and other interested non-governmental sector organisations would be financially strengthened and also strengthened from the public relations angle. Trade Unions, by supporting 213 Social dialogue and EMU in Poland ",
        "Youth Job Clubs, would be able to present their offer to future employees, young people, and their potential future members. Employer unions would be able to influence future employers already at the start of their business careers. Organising interactive Internet pages to initiate contacts with the unemployed young and to continue working with them could support such a programme. Some advice could be offered based on the FAQ procedure. Subjects of the Social Pact for the Young The \u2018Social Pact for the Young\u2019 calls for negotiations at different levels of social dialogue. As an initiative, it calls for dialogue on the state level because the Government would be a serious participant in formulating the principles and financing the programme. The Government needs in particular to make estimations, also concerning those postponed, long-term benefits of the Social Pact for the Young. Social dialogue on the level of voivodships (voivodship= highest level of administration unit) could become strengthened by the initiative being already taken on the lower level. The problem of additional elements of actions within the framework of a programme calls for trade union and employer organization negotiations, who have the human resources and the know-how about the way in which the labour market functions or the way in which to run a company. Only combining this into one resource body that remains at the disposal of the Government, the territorial administration, trade unions, employer unions, the non-governmental sector \u2013 would it produce a synergy effect in the form of a place where the young person may receive support \u2013 in the wide sense of the word \u2013 for his/her professional stabilisation. Each one of the resources that the social partners have at their separate disposal remains dormant, and only when combined can they produce a practical effect. An important aspect of such cooperation would be experiencing the benefits that flow from it. This would strengthen the social dialogue that looks to the future, to the young generation, that prepares young people to be able to move around more efficiently on the market, to become familiar in recognising its mechanisms. Stages of the Social Pact for the Young Necessary actions would include: 1. Holding a national seminar with wide participation of the social partners, on the topic of the common monetary policy of the European Union, its goals and ways in which the Polish economy can come closer to the principles of stable development included in this policy. Showing that the Pact for the Young can be an element of support for stable economic development, by mobilising the most valuable resources, such as the skilled numerous young labour forces and a more authentic social dialogue.

Discussing the idea, whether the idea being in practice implemented in Ireland of devoting an additional 1% of taxes to unemployed youth is worthy of consideration 2. Negotiations relating to the possible input of social partners in the establishment of numerous Youth Job Clubs (YJC) and Youth Entrepreneurship Centres (YEC). 3. Founding local advisory bodies comprised of representatives of the interested social partners that would develop concepts of co-operation between the YJC and YEC in a given area. 214 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

Propagation of the idea of the Pact in vocational as well as higher education-level schools, in order to reach the young people before they leave school. 7. Commencing with the implementation of the programme \u2018Pact for the Young\u2019. SWOT analysis In case if planning some kind of actions, the SWOT-type analysis makes it possible to determine whether this actions is worth undertaking and what might be lost if the given type of challenge is not faced. Strengths These comprise strong points that speak in favour of undertaking a given type of actions, that is \u2013 the \u2018Pact for the Young\u2019. A few elements might be regarded as the strong points. This is mainly the issue of the relative good level of preparation of the young generation to function on the labour market because of their qualifications, professional and social skills. As a result of this, giving up any attempts aiming at professional activation of the demographic peak generation would be a waste of the social and cultural capital accumulated inside this generation. Another important strong point would be the combined experience of the social partners, meaning that they are currently involved in position games in the sphere of labour relations, the effectiveness of which is very low. During the period of the last 10 years in Poland, co-operation games concerning labour relations were avoided, social dialogue was conducted under Government control and trade unions and employers were internally divided in their aspirations and goals. There have recently been attempts to hold discussions and negotiations of a bilateral nature. They were broken but this means that trade unions and employer unions are beginning to recognise each other\u2019s significance and to assess that they can play an independent role in defining goals that they consider to be important. This is a good base for using social dialogue as a way to resolve important social problems. Weakness These might cause disturbances in the social dialogue relating to the EMU and working on the concept of the Social Pact for the Young. Without doubt, the disarray of trade unions as well as of the social business organisations constitutes such a weak point. Trade unions are divided because of their different political options, tradition, experience and their own history. Employer organisations are divided as a result of personal ambitions of their leaders, each one of which is convinced that it is he who should lead the others. The position of the leaders is connected rather with controlling access to the political system than with economic resources. The weakness stems therefore from the necessity to reconcile different reasons and ambitions of all parties to the social dialogue. The present budgetary deficit constitutes another internal weakness; the Government is cutting down on all expenditures that, in the Government\u2019s opinion, can be postponed till later. Among such expenditures, there recently are also those that aim at fighting unemployment and its consequences. Already in the past, ambitious plans to devote proportionally more money to active 215 Social dialogue and EMU in Poland ",
        "forms of unemployment prevention than to passive ones were set aside. These active forms included spending on training, training scholarships, graduate job experience, loans for the unemployed, so-called special programmes, while the passive ones were unemployment benefits, pre-retirement benefits, and job agencies. Unfortunately the 5% increase in unemployment and the increased budgetary deficit halted the implementation of these plans. Expenditure on unemployment prevention among graduates and young unemployed is future-oriented. From the short-term perspectives of an annual budget, such spending may seem unnecessary. Opportunities These come from the outside and can be beneficial for running the business. Certainly the expected accession of Poland to the European Union is such a favourable external situation, as well as benefiting from the functioning of one large uniform market. This, however, is an expected opportunity that will take place in the future and it is difficult to interpret it as something realistic at present. It has a certain value as a partial solution to problems relating to employing the demographic peak generation. It constitutes a certain hope that is very much needed for collective actions because it gives meaning to the future. This hope contributes to weakening the radical attitudes among young people who seem to be waiting for better, calmer times. This opportunity, however, is also a certain threat. The possible migration of young people to the labour markets of the European Union would be a loss of the capital that had been invested into these young people, including social capital; it would be a loss for the economy and for future generations. Especially the demographic peak generation of the fifties, that is the parents of the present demographic peak of the 20-year olds are afraid of the draining effect of the European labour markets, the young people leaving, ageing of society. It is a certain opportunity that there exists within the European Union\u2019s system a pattern of handling serious social problems on the basis of social dialogue. Especially the way in which unemployment is dealt with in Ireland offers an opportunity that can be taken advantage of in order to solve the problem of mass unemployment, as well as other cases of agreements between social partners in EU countries with a pluralistic system of labour relations (e.g., France, Italy) similar to the Polish system. Threats These are external threats that refer to the phenomena of global scale competition and the economic relations between Poland, EU and Russia. Without doubt, Poland always tried to benefit from its central location in Europe. It was oriented towards the huge Russian market with its millions of consumers. Certain traditional industries such as textiles, food, shoes, cosmetics, furniture, entertainment were directed onto the Russian market and they secured thousands of jobs. The Russian market is interesting also for the European Union countries. In this sense, there is a collision of interests between Poland and the European Union, especially in the field of agricultural exports. Agricultural produce subsidies in the European Union make the Polish offer less attractive. Generally, the threat stems therefore from the fact that the Polish economy is at present more open to the world market, and its companies are not competitive enough to protect their work places. If this situation shall continue, the level of long-term unemployment will continue to be high, also for the young generation. 216 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "What are the stakes that make social dialogue concerning the creation of jobs worthwhile? The stake is to enable the young generation of Poles to work for Poland. The young generation always looks for a worthy life, and this means work that secures such a life. Social dialogue relating to the creation of jobs is an answer to such expectations. The social partners have a unique opportunity to stop the defensiveness of their actions. In the process of the dialogue, they may work out or enrich a programme that will be beneficial to all parties to the social dialogue. Summary The short description of the programme in terms of what, why, who, when: WHAT: Social Pact for the Young with three components: a component of creating jobs for graduates, a component of creating places of work that the young people get involved in as self- employment, component of developing the labour market infrastructure. WHY: increasing the competitiveness of the Polish economy, by utilisation of the resources inherent in the young Polish generation. WHO: trade unions, employers associations, voluntary associations and governmental agencies in process of co-operation. WHEN: the stage of critical discussion focus on the Social Pact for the Young, the stage of negotiation the input given by the industrial relations partners, the stage of the training and mobilising the institutional resources of partners and stage of implementation of the programme.

        "Ludovit Cziria, Institute of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, Bratislava Jan Kosta, Institute of Slovak and World Economy, Bratislava The main objective of this national report is briefly to characterise the economic and social problems in Slovakia and also the consequences that arise from this development for the field of industrial relations. The study can be used as a starting position for discussion, both by the social partners in Slovakia and the European experts, on potential problems of preserving social conciliation. In view of the fact that in Slovakia not all agreed economic reforms in connection with increasing competitiveness have yet been completed, discussion is needed on maintaining social dialogue and of finding ways of strengthening social cohesion, which, in the enlarged European Union, will be needed if all expectations are to be fulfilled. Political situation The Slovak Republic was established on 1 January 1993 and the expectations of Slovak citizens towards their first democratic state were fulfilled. The first government was a coalition of political parties headed by the first Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, who stayed in power after the general elections in 1994 until the next elections in 1998. Slovakia applied for membership of the European Union in 1995, during the EU Summit in Nice. The political instability of the new country has arisen from insufficient experience and deficient tradition of functioning standard political parties. Many political parties have emerged and soon after disappeared or amalgamated; however, the politicians have mostly remained the same from the beginning of the 1990s. Up until now in each general election, including the last elections in 2002, at least one political party has been elected that has only been established in the run-up period to the election. Besides these political parties, dubbed \u2018the political parties for one term\u2019, after each election at least one of these new political parties has become the party of governmental coalition. In 1994, it was the Party of Workers, in 1998 the Party of Civil Understanding (of which the political leader was the present President of Slovakia, Rudolf Schuster) and in 2002 the political party ANO, with liberal political orientation. Above all, the dissatisfaction with the results of economic reforms has meant that voters in each general election have turned with a new hope to new political parties. Before the elections in 1998, the trade unions expressed themselves clearly for the change of government and in this sense indirectly supported the political opposition at that time. The citizens voted clearly in the 1998 general election for the political parties in opposition, as evidence of dissatisfaction with the political and economic situation. Also, the return of the Communist party to Parliament in the 2002 elections was a display from part of the electorate of dissatisfaction with the economic and social situation. Table 1 (overleaf) gives an overview of the results of the elections from 1994 to 2002, and confirms the relatively high number of political parties in Parliament, in spite of the 5% threshold for the entry of political party into Parliament. This has required the necessity to create coalition governments, which has lead to ambiguous political and economic decisions being made. After the 1998 elections, the government of Mikulas Dzurinda has contributed to the adoption of Slovakia to the OECD and has improved, in comparison with the previous government, the chances of Slovakia being adopted by NATO. Also, Slovakia has overtaken other accession Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia 9 219 ",
        "countries in the negotiation process into the EU. The referendum on the accession of Slovakia to the EU took place in May 2003. Although the share of voters participating in the referendum reached a little less than 53%, about 92% of participating voters accepted the accession of the country to the EU. Table 1 Political parties of governmental coalitions in parliamentary elections (% of gained votes) Elections Political party Political orientation % share of votes 1994 Movement for Democratic Slovakia popular party 34.96 Slovak Workers Association party of workers 7.34 Slovak National Party national party 5.40 1998 Slovak Democratic Coalition conservative party 26.33 Party of Democratic Left leftist party 14.66 Hungarian Coalition Party conservative party 9.12 Party of Civil Understanding leftist party 8.01 2002 Slovak Democratic and Christian Union conservative party 15.09 Hungarian Coalition Party conservative party 11.16 Christian Democratic Party conservative party 8.25 ANO \u2013 Alliance of New Citizen liberal party 8.01 Source: Statistical Yearbooks of Slovakia In 1997, Slovakia reorganised the internal administration of the state: from the previous 38 regions, 78 regions were created. In 2002, 8 districts were established, with important strengthening of self- governing functions as a consequence of the decentralisation of the state administration. Some significant economic powers were given to new districts, powers that up to then had been under the control of central government. The Slovak government is since 2002 for the first time a purely right-wing government and it upholds the typical right-wing political and economic reforms that could elicit the interruption of social dialogue with trade unions. In view of the forthcoming accession of Slovakia to the EU and the difficult social situation of citizens, the political parties in opposition (with the exception of the Communists) are in no hurry to destabilise the government or to provoke preliminary elections; on the contrary, they enforce the political stability and preservation of the four-party coalition in government at least until the time of accession of Slovakia to the EU. Economic situation Decline of the Slovak economy started after price liberalisation from 1991 onwards, during the era of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. In one year, unemployment increased to 300 thousand and the rate of unemployment reached 11.8%. The degradation of the main economic indicators continued in the first year of existence of the new Slovak Republic (1993). In July 1993, the National Bank of Slovakia had to devaluate the Slovak crown by 10% due to using up foreign currency reserves. However, in 1994 the recovery of the economy began, by way of increasing exports, and the Slovak economy maintains this general increasing trend, although the growth rate is not stable. Table 2 shows the main economic indicators of economic development since 1998. 220 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

Source : Statistical Office of Slovakia; National Labour Office GDP and competitiveness The rate of decline of the GDP until 1993 was one of the steepest in the transforming countries. The fall of GDP in constant prices in the time period 1989-1993 amounted to 20.6%. From 1994, however, Slovakia has scored permanent growth of GDP, but at the expense of more negative economic features. The unit of created GDP demands a high rate of intermediate consumption and this is still connected with the inherited industrial structure in which heavy industry, heavy machinery and chemical production dominated. Slovakia is slow to recover due to increasing the rate of added value to the unit of import of raw materials that the country imports in high extent. The share of added value on the value of gross output reached 38.9% in 2002. According to the results of international comparisons of competitiveness of countries (Global Competitiveness Report, 2002; Frenfel et al , 2003), Slovakia has lost its previous placement in the last three years. The results are split into two indices. First, the Microeconomic Competitiveness Index (MCI) aims at identifying microeconomic fundamentals behind the contemporary prosperity of a country. This prosperity can be interpreted as GDP per capita and is determined by the productivity level of the economy. In the last three years, Slovakia has dropped from 36th to 42nd place. The second index is the Growth Competitive Index (GCI), which refers to the capability of a country to achieve sustainable growth in terms of GDP per capita over the next 5-8 years and evaluates the level of technology, public institutions and macroeconomic environment. In the case of the GCI, Slovakia\u2019s results are worse and more substantial: the country dropped down from 39th to 49th place. It is clear that the slowdown in the growth of GDP has influenced the results in comparison with the previous period of time. Fulfiling of EMU criteria Coming nearer to the date of accession to the EU invokes greater and greater discussions on the most appropriate model of introducing the euro to Slovakia, whether it should be a slow process or quick. It is clear that the starting position of Slovakia has been influenced by the 4-year political cycle that has decelerated the economic reforms of each Slovak government before the approaching general election, which has led in some periods of time to the postponing of the 221 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "growth of inflation, public finance deficit and state debt deficit. The governmental adverse financial policy has caused the state banks to be restructured via financial subsidies from the state budget and then via selling the banks to foreign investors. In 2002, the deceleration of interest rates has, however, been influenced by the development of the inflation rate. Inflation The price liberalisation introduced at the beginning of 1991 caused inflation that unfavourably influenced the overall economic development. The economy needed about four years to recover and then inflation fell to a level below 10%. In the period 1995-96, inflation was curbed at the lower level by the system of controlling growth rate of wages in the state sector (elimination of inflation). As the long-term development affirms, inflation pressures have come from the growing prices of production inputs (cost-push inflation) and then from the increased state expenditures on social protection (increase of expenditures on state administration, education, health service, etc.). Governments have tried to eliminate this development by increasing taxes, first of all by increasing VAT and then by increasing consumption taxes (petrol, alcohol, cigarettes, etc.) Above all, the lower level of VAT (imposed on foodstuffs) has been increased from 6% to 10% and most recently to 14%. The higher tarif (imposed on industrial products) was lowered from 23% to 20% last year. The last price increase for energy and water came in 2003 and inflation is supposed to rise to a level of between 7.7-9.7% this year (according to the monetary forecast of the National Bank of Slovakia). Because the government did not increase prices before the 2002 election, inflation only reached 3.3%. Stability of exchange rate Immediately before the 1998 election, the National Bank of Slovakia decided to change the exchange rate regime from a fixed to a floating one. The reason for this was the unfavourable development of the balance of payments in the years 1996-98 and the decrease of hard currency reserves in the years 1997-99. After changing exchange rate regime, the exchange rate of the Slovak crown (SKK) in relation to the euro has relatively stabilised. The Slovak exchange rate regime could be called a \u2018controlled floating\u2019. Since about the middle of the year 2000, the exchange rate of the Slovak crown to the euro has fluctuated in the set interval. According to information from the EU Commissioner, Pedro Solbes, during his last visit to Bratislava in June 2003, the acceding countries will not be obliged to keep the exchange rates in the interval +/-2.25% and an oscillation of +/-15% around the central parity will be tolerated. First of all, a stable exchange rate and stable macroeconomic situation would be decisive in influencing the entry of the country into EMU. The criterion +/-15% of oscillation limit in the last 2 years before entering EMU seems to be attainable for Slovakia. State budget deficit This Maastricht criterion for accession to EMU will be one of the most problematic in relation to the possible social consequences that might result from fulfilling it. The state budget deficit has been influenced by the 4-year political cycle and has been connected both with the governmental policy in the field of regulated prices (the prices of energy, gas and water of large state enterprises, which have now been sold to foreign firms) and with the necessity of financing public services. 222 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The intrinsic value of state budget deficit depends to a large extent on the chosen methodology (methodology GFS = methodology of IMF, methodology ESA 95 = European System of National Accounts). The intricacy in the evaluation of the share of state budget deficit in GDP follows from the fact that \u2018fiscal processes\u2019 in recent years were predominantly influenced by huge, extraordinary and occasional receipts and expenditures. To the most important items of this kind belong the receipts from privatisation, paying out privatisation obligations, outlays on restructuring industrial firms and banks, payment settlements for governmental guarantees and the transfers to the state funds. In view of the great extent of these operations, the use of different accounting procedures goes to the different results. Ratio of state debt to GDP The criterion of state debt as a ratio to GDP is not defined absolutely in the Maastricht Treaty. If the state debt is higher than 60% of GDP, the state deficit should be approaching the reference value. Slovakia still fulfils this criterion, first of all because the state debt at the beginning of transformation (and also after the splitting up of the former Czech and Slovak Federative Republic) was relatively low. The situation, however, is rapidly worsening. If this trend continues, probably in the year 2007 the ratio of state debt to GDP will increase above the 60% reference level. Labour market developments The price liberalisation, break up of eastern markets and primary restructuring of state enterprises brought about the fact that already, at the end of 1991, the number of unemployed persons had reached 302 thousand and the rate of unemployment 11.8%. Slovakia belongs to a small number of countries in which, in the 1990s, the important influence of demographic factors on the labour market appeared. From 1990 until 1998, the population growth in the productive age group was 305.4 thousand persons. Part of this population growth was retained in the education system; however, the increase of labour supply amounted to from 140 to 150 thousand of a new labour force. Apart from this, leaving the labour market had been strongly supported, mainly by women and workers of post-productive age. From 1998-2002, the population growth in productive age (up to 55 years for woman and 60 for men) reached 79.4 thousand by which the influence of demographic factors on labour supply slackened. But also in this period the second phase of restructuring of large enterprises was accomplished (including enterprises sold to foreign owners) and therefore unemployment increased as old jobs were not replaced by new ones. The change of government in 1998 promised a change of employment policy. Up until 1998, investments had been directed to the energy sector and generally to the large state enterprises with long-term capita return. Also at this time, state banks extended many consolidated credits, after which the restructuring of banks and their selling out to foreign banks followed. After 1998, the government began to orientate itself to selling off domestic state enterprises and also to support big foreign investors in the form of tax credits. Unemployment increased further in the second half of the 1990s, particularly in the more underdeveloped regions, and differences began to deepen among the regions. In 1998, the difference between the regions with the highest and lowest rate of unemployment was 20.0 percentage points; in 2002, it was 35.5 percentage 223 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "points. Opinions have been presented that the regional problem of unemployment in Slovakia could be solved by differentiated levels of minimum wage. The long-term changes in the structure of unemployed persons have given rise to two serious problems. The first is the high unemployment of the age group up to 25 years. If we take into account the unemployment of the next 5-year age group, then the aggregate unemployment of the age group 15-29 years in 2002 decreased by 2.5 percentage points in comparison to 2001, but its level is very high \u2013 38.7%. The expected ageing of the population has made inevitable an increase in the age limit for drawing a pension, with negative influence on the employment of young people. The second problem is long-term unemployment, which has increased enormously; in 2002, the average number of months for unemployed people to be on the register of labour offices reached 13.7 months. The high number of long-term unemployed has initiated the introduction of a special programme for long-term unemployed persons (publicly useful works).

Source : Statistical Office of Slovakia; National Labour Office. The pace of ageing of Slovakia\u2019s population will be lower than in the majority of European countries. According to projections, the number of inhabitants of productive age (15 to 65 years) should begin to decrease very slowly in 2008. Regardless of a slowdown in the increase of this part of the population until 2007 in comparison with the 1990s, the situation of the labour market will be complicated by prolongation of the age limit for drawing old-age pensions. The situation at the labour market can be improved with the high probability after expiration of transitional periods for free movement of labour in the enlarged EU and after the outflow of part of the Slovak labour force abroad (at present about 80 thousand Slovak citizens work abroad, of which about 65 thousand work in the Czech Republic). Labour market policies In 1994, Slovakia changed the system of unemployment insurance formerly connected with the state budget to the independent tripartite system. With minimal deviations the contributions to the 224 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "unemployment fund have remained the same and are paid from the gross amount of wages (or from assessment base of gross wages). The employers pay a contribution of 3% and employees 1%. It is clear that under conditions of a high and growing rate of unemployment, also after 1999, when the replacement ratios were strongly diminished, the financial resources of unemployment fund controlled by the National Labour Office (NLO) were not sufficient to increase substantially the expenditures on active measures. The lowest ratio of expenditures on active part of labour market policies was registered in 1999 when from the whole amount of outlays of NLO only 6.1% went on active measures. If in the years of the highest expenditures on active labour market policy measures (1995 and 1996) these expenditures represented the ratio on GDP 0.72% and 0.71%, in 1999 it was only 0.058%. This unpropitious development in 1999 compelled the government to earmark from the state budget outstanding sources for active labour market policy measures and especially from the programme of \u2018Publicly Useful Works\u2019 for the long-term unemployed. In spite of these special contributions, the ratio of expenditures on GDP stayed at the level of 0.32% and this ratio is lower than that of the UK, at 0.37% in 1998 (Robinson, 2000), which was the lowest ratio of all the EU countries. It is evident that the expenditures on active labour market policy cannot replace other sorts of policies (investment policy, innovation policy and other policies); however, Slovakia lags behind enormously. If the ratios of expenditures made up for active labour policies are summed up in the last 5 years then it is clear, that Slovakia needed approximately 5 years to reach the level of expenditures that the majority of the EU countries attain in one year (in about 9 EU countries regularly the expenditures on active labour market policies exceed 1% of GDP). At the same time, the average level of unemployment rate in Slovakia is about twofold in comparison with the average of the EU countries. From the programme of \u2018Publicly Useful Works\u2019, no permanent jobs were created and the majority of participants have returned after the end of the programme to the registered unemployed. The latest proposals of the government are centred on the decrease of the tax wedge of labour costs. The government wants to transfer the financing of the system of unemployment insurance from the NLO to the state budget. The high deficit of public finances could endanger the expenditures on active labour market policy measures in the future. Besides this, the existing transformation is characterised by insubstantial support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMSs). In the period 1994-2000 the support programmes of SMSs (seed capital and supporting credits programmes) originated only 9.2 thousand new jobs. Under the influence of the EU legislation Slovakia elaborated regular National Action Plans of Employment. Their core is concentrated on the improvement of employability of labour force at the time when minimum new jobs are created. For example in 2002 from the retraining programme only 38% of unemployed found jobs. The support of new jobs creation under the framework of the second pillar of the employment plan, that should be the base of lowering unemployment, is not sufficient. The rate of creation and the rate of termination of SMEs in comparison with the countries of the EU is about half. The low net birth rate of SMEs causes the number of 225 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "entrepreneurs (outside of liabilities companies and business companies) to be at the same level. In the last years the number of entrepreneurs including artisans has stabilised at about 300 thousand and does not increase. Fiscal policy The government wants to continue decreasing taxes of any kind of entrepreneurs and in this way to support the creation of new jobs. The labour costs (the gross wages) of entrepreneurs are taxed at source (gross wages) in total by 38%, of which 10% are the contributions to health insurance fund, 21.6% to pension fund, 3.4% for disability allowance fund and 3% to unemployment fund. Apart from the contributions of employers, employees pay in total 12.8% of taxes in the form of 4% to health insurance fund, 6.9% to pension fund, 1.4% to disability allowance fund and 1% to unemployment fund. The government has expressed its attitude to decreasing taxes of employers in the National action plan of employment as follows: \u2018... in the field of fund contributions: the essential decrease of tax wedge of entrepreneurial sphere that marks up the price of labour and the level of which is nowadays one of the serious causes discouraging employers from creation of new jobs. To proceed to this measure is inevitable in spite of loss of receipts of social security funds that should be compensated by the tax revenues.\u2019 The loss of contributions to social security funds should be substituted by an increase in the lower rate of VAT to the level of 19% (Slovakia will have only one level of VAT from the year 2004 onwards). There are two risks of these tactics of government. The first risk resides in the fact that the transfer of social contributions to indirect taxes would lead to decreasing real income of citizens. The second risk is connected with the consequences of reduction of absolute level of unit labour costs. The unit labour costs in Slovakia belong now unequivocally to the lowest in the region of Visegr\u00e1d countries. In the year 2000 the labour costs per hour in industry and services in Poland came to 4.48 EUR, in the Czech Republic 3.90 EUR, in Hungary 3.83 EUR and in Slovakia 3.06 EUR (Ministry of Labour, 2002). Further decrease of labour costs and its low absolute level can bring about the shift of low-qualified jobs to Slovakia and by this the long-term orientation of low-paid jobs to the country. This manoeuvre is not necessary under conditions when the productivity in foreign firms in Slovakia does not lag behind both the facilities of foreign companies situated in V4 countries and mother companies in countries of the EU. In addition the government wants to give up the tax expenditures without having certainty of future tax receipts into state budget (decrease of aggregate demand and of consumption). If this transfer should happen, then rather under conditions of additional hired labour force, i.e. the tax credits could be applied to the marginal increase of labour costs in connection with expansion of employment. Wages policy Slovakia gets into the trap of low wages in comparison with other neighbouring candidate countries. The detailed comparison of the development of GDP and gross wages in Slovakia with some candidate countries is shown in Table 4. In comparisons of GDP per capita in purchasing power parity Slovakia lags only behind the Czech Republic and has roughly the same GDP per capita as Hungary but higher than Poland. However, in comparison with gross wages in EUR it considerably lags behind the all countries of V4. At the same time the higher unemployment rate in Poland does not explicate such a big difference in Slovakia (the pressure of rate of unemployment to decrease in wages). The backwardness of wages is connected with other economic phenomena (high ERDI = Exchange Rate Deviation Index, low price level, structure of big and small enterprises in economy, the differences in labour productivity 226 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "among sectors and firms, etc.), however, these further factors cannot rationally explain the next absolute (by decreasing social contributions) and relative (in comparison with other countries) decrease in total labour costs and continuation of policy of low wages in Slovakia. The decrease in total labour costs puts Slovakia nearer to the Balkan group of countries. Table 4 Comparison of GDP and gross wages, 2002 Indicator Czech Republic Hungary Poland Slovakia GDP per capita, current prices, PPP, EUR 14,836 12,615 9,805 12,382 Gross monthly wages, EUR 511 502 591 317 GDP, PPP, Slovakia = 100 119.8 101.9 79.2 100 Gross wages, EUR, Slovakia = 100 161.2 158.4 186.4 100 Unemployment rate 7.3 5.8 20.0 19.0 PPP = purchasing power parity; EUR = euro Source : Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from Podkaminer et al (2003) Probably the most important factor that explains the above mentioned differences of Slovakia is connected with the big differences in labour productivity among foreign firms and domestic firms. Above all the foreign firms pursue the policy of transfer prices that can deform not only the development of labour productivity in this particular sector, but in the economy as a whole. It is clear that the wages in foreign firms accommodate to the level in domestic firms (are pressed downwards) and not the contrary. Employment policy The employment policy (policy supporting creation of new jobs) and the wage policy (total labour costs respectively) should follow from taking into account not only the big differences between particular sectors of economy, but among the regions of Slovakia as well. 1 The policy of low wages and low total labour costs is not acceptable under conditions of higher inflow of foreign capital and the backwardness of wages in comparison with neighbouring countries will lead only to increase of profits of these firms without commensurate contributions to the social funds. The employment in industry will not be determined by lowering the tax wedge, but firstly by the technology (fixed capital). If Slovakia wants to solve the unemployment problem that has clearly regional characteristics, the government has to change the support to creation of new firms (not only foreign firms, but domestic ones as well) in lagging behind regions and it cannot rely itself only on the marginal increase of employment in existing firms but firstly in lagging behind regions. This approach would not solve the structural problem of the Slovak economy (the low level of added value). The optimal employment policy in Slovakia after accession of the EU will ask for the higher level of redistribution of financial resources by means of the state budget 2 (within the framework of fulfilling all preconditions of the legislation of the EU) and increase in effectiveness of these resources centred on the improvement of competitiveness of economy. The contributions to the social funds paid to entrepreneurs that are willing to employ the unemployed persons should be covered from the public sources (from the unemployed fund and other contributions of state budget) in the same way as it is practised in the countries of the EU. The general decrease of 227 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia 1 The average wages in the Bratislava region, where the firms with highest productivity and also with highest ratio of added value are located, were in 2002 from 1.33 to 1.64 times higher than in other regions of Slovakia (in firms with number of employees higher than 20). 2 Analogously, the structural funds in the EU are the demonstration of higher redistribution of resources from the point of view of regions. ",
        "contributions into social funds would lower the rate of potential redistribution of resources into lagging behind regions and the marginal labour costs would be lowered completely unnecessarily as well there, where they are not justified. Under conditions of very low price of labour in Slovakia in comparison with high price of fixed capital, the price of which amount will first of all determine the numbers of new jobs, the tax credits should be orientated to the invested fixed capital. The development of labour costs can be influenced by setting the minimum wage at a particular level. The government maintains the minimum wage at very low level. On 1 October 2001, the minimum wage was set at the level of 4.920 SKK and on 1 October 2002 at 5.570 SKK. If in both years we compare the minimum wages valid to the date of 31 September and the 1 October with the average wage in both years (2001 and 2002), then from this comparison follows that in the year 2001 the minimum wage represented from 35.6 to 39.8% of average wage and in the year 2002 from 36.4 to 41.2% of average wage. If in July 2002 the subsistence level was set at the level of 3.930 SKK then the average level valid till the end of September 2002 stood only for 125.2% of the level of subsistence level and the minimum wage valid from the beginning of October onwards represented 141.7% of subsistence level. The absolute difference between minimum wage and subsistence level varied from 990 to 1.640 SKK (per month). From this comparison it follows that the \u2018opportunity costs\u2019 of free time of unemployed person who receives regular social benefits (and under condition that this unemployed person would take a job with minimum wage) ranged from 47 to 78 SKK (about from 1 to 2 EUR) for one working day. The opportunity costs determine the maximum level of marginal costs (the increased costs connected with travel costs and other items) of unemployed person connected with its employment. This comparison shows that if the government does not promote the policy of increasing minimum wage and if the difference between minimum wage and subsistence level does not increase, it is impossible to change the way of behaviour of unemployed persons in the labour market. The reservation wage is certainly higher than the set level of minimum wage. Surprisingly the way government envisages increasing the above mentioned difference casts doubt on the calculation of subsistence level and efforts to decrease it. The comparison of minimum wage and subsistence level confirms that it would be impossible to increase employment by short-time working, when the fixed costs connected with employment will not be compensated by sufficient level of income (wage). Generally the policy of increasing labour market flexibility has under conditions of extremely low labour costs its natural limits. This warning has been also brought about recently at the conference held in Bratislava (de Koning, 2003). In the strategy of supporting entrepreneurial activities and creation of new jobs are deficient the systems backing first of all the diffusion of technologies into SMEs. The support of employment can not be unilaterally accomplished by decreasing labour costs without creating further prerequisites for strengthening competitiveness of domestic industry that is always the base of employment and which will determine the wage level in the economy to which also the foreign investors will adjust. Social situation Statistically the real wages increased in 2002 by 5.8% in comparison to the previous year, but this happened firstly by postponing increase of prices of energies and water to the next year. In spite of this real increase in 2003 the real wages are still lower by about 1.5% than in 1998. 228 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The households with lower revenues were in 2002 more dependent on social benefits than in 1995. If in 1995 the social revenues of households beyond 1.5 multiple of subsistence level per person represented 33% and beyond double subsistence level about 27% of net financial receipts, in 2001 the ratio of these social revenues amounted to 52% and 41% respectively. The social situation is firstly influenced by high unemployment, i.e. a very high portion of citizens does not profit from the development of wages. In 2002 as much as 321 thousand of persons received social benefits. If the dependants are taken into account, then 618 thousand people live under the poverty level, which is about 11.5% of citizens. From the whole numbers of persons receiving social benefits, as much as 90.4% were unemployed persons. This shows also the low level of unemployment benefits. The poverty in Slovakia is generated by unemployment, not by the system of pensions (system of old age pensions, disability pensions and other schemes). If we compare the number of disbursed pensions in total 1199.3 thousand (of which 801 thousand were old age pensions), then only about 31 thousand of recipients of social benefits (with their dependants) generate the social systems outside of unemployment insurance. It is logical that 4% of contributions from the gross wages (3% paid by employers, 1% paid by employees) cannot suffice to cover the expenditures on passive and active labour market policies under 18% of rate of unemployment. As the representatives of EBRD pointed out, the low unemployment benefits (average unemployment benefit in 2002 reached 3.570 SKK, which is lower than the subsistence level \u2013 3.930 SKK from July 2002 forwards) do not enable unemployed persons to look for a job (Business Central Europe, 2001). On the contrary, from 2003 ahead the government introduced the measure of inspecting unemployed persons by presenting themselves at the labour offices two times in a month. This measure put at a disadvantage unemployed persons that look more intensively for jobs. The government focused this measure on decreasing black work, but the government has not introduced the sanctions of employers up till now if they do not pay taxes and social contributions. The pension system is fully in compliance with individual member states of the EU. The government prepares the reform of pension system with the high proportion of capitalisation pillar when as much as 10% of contributions from the gross wages should go to this pillar. The main reason for reform of pensions is the supposed ageing of the population and the decrease of birth rate. The introduction of capitalisation pillar into the pension system with high transformation costs are not accompanied by alternative solutions with intensified aid for the families with children. In the proposed contributions of 28% from gross wages the capitalisation system gathered as much as 35.7% (10 divided by 28). The proposal of government supposes also the decrease of contributions from the gross wages by half of percentage point, i.e. from the present 28.5 to 28% (in percentage the decrease should be 1.7 per cent, i.e. 28 divided by 28.5). This loss should be compensated by the profits (dividends) of pension funds in the capital markets. To the current operational costs of Social Insurance Company set by the law at the level of 3.5 percent of paid contributions to the pension fund will add up the costs of private pension funds. The experience from Poland and Hungary (Fulz, 2003) gives evidence of the risks of high introduction costs of capitalisation pillar into the pension systems, by which the long-term profitability cannot be at any case guaranteed by law to compensate at least for the inflation. 229 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "The capitalisation pillar of the pension system might endanger the state budget by the fact that the minimal age pensions should be guaranteed by the state budget, not by the three pillars of pension system altogether. The transformation of \u2018pay-as-you-go\u2019 pension system to capitalisation system in such a high degree in the country with the highest rate of unemployment in Europe, by suppressing the principle of solidarity would represent for the state budget an enormous burden in view of fulfilling EMU criteria. Above all under the framework of the third pillar, based on the optional personal savings, the government wants to render the tax credits. It is clear that the third pillar will be first of all exploited by the persons with higher income and these tax credits are not justified, when by this will indirectly be encumbered the state budget. Industrial relations Trade unions After the splitting up of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, the Confederation of Trade Unions of Slovakia (Konfederacia odborovych zvazov Slovenskej republiky, KOZ SR) became the largest trade union organisation in Slovakia, associating almost all sectoral/branch trade unions 3 . It associates more than 90% of all trade unionists in Slovakia, however the membership, particularly in the private sector has decreased. While the membership in 1993 was about 1.8 million, at present, the membership of trade unions is estimated at about 650 thousand, which represents approximately 35% density (situation in 2001). Trade unions used to be organised on the basis of industrial branches, rather than by occupation, although professional drivers, doctors and teachers are exceptions. The most relevant role of the KOZ SR is the co-ordination of the activities of sectoral/branch trade unions in negotiations with the government and employers representatives at the top-level of tripartite social dialogue. The KOZ SR represents its members also in international organisations like the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, European Trade Union Confederation, in the ILO Conferences, etc. The trade unions associated in the KOZ SR are organised on the basis of economic sectors or industrial branches. There are 37 member unions in the industry, service, private and public sectors. The ten biggest trade unions have more than 70% of trade unions which are KOZ SR members. Among the largest trade unions in Slovakia are the Metal trade union (OZ KOVO) with about 85,000 members, trade union of employees in education and science, more than 82,000, and Slovak trade union of employees in health care with almost 72, 000 members. The KOZ SR established regional county councils where the representatives of the most influential sectoral/branch trade unions of the given region are functioning 230 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 3 Apart from the KOZ SR, there are also some other trade union centres with a relatively small membership base, e.g. the Confederation of Art and Cultural Workers and the Independent Christian Trade Unions of Slovakia. ",
        "Employers\u2019 organisations The process of building up employers structures began later. Along with the process of so-called small and, especially, big privatisation the employers\u2019 organisations came into being. The majority of employers are associated in the Federation of Employers\u2019 Associations of Slovakia (Asociacia zamestnavatelskych zvazov a zdruzeni SR, AZZZ SR). The AZZZ SR is the representative of employers and it associates 37 various employers associations from the private, co-operative and public sectors. It was established in 1991 to create conditions for the dynamic development of entrepreneurship in Slovakia and for the protection and assertion of the common business and commercial interests of their members. Membership in AZZZ SR is voluntary. The AZZZ SR plays the most important role in co-ordination of the activities of employers associations in negotiations with other social partners at the tripartite social dialogue. It does represent its members also in several international organisations like Union of Industrial and Employers\u2019 Confederations of Europe, in ILO Conferences, etc. From the total number of legal business entities active in the Slovakia approximately 50% are AZZZ SR members. Among the largest and most influential employers associations in Slovakia associated in the AZZZ SR is the Slovak Council of Industrial Associations. In order to decentralise their activities the AZZZ SR has established their regional structures reflecting the regional administration division of Slovakia into eight counties. Tripartite concertation The state was previously the largest employer but its role in this position has been substantially reduced. Nevertheless the state is still a significant employer in the public sector, e.g. education and health care system, post and railways. The new role of the state manifests itself in industrial relations area where the state set the legal framework for the labour market and social policies, including collective bargaining. The main role of the state in social dialogue is in the tripartite negotiations with the representatives of employers and employees at the top level. For tripartite negotiations, the Council for Economic and Social Concertation (Rada hospodarskej a socialnej dohody, RHSD) was established more than 10 years ago. The RHSD handles most important economic and social issues of the governmental policy. It discusses and gives its opinions in the field of employment, labour relations, working conditions and other economic and social issues. The results of the tripartite concertation do not have legal validity however (as collective agreements do). Some conclusions of the tripartite concertations at the RHSD may, after approval by the parliament, serve as a starting point for sectoral/branch collective bargaining, e.g. setting the national minimum wage. The RHSD activities are regulated by legislative rule 4 . The participation of the employers\u2019 and trade unions\u2019 organisations in RHSD is ruled by their possibility to represent the social partner. Each organisation of employees and employers should be influential in the economy, i.e. to represent at least 10% of active population and be active at least in five regions of the country. Each party has seven representatives at the RHSD. The RHSD can establish also permanent and temporary ad hoc 231 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia 4 Act No. 106 on Economic and Social Partnership of 12 May 1999 now regulates the tripartite social dialogue in Slovakia. ",
        "working groups dealing with specific issues. Tripartite negotiations at the RHSD could result also in national General Agreements. Such General Agreements were concluded in each year from 1991 up to 1996. Due to principal disagreement of trade unions no General Agreements were signed for the years 1997-99. After a 3-year break, the parties again signed the General Agreement for 2000. This GA 2000 consisted of four main policy areas: economic, employment, income and social. (cid:2) Economic policy : There were tasks to improve the institutional and legal framework for running the private businesses more effectively, i.e. increasing companies\u2019 competitiveness, supporting SMEs, restructuring banking sector and the state monopolies, attracting foreign investments and reducing taxation burden. (cid:2) Employment policy : This was and still is the hottest issue because of very high unemployment rate. (cid:2) Income policy : The government promised, for example, to adopt measures supporting the real wage increase in the public and private sectors, not to apply the wage regulation in business sector, to adopt a new wage tariffs in civil and public services and to develop the taxation scheme. The employers\u2019 and the trade unions\u2019 representatives on sectoral/branch level promised to bargain for such a wage increase, which will avoid, at least, the negative impact of the inflation on the real wages. (cid:2) Social policy : The government promised, for example, to reform the social insurance system, including supplementary retirement insurance, and health care insurance. In spring 2001 the parties involved evaluated how were the agreed goals achieved and trade unions had several critical comments. Some goals were achieved (some reduction in the taxation burden), but some others (increasing the real wages or reducing the unemployment) were not met. Therefore the KOZ SR declared its dissatisfaction with fulfilling of the tasks of the government and refused to negotiate for the General Agreement for 2001, until the goals of GA 2000 are achieved. Parties involved in tripartite concertation at the RHSD have not yet agreed on the conclusion of a new tripartite General Agreement. Tripartite concertations are still going on regularly and several issues are discussed monthly. Among the most important achievements could be mentioned the approval of the new Labour Code and new Acts on Civil Service and Public Service in 2001. There are also some direct links between the outcomes of the top-level tripartite concertations and bipartite social dialogue i.e. collective bargaining. Collective bargaining Act No. 2 of 1991 on Collective Bargaining regulates collective bargaining. This Act appoints the partners for collective bargaining and also defines the respective procedures for collective bargaining. The exclusive right for collective bargaining is assigned to trade unions and employers representatives. If there is discord in collective bargaining, the respective social partners may ask the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family to assign a mediator or, if this conciliation is not successful, also a referee for the given dispute. At the same time, the Act defines the principles and procedures for declaring a strike by trade unions on the one hand, and the lockout rights of the employer in order to close down the plant or shop on the other hand. Collective bargaining in Slovakia is carried out on two levels: 232 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "(cid:2) sectoral/branch level, where the so-called higher level collective agreements (KZVS) are concluded between representatives of the appropriate employers\u2019 and trade unions\u2019 associations; and (cid:2) company or organisation level, where the collective agreements are concluded between local trade union organisations and the company management. This Act provides also that collective agreements regulate individual and collective labour relations between employer and employee and the rights and duties of the parties concerned. Collective agreements may improve upon the rights set out under the Labour Code, other laws or government decrees, but may not reduce them. There is a principle applied that the agreed conditions of employment and wages in higher level collective agreements (KZVS) are at a minimum or maximum standard, which must be respected in collective bargaining at the company (or plant) level. A company level collective agreement may not take away from employee rights agreed at a higher, sectoral/branch level, nor give more than granted by a higher level agreement if that one sets a maximum. The collective agreements concluded by a trade union are equally binding on employees who are not members. The validity of KZVS is subject to their registration at the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of Slovakia (the Ministry). The collective agreements are binding upon their signatories or upon members of signatory organisations. Their list should be attached to the collective agreement. Sectoral/branch level agreements may be extended to non-signatories in the same sector/branch by simple administrative procedure of the Ministry. Sectoral/branch level collective bargaining in Slovakia is widespread and according to estimations about 50% of all employees are covered by collective agreements. The available figures show that the number of collective agreements (KZVS) is quite stable. An outlook of the number of concluded KZVS registered by the Ministry is shown in Table 5. Table 5 Development of sectoral/branch collective agreements Year Number of agreements Number of supplements 1998 55 29 1999 23 37 2000 29 43 2001 30 43 2002 37 25 Source : Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, Annual reports on the social situation of the population of Slovakia. Collective agreements are usually focused on the following main topics: (cid:2) co-operation and communication between the trade union and management; (cid:2) wages and remuneration; (cid:2) employment and working conditions; (cid:2) health and safety at work; (cid:2) social issues; and (cid:2) settlement of the conflicts between the trade unions and the management. 233 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "Analysis of selected sectoral/branch collective agreements (contracted for the period 1999-2003) showed that the agreed provisions are often formulated in general and sometimes they regurgitate provisions of the Labour Code, reflecting the duties of the employers and employees. The wage and remuneration issues and the rules for managing mass dismissals were the prior issues in these collective agreements. Participation through trade unions The trade unions have the right to be informed and consulted on some issues. This is laid down in the Labour Code 5 and is applied, as a rule, priory to the dismissal of workers and significant organisational changes. According to valid Labour Code the employers should: (cid:2) Decide jointly with the trade union on the working time arrangement and about the creation and utilisation of the company Social Fund. 6 (cid:2) Consul t with the trade union on the terms of employment (especially these of women taking care of children and of young and disabled people), social policy issues, organisational changes substantially influencing the employers business activities, improvements in working conditions and health and safety and any other important measures. (cid:2) Inform the trade union about principal issues of employers business activities and about the achieved and expected economic results. (cid:2) Allow the trade unions to control the implementation of the labour legislation and the commitments included in the collective agreement. The trade union participation rights used to be extended in both the sectoral/branch collective agreements and company collective agreements over the above Labour Code standards. For example trade union representatives participate in decision-making on such issues as women\u2019s night work, setting the company holiday date and dismissal of a union delegate. Trade unions are very often provided information also about the labour cost and wage development, organisational changes and new and terminated employment contracts. Participation through works councils The recent weak point of social dialogue was that in many private SMEs no local trade unions have been established. Since 1 April 2002 when the new Labour Code was implemented, employees have the right to elect Works Councils. The Works Council is a body representing all employees of the firm if there is no trade union organisation. The Works Council may operate at firms employing at least 20 employees. In cases when the employer has less than 20 employees, but at least five employees, a shop steward shall operate. Works councils and shop stewards become operational on election grounds. The employer is obliged to secure election of the members of the works council to which all employees elect representatives of employees. The number of members of the Works Council depends on the number of employees and they are elected directly by secret ballot on the basis of 234 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries 5 Act No. 311 of 2001 on Labour Code, as amended. 6 Social fund is created according to Act No. 152 of 1994, as amended in amount of 0.6% of paid wages as a minimum. One of the most common areas where the Social Fund is used is subsidising the cost of meals provided for employees. ",
        "a list of candidates proposed by employees. Expenses arising from the elections are borne by the employer. The term of office of the Works Council and the shop steward is for a period of four years. The employer shall provide for time off from work with wage compensation, provide premises, maintain confidentiality and protect these employees. Currently new amendments to the Labour Code are under discussion and it is suggested that Works Councils operate also in organisations where trade unions are present. European works councils The new Labour Code includes also the rules for establishing the European Works Councils (EWC) in full line with the EU Regulation. Provisions concerning the EWCs will enter into force when Slovakia becomes an EU Member State. Nevertheless some EU multinationals operating in the country (e.g. Volkswagen) provide the opportunity for their employee representatives to participate at their EWCs. Dispute settlement Act No. 2 of 1991 lays down also how a collective dispute can arise and provides for a procedure to follow. The mediation takes place only if the parties desire it, and aims to bring both parties to an agreement. If the parties fail to agree on a mediator, either party may apply to the Ministry for one to be appointed from a list kept by the Ministry. The two parties carry the mediator\u2019s costs and remuneration equally. Mediation is deemed to have failed unless the dispute is settled within 30 days of hearing the details. If mediation has failed, the parties may agree to refer the dispute to arbitration. An arbitrator may be appointed by the Ministry at the request of one party when the dispute concerns interpretation of an existing agreement, or concluding a collective agreement where strike action is forbidden due to the nature of the work. Arbitrators may only be appointed by the Ministry from the Ministry list, and cannot be the same persons as the mediators. Because there is no system of separate Labour Courts in Slovakia, either party may appeal within 15 days from the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on a point of law to the county court for the party most affected by the ruling. The situation in the settlement of collective disputes by mediation during the last five years is highlighted in Table 6. Table 6 Mediation cases and their results Years Total number of the cases Successfully concluded 1998 46 29 1999 31 21 2000 29 23 2001 27 19 2002 25 13 Source : Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, Annual reports on the social situation of the population of Slovakia. Industrial action The Collective Bargaining Act No. 2 of 1991 as amended regulates also strike action and the settlement of collective disputes. The law implies a \u2018peace clause\u2019 into collective agreements, i.e. 235 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "the strike action concerning the contents of an agreement is banned during its life. A collective dispute has to be concerned with the conclusion of a collective agreement or fulfilment of commitments under such an agreement. A dispute of rights under an existing agreement and a dispute of interest or a claim to a new agreement have to go to mediation and if necessary to arbitration procedure. A strike is expressly referred to in the law as an extreme measure to which recourse is to be made only after the other possibilities have been exhausted in the process of a dispute over conclusion of a collective agreement. Sympathy disputes may be illegal if the employer affected cannot influence the course or outcome of the principal dispute. The decision about the strike has to be declared by the respective trade union organisation upon the results of the secret voting and majority votes are needed. The employer is not allowed to replace employees on strike by recruiting other employees. Trade union representatives must allow access to the workplace and departure from it to employees wishing to work. Employees may not be forced to participate in the strike, nor prevented from so doing. The trade union must collaborate with the employer to prevent harm to the equipment or processes. Strikes are banned at times of emergency or disaster and in certain occupations. The employer\u2019s side may go to the relevant regional court in case to seek a ruling that the strike is illegal. There is no right to pay during the strike period. Employees wishing to work, but unable to do so due to the strike, are entitled to their normal pay. The law allows an employer to lockout his business unit as an extreme measure during the process of negotiating collective agreement. Employees affected by a legal lockout are entitled to be paid at half of their normal rate. Participation in a strike, which has been ruled illegal, is treated as unauthorised absence. Individual employees are not liable for any loss caused simply by the interruption of work due to strike action. However the trade union may be liable for damages sustained as a result of a strike declared illegal. After keeping the social peace for more than 10 years, the first strike in the history of the independent Slovak Republic has taken place recently. The trade unions for railway workers went for strike at the beginning of 2003. The first strike started on 29 January at 03.00 o\u2019clock morning and lasted for six hours. After the further unsuccessful negotiations between the trade unions, management of the rails and the representatives of the government the second strike started on 31 January night and lasted until 3 February evening, when the trade unions decided to interrupt it because the court considered their strike as illegal in terms of the Act on Collective Bargaining. The trade unions disagreed with this decision, arguing with rights of strike laid down by the European Social Charter adopted by Slovakia and made an appeal for the higher court. Both sides are still waiting for the result. According to the trade unions representatives, the main reason for their decision was the failed negotiations with the management of the Slovak railway companies and later on with the Minister of transport, post and telecommunications on postponing the implementation of reduction of railways services for the public transport planned since 1 February 2003. In several regions the railway was the main public transport means for school attendees and for workers. The aim of the Slovak railway company management of the proposed measure was to reduce the operating cost 236 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "of the railways by about SKK 650 million per year. Two strikes lasted 74 hours in total and resulted in reasonable economic losses of the railways, preliminarily estimated at more than SKK 60 million. Although the trade unions participating in the strike did not achieve their original goals and the proposed reductions in railway lines were implemented in practice, the trade union representatives considered the strike as successful (e.g. the railway trade unions have successfully checked their capacity to mobilise their members for strike, and their experience could encourage also other unions). Other social dialogue issues After an optimistic re-start in 1999 tripartism has run into trouble again during 2001 when the outcomes of the General Agreement for 2000 were evaluated. First of all two socially sensitive goals - increasing the real wages and reduction of high unemployment were not achieved. In the meantime several tasks of the government were already accomplished (e.g. average real wages increased in 2001 and 2002 too, real wages in public sector increased in 2002). At the same time, though several employment policy measures were implemented, the unemployment rate was barely reduced. Although tripartite negotiations at the RHSD continue there are often disagreements between the parties involved (e.g. the trade unions disagree with proposed changes in social policy and in labour legislation, including social dialogue too). Trade unions representatives are still keeping the declaration of state of crisis and are not interested in negotiations for the new General Agreement for 2003 (recently trade unions declared their readiness for strike too). Representatives of employers and the government also did not show a special interest to start with the negotiations for a new social pact. As a result of this, a new General Agreement, as one of the main outputs of tripartism, has not been signed in the country for three years. Currently the trade unions have objections to the proposed minimum wage level and to the reform of the pension insurance system. Such outcomes question the effectiveness of the recent tripartite social dialogue at national level. Current relations between the trade unions and the government and employers are generally more conflicting than before. According to Act No. 387 of 1996 on Employment the National Labour Office was established; this body acts through its tripartite self-governing bodies like the Supervisory Board and Governing Committees of Regional and District Labour Offices. Members of self-governing bodies are elected for four-year terms of office and represent all three social partners. The Supervisory Board consists of nine members, representing equally employees, employers and the state. It is elected and recalled by the National Council of Slovakia, based on proposals submitted by the representative organisation of social partners. Tripartite self-governing bodies are dealing, for example, with approval of projects for implementation of measures of active labour market policy in respective regions including decisions on allocation of necessary financial resources. Currently some attempts to change this mechanism of application of tripartism and strengthen the role of the state administration have been taken. In 1998 the development of regional social dialogue started in newly constituted regional state administration bodies. Later on, County Councils for Economic and Social Concertation in four of 237 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "the eight counties were established. The Phare project aimed to support the development of regional social dialogue in Slovakia was implemented in these four counties in 1998-1999. The results of this project were evaluated by the social partners very positively and contributed to an excellent start for tripartite RHSDs in these four regions. But later on representatives of the regional state administration and partly of the employers\u2019 organisations did not engage a lot in the development of regional social dialogue. Activities of established regional RHSDs were mostly formal and did not translate into real involvement of regional social partners in dealing with actual problems in regions. The National Plan for Regional Development adopted in 2001 increased the role of social partners in regional development. They should participate in the preparation of Regional Development Plans and projects seeking EU financial support. In late 2001 the regional self-government bodies were elected for the first time. These took over responsibility for regional development. It is expected that both events would impact positively on the development of regional social dialogue in Slovakia. 238 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

        "The delegates of trade unions, employers associations and representatives of economic research who represented Slovakia at the tripartite workshop organised by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Vienna on 26-28 May 2003, agreed on the choice of National Development Plan for the social partners in Slovakia relating to meeting the criteria for the entry of the country to the EMU. Slovakia was the only country from all participating candidate countries at the tripartite workshops to have no government representatives present. Therefore, if the development project is to be beneficial to Slovakia, the representatives of the government from the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family should identify themselves with this project as quickly as possible in order that in autumn 2003 the national seminar on further advancement of elaborating and successive realisation of the development project could be organised (according to the intentions of the Foundation). The social partners, the participants of the workshop in Vienna, are according to the natural logic of tripartite bargaining prepared, in good time before the national seminar organised in autumn 2003, to discuss this National Development Plan with the representatives of government, who up till now have not expressed their opinion. Moreover, they are prepared to amend the content of the project, and, if necessary, by mutual accord, to accept a completely new project, one acceptable to all social partners. The participants of the seminar are fully aware of the importance of such a project for both the future development of industrial relations and the socio-economic development in Slovakia, particularly during the difficult period of fulfilling Maastricht criteria for entry to EMU. The National Development Plan of the social partners centred on decreasing unemployment in Slovakia and can be summarised as follows: Why focus on solving unemployment? The choice of the content of the development project was influenced by the fact that long-term unemployment in the Slovak Republic is among the highest in candidate countries. An urgent situation of solving unemployment follows from both the existing development of the unemployment rate and the policies that have been used by all governments to decrease it. The government that came to power after the general elections in 1998 set in its programme declaration the target to lower the unemployment rate to under 11 per cent. During its election term the government decided that each governmental decision influencing the economy should impact on unemployment. In spite of this effort, to the end of its term in autumn 2002, the government was not successful in decreasing unemployment, but on the contrary, the unemployment rate increased to the level of 18.7% (according to the Labour Force Surveys). After 1999 the government prepared legislative measures to oblige unemployed persons to be registered at the labour offices. This rigorousness of conditions increased in the next years, which manifested itself in the development of registered unemployed persons and in the rate of unemployment. The comparison of rates of unemployment based on Labour Force Surveys and registered unemployed persons is included in the following table. Annex 1 National Development Plan: Towards EMU through solving unemployment 240 ",

Source : Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic; National Labour Office of the Slovak Republic; and authors\u2019 calculations. If the rate of unemployment based on registered unemployed persons up to 2000 was higher than the rate of unemployment according to the Labour Force Surveys, the rigorousness of conditions for being registered has caused a reversal in the situation from the fourth quarter of 2000. Slovakia needs the rigorousness of policies influencing unemployment, however firstly the country needs real employment growth, new jobs. In the future the evaluation of employment policies should not be based on administrative measures, but should be consistent with the Lisbon Summit criteria. Slovakia should in the long- and middle- term (until 2010) channel to employment the economic activity of people in productive age to the level of 70 per cent. As it is evident, the National Development Plan of the social partners in Slovakia has to include also the agreement of social partners about targets of socio-economic development and methods for its evaluation. What to develop? At present the social dialogue is not working, because of diametrically different requirements of social partners. At the moment the problem of minimum wage brings conflict first of all between government and trade unions. This problem recurs each year when the minimum wage should be increased because of inflation. On the one hand the government tries to put through the low minimum wage, as one of the measures that should promote the creation of new jobs, on the other hand the trade unions ask for higher wages, which should be sufficiently motivating for the entry into the labour market, for the performance of workers and for the dignified life of employed persons. Under the framework of the National Development Plan, a comprehensive list of measures should be elaborated that would be centred on support to new jobs creation. The project should incorporate both the measures of active labour policy, and provision of financial and budgetary stability as the preconditions for the next stages of the project aimed at increasing employment. Because the government plans to reform the pension system, which should be linked to the performance of workers, this reform should also become the part of the project. A wide rather than narrow approach to the factors influencing employment creation should be selected. When to develop? The project should start in autumn 2003 and last till the end of the election term of this government, i.e. till September 2006 when the new general elections take place. From the point of view of content, it will probably be very difficult to elaborate a project that would be prepared for the period from 2003 till the time of entry of Slovakia into the EMU. Where to develop? Taking into account the intricacy and the strategic character of decisions which will lead to a higher employment, the National Development Plan should be concentrated at the highest tripartite level, i.e. at The Council for Economic and Social Concertation (RHSD). 241 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovakia ",
        "The main objective of the project (continual social dialogue on the measures of the government aimed at increasing employment) should not be confused with the measures of the government aimed at decreasing unemployment and/or increasing employment (instrumental in fulfilling the main objective of the project). Both objectives, i.e. main objective (social dialogue) and instrumental objective (preparing set of measures) are in the project inseparable from each other. The instrumental objective would be fulfilled by preparing set of measures targeted at increasing jobs in the Slovak economy by the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, Ministry of Finance, National Labour Office and Counties (8 higher regional units) and by bringing them into effect after being discussed at the RHSD. Apart from the strategic decisions (included in the National Development Plan) which should be decided at the highest tripartite level (at RHSD), they should be supplemented and supported by the partial development projects at sectoral levels (Sectoral Development Projects). The choice of sectors would be carried out according to the proposals by the social partners and according to the decisions at the Council for Economic and Social Concertation (RHSD). It is clear that first of all the trade unions will need the support both at the highest and sectoral levels from the independent organisations and external experts (research institutes, universities, etc.). During the whole pre-accession period to the EMU the preconditions for social dialogue should be created. The confidence of the social partners during the project should be based on knowing mutually the long-term objectives of all social partners under the conditions of fulfilling EMU criteria. The first step of the project would be the creation of a list of preferences of social partners that would create also the first part of the development project records. Who is responsible? All social partners should participate in the preparation of the National Development Plan and, via the Council for Economic and Social Concertation (RHSD), should also be responsible for the implementation of the project. Which financial resources are needed to cover the project? The government should earmark the financial resources from the state budget for this project. Apart from this, the project could be co-financed by additional resources from the EU (structural funds). 242 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Miroslav Stanojevic, University of Ljubljana Political situation At the end of the 1980s the major political groupings in Slovenia were the right-wing coalition, the Demos; the Slovenian Liberal Democrats (LDS), a mixture of market reformers and influential groups strongly oriented towards a model of social market economy; and the Associated List of Social Democrats (ZLSD), the reform-oriented former communist party on the left. The right-wing coalition won a majority in the first free parliamentary elections and formed the government. Being internally extremely heterogeneous and integrated by anti-communist stance, the coalition soon after the disintegration of communism faced problems. Controversies within the coalition caused new, second elections held in 1992. In this election, Liberal Democrats won a relative majority and formed a wide coalition with reformed communists and some right-wing parties. Since then the strongest political party in Slovenia has been the Liberal Democrats. The party was returned to power after a third election in 1996, this time in coalition with the more conservative Peoples Party (LS). The coalition disintegrated in the spring of 2000 when a new, transitional right-wing coalition took power for a few months. After the fourth election in October 2000 the Liberal Democrats returned to power and formed a new wide coalition with reformed communists and Peoples Party. Compared to the other \u2018transitional\u2019 societies the first decade of the Slovenian \u2018post-communism\u2019 was marked by a relative prevalence of the left-centre party (the Liberal Democrats \u2013 LDS), pragmatically assisted by smaller left and right-wing parties. In other transformational societies the left-centre and right-centre governments have frequently interchanged each other in power. At political level it was the most important peculiarity of the Slovenian transition. Economic performance Transformational depression In common with other \u2018transitional\u2019 societies, Slovenia was faced with transformational depression at the end of the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s. Figures reveal a negative annual rate of GDP growth between 1988 and 1992 with the lowest point reached in the 1992. Compared to the other \u2018transitional\u2019 countries the depression in Slovenia was among less intensive. Economic growth After 1994 the trends changed significantly. Thereafter the Slovenian economy has experienced growth rates of between 3 and 5%, exceeding the EU average. The Slovenian per capita GDP is 10,000 USD, close to the per capita GDP of some less developed EU members. According to this measure, Slovenia is the most developed country in transition, reaching 70% of the EU average. Assuming 1% growth, GDP per head in Slovenia relative to the EU average should reach the EU average around year 2010. Under the same condition the convergence in all other \u2018transitional\u2019 societies will take much longer periods. Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia 10 243 ",
        "Inflation At the end of the 1980s the inflation rate in former Yugoslavia was extremely high. The highest rate (1,300%) was recorded in 1989. After introducing the Slovenian national currency in 1991, the rate was radically reduced to the level of 117,7%. Inflation grew in the year 1992 to 200% but thereafter it was successfully reduced, falling to below 10% after 1995. In 2001 the inflation rate was 8.4%. (Slovenian economic mirror 1/2002) Figure 1 Real growth rates of GDP Source: Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia Unemployment Unemployment rate, measured by the ILO survey standards, reached the highest level of 9% in 1993 and 1994, later being stabilised below the EU average. In 2001 the unemployment rate was 6.4%. In comparative terms unemployment is not a huge problem in Slovenia in this moment. Wages and salaries Wages and salaries grew highest in 1993 when real gross payment per person increased by 11.7%. After that the increases were around 5% per year, being below the productivity growth after 1996 (up to 2001). In 2001 real gross payment surpassed the productivity growth again, this time because of the increases of payments in public sector. Compared to the other \u2018transitional\u2019 countries Slovenian employees have been quite well paid during the last decade. Slovenia is certainly not a low wage economy. General government deficit and public debt In the first half of the last decade Slovenia had a general government surplus, with the exceptional 1994 when deficit of \u20130.2% appeared. After the year 1997 deficit was around \u20131% per year. In the 90s the total public debt never exceeded one third of GDP (it was 21.0% in 1993 and 27.1% in 2001). (Source: Bilten javnih financ, IMAD). Real interest rates At the end of the decade the interest rates were essentially lower than at the beginning of the 90s, but still remaining at a relatively high level (from about 20% in year 1992 to 6% in year 2001). Exchange rate In 1991 Slovenia introduced its own currency. During the last decade the managed exchange rate\u2019s float was among the monetary policy\u2019s most important regulative mechanism. 244 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries -12 -14 -10 -8 -6 -4 -202468 BDP 1989 1988 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 ",
        "Accommodation to the Maastricht criteria The presented data suggest that the Slovenian economic development was relatively successful in the 90s. The success was based on a very specific development pattern, which primarily integrated and mobilised internal Slovenian national resources. The key conditions of the pattern were: firstly, the Slovenian formation into the nation state for the first time in its history; secondly, specific class constellations enabling a decade long continuity of the left-centre governments; thirdly, relatively privileged developmental starting-point. Although the pattern was not explicitly formulated at the beginning of the transitional period, it early manifested some characteristics indicating its strong deviation from the patterns applied in other transitional countries. The Slovenian transition was characterised by gradual institutional transformation of the national economy, being combined by strong activation of a quite generous social policies. Contrary to the pattern of fast and radical departure from \u2018communism\u2019 which was based on radical coupon privatisation, strong inflow of foreign direct investment, liberalisation of capital flows and financial markets and restriction of social transfers and services (Phillips, Ferfila, 2000: 3), the Slovenian pattern contained privatisation which accentuated internal buy-outs and in accordance with that feature it limited inflow of foreign direct investments and focused on internal resources; it liberalised capital flow and financial markets very slowly; it stimulated social services and transfers more than reduced. Among the most important factors of a relatively successful stabilisation and economic development in Slovenia was the monetary policy. At the beginning of the 90s it was focused on inflation reduction by controlling the money supply. Up to the mid 90s instruments and goals of monetary policy were fully developed and refined. The policy of managed exchange rate flow was exceptionally important for small Slovenian economy and its stability. Within the strongly socially oriented system the monetary policy could not be fully activated as an instrument of anti- inflationary income policy. Unemployment as a side effect of a more radical monetary policy was socially and politically unacceptable. This limitation opened the room for social dialogue and its institutionalisation at macro level (Philips, Ferfila, 2000: 7). In the second half of the 90s the monetary policy was preoccupied with achieving the Maastricht\u2019s convergence criteria. These include: i. low inflation; ii. low budget deficit (-60 % of GDP); iii. debt/GDP ratio (-3%); iv. low interest rate; v. fixed exchange rate (without devaluation) (Kauppinen, 1998: 10). In the second half of the 90s the Slovenian monetary policy was focused on the reduction of the inflation rate up to the EU level. It was recognised as a key condition of a soft transition from the managed float regime to fixed exchange rate. In terms of the Maastricht criteria the relatively high inflation rate (8.4 % in 2001) is still the main Slovenian problem. Generally speaking, Slovenia complies to fiscal criteria (general government 245 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia ",
        "deficit and public debt), but does not meet monetary criteria (inflation, interest rate and foreign exchange rate) (see: Lavrac V. and Lavrac I.: Slovenia and Maastricht Convergence Criteria, IMAD Working paper, 12/1996, in: Slovenian Economic Mirror 6/98, IMAD). In Slovenia the accession process was strongly accelerated after the signing of the accession agreement in 1999. The room for manoeuvre of its national regulation policies has been reduced in that process. Part of the reduction is abandonment of the relatively successful monetary policy: accommodation to the Maastricht criteria, being supported by the national monetary policy, means abolishment of that policy. The result of these changes will be more direct and more intensive dependence of growth on \u2018exogenous foreign demand beyond the control or influence of Slovenia\u2019 (Philips, Ferfila, 2000: 15). A national environment could react at a possible recession by changes in employment levels and/or by wage and price growth limitation. In other words, accommodation to the EMU system implies restrictions which confront employees\u2019 interests. Within the (accommodation to) the EMU workers are exposed to direct market pressures more than before (Knudsen, 1998: 44). The pressures could provoke resistance; the employees\u2019 reactions could block and/or hinder the changes of this type. That is why the employees\u2019 interest organisations are becoming a key factor of national internal regulative and legitimisation processes. Examples of the actual EMU members show that political exchanges between the social partners were the most important form of their adaptation to the EMU regime. In exchange for wage flexibility (or for more moderate demands for nominal wages growth), the trade unions reached guarantees concerning wage and price stability and \u2018substitutions\u2019 in form of employment growth and pension funds (Knudsen, 1998: 46). Generally speaking, the EU national collective bargaining systems in the 90s manifested elements of the \u2018beggar-my-neighbour\u2019 approach, being primarily focused on reduction of the wage growth. At aggregate level this type of wage dumping reflected in wage increases of only 1-3 % per year in the 90s. (Kauppinen, 1998: 35), compared to increases of 5% and more in the 70s and 80s. According to the analysed cases of accommodation to the EMU regime, the regime is a frame which accentuates the importance of the national industrial relations systems, collective bargaining and income policies. The EMU promote them into the key national regulatory mechanisms and, in case of recession, into the \u2018shock absorbers\u2019, which should secure the balance within the national economy ( The impact of EMU on Industrial Relations in European Union, 1998). Industrial relations The Slovenian industrial relations system is congruent with the described political and economical peculiarities. We will focus on development of that system in the 90s and its actual basic characteristics, especially on: (cid:2) strikes in the 90s; (cid:2) structure of the trade union scene in Slovenia; (cid:2) employers\u2019 organisations; (cid:2) basic features of the social dialogue; (cid:2) main characteristics of the Slovenian labour market. 246 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "In the concluding part of the report, according to the identified characteristics of the Slovenian industrial relations system, the possible type of reactions to the EMU context will be presented. Industrial conflicts Strike wave 1985-1997 In Slovenia strike frequencies sharply grew in the second half of the 80s, being high at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s. In the year 1992 the wave reached its peak. In that year the frequencies were still high and average participation in strikes was highest in the twenty year-long period (probably the highest in the whole history of labour movement in Slovenia). According to the average participation of 372 striking workers these industrial actions were large, massive industrial actions in comparative terms, too. (see: Edwards and Hyman, 1995). Number of working days lost per 1000 employees was extremely high in that year being almost 40 times higher than in 2000. Immediately after 1992 the strike wave declined; it recovered in the period 1996-1997 and almost vanished at the end of the 90s. Figure 2 The strike wave 1985-1999 Causes of strikes and distribution between the sectors Basic causes of strikes in Slovenian companies are \u2018wage-related\u2019. Analysis of the grievances of those involved in strike situations during the 1994-1997 period reveals that 84% of all strikes in that period were caused by dissatisfaction with wages. In two thirds of all cases workers went on strike because of late payment of wages, when payment was delayed for one month (30.2%), two months (19.9%) and even more (12.8%) (Poro \u00e3 ilo o delu ZSSS, 129). In the 90s strike density was highest in labour-intensive sectors, where the companies more often experienced huge business-related problems. In the period 1994-1997 the absolute number of strikes was highest in the metal and electrical equipment industry (188), then in textile and leather (103), construction (48) and wood-based industry (41) (Poro \u00e3 ilo o delu ZSSS, 1998: 124). Conflicts in the service sector In the second half of the 90s when the strike rate in manufacturing industry was declining, strike activity in the service sector started to escalate. 247 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia strikes participants days lost 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 ",
        "Strikes organised by the doctors\u2019 trade union, FIDES, was a watershed of strike activities in the service sector. After that strike, revealing the doctors\u2019 union FIDES as a highly militant interest organisation, different groups of employees in the service sector went on strike (schoolteachers and employees in kindergartens, civil servants, judges from district courts, employees from universities and research institutions, railway workers, employees in air traffic control etc.) During the second half of the last decade the most powerful interest groups in the public sector promoted themselves into the wage-setters in Slovenia. The doctors\u2019 pressures have caused huge problems and controversies between different interest groups in the public sector and between employees in the public and private sector. It is the main problem of social dialogue in Slovenia in this moment: the growing differences between payments in the private and public sector, causing (potentially) problems in income policies and pressuring the private sector (already exposed to the pressures on the international markets). Social partners Trade unions Compared to the early 90s, when ideological and political splits within the Slovenian trade unions scene manifested similarly in structure as its counterparts in most transitional Eastern European societies (MacShane, 1994: 337.367), from the end of the 90s above mentioned ideologically more neutral new cleavages (based on diverging interests of employees in manufacturing industry and public sector) have been more accentuated. There are six trade union confederations in Slovenia: the Free TU (ZSSS), the Independent TU (KNSS), the PERGAM, the Confederation 90 (K-90), Alternative and Solidarity. The first four confederations were formed at the beginning of the 90s. The last two are relatively new being formed almost ten years later. The biggest one is the \u2018old reformed\u2019 ZSSS, which includes approximately a half of the trade unionised workforce. Besides the confederations there are 17 autonomous professional and sector trade unions. Most of them are concentrated in the public service sector of the economy. In the first half of the 90s approximately 60% of the Slovenian workforce were members of trade unions. In the second half of the same decade trade unions lost almost one third of their membership. The density rate had fallen to 42.8% of the workforce in year 1998 and kept the same level (41.3%) in the year 2000. Within the trend of declining membership the \u2018old reformed\u2019 ZSSS preserved its leading position, with more than 50% of all union members throughout the 10-year period. In the second half of the 90s the growth of new unionism mostly within the service sector of the economy appeared. These were the only \u2018winners\u2019 of the past decade as, not only their share of total union membership rose, but they also did not lose their own membership. Generally speaking, all these smaller unions account for almost 40% of total trade union membership. Two phenomena characterised the Slovenian union scene - the concentration of membership in ZSSS on the one hand and the fragmentation into new professional and sector unions on the other (Stanojevic, 2000). 248 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

In the 90s trade unions lost most members from the non-worker, better educated employees and middle and higher management groups, where there was no pressure from unemployment, but also from marginal workers who were under extreme pressure. The core labour groups (those with vocational schooling, machine operators) who were under severe pressure from unemployment remained union members or were leaving unions less intensively than the other groups. From general organisations which in the 80s had unselectively represented all \u2018working people\u2019, Slovenian trade unions have definitely changed into organisations representing workers in the 90s. (Stanojevic, 2000) Employer associations There are four employers organisations in Slovenia: (cid:2) The Slovenian Chamber of Commerce; (cid:2) Chamber of Crafts; (cid:2) Slovenian Employers Association; (cid:2) Slovenian Association of Crafts. The most influential employers organisation is the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce (Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije). The chamber is based on obligatory membership and has functioned as the key employers interests articulator within the collective bargaining system from the beginning of the 90s. In the second half of the 90s it was gradually substituted by a new employers\u2019 association. The chamber is not an exclusive employers representation, but it is still the most important player on the employers side within the collective bargaining system. The chamber consists of 26 branch and 13 territorial organisations including about 50,000 firms. Interests of small enterprises and independent crafts have been articulated by the Chamber of Crafts (Obrtna zbornica Slovenije). It represents 60,000 small enterprises. The majority of these 249 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia 42.8 48.8 58.6 69 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1989 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 ",
        "enterprises \u2013 two thirds \u2013 consists of micro, one-man, self-employed workforce. The chamber consists of 62 regional chambers and numerous sections. At the beginning of 1994 the Slovenian Employers Association was formed (Zdru \u00cf enje delodajalcev Slovenije). Compared to the Chamber of Commerce, the Association is a voluntary one. It includes 1628 companies covering 60 per cent of employees in manufacturing industry. The association is organised in 12 sections able to coordinate activities within the branch collective bargaining process. In co-operation with chambers it improved employers representation and bargaining position within the collective bargaining system on both, macro and mezzo levels. The formation of the Association was triggered by demands of ILO and other international organisations. From the 1999 it has been an observatory member of UNICE and has cooperated with European employers associations. Immediately after the formation of the Slovenian Employers Association, a new interest representation of small companies (Zdru \u00cf enje delodajalcev obrtnih dejavnosti) was formed. This association has 4000 members representing, in terms of workforce, the majority of small employers. It is organised in 13 territorial organisations. The four organisations described partly overlapped. All members of the Employers Association are also obligatory members of the Chamber of Commerce. Similar overlap appears in the case of small employers. For once, all the above mentioned organisations are legitimate employers representatives and all of them are included in collective bargaining procedure. It is expected that a new act on collective bargaining, which is currently in parliamentary procedure, will remove the employers\u2019 representation in collective bargaining to the new voluntary organisations. (Stanojevic, M., Rajgelj, B. and Poto \u00e3 nik, M., 2001) Social dialogue The political exchanges The year 1992 was a watershade in Slovenia\u2019s \u2018post-communist\u2019 development. Transformational depression reached the bottom in that year. It was shown that a powerful strike wave connected the late \u2018communism\u2019 and early \u2018post-communism\u2019 in Slovenia. During the last decade the wave reached its peak in 1992. Exactly in that year, when the depression was deepest and the strike wave highest, the electoral body moved towards the left-centre. Liberal democrats (LDS) took the leading role in Slovenia. From year 1992 the political exchanges between (left-centre) governments and organised economic interests are a permanent feature of the Slovenian transition. From that year the exchanges are a key mode of interest concertation, enabling adjustments of the market reforms to their social acceptability. During the last decade the two relatively clearly differentiated periods of the political exchanges could be identified. Within the first period (up to the 1994) the political exchanges were highly pragmatic and weakly institutionalised. In that period the political elite was involved in intensive, explicit as well as implicit, dialogue with clearly expressed social discontent of the core worker population. 250 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The key steps of that first political exchanges\u2019 period were: i. activation of massive social transfers at the beginning of the \u2018transition\u2019; ii. law on privatisation from 1992; iii. radical wage and salary increase in 1993; iv. law on participation from 1993. The political exchanges, being used also by first more right-wing \u2018post-communist\u2019 government, started with massive social transfers, mostly in forms of mass early retirement, later being combined and substituted by a wide definition of the unemployment status. Within this type of pragmatic exchanges also exceptional improvement of gross payments in 1993, which followed an extreme wage decrease in previous years, could be classified. All these exchanges were primarily focused on prevention and lowering of the social tensions, simultaneously securing the political support to the government. The first strategic, symbolically most important political exchange between workers and the political elite was the Law on privatisation. The law was adopted in the \u2018critical\u2019 1992. Strongly accentuating internal buy-outs in labour intensive sectors of the economy, the law literally promoted striking workers into the relevant co-owners of their companies. The immediate \u2018anti-strike\u2019 effect of the law, combined by the above mentioned wage increase in 1993, was significant. Indirect result of that first strategic exchange was less visible and more important: combined with other pragmatic political exchanges, the law on privatisation laid the foundations of the Slovenian transitional pattern. It triggered transformation of the strike wave into the industrial relations system, which was, atypically for other transitional societies, strongly accommodated to the employees\u2019 interests. The result of these early, mostly pragmatic dialogues with worker discontent was strategic. The \u2018transition\u2019 into the socially acceptable type of capitalism started. The second period of the political exchanges started in 1994 when the Economic and Social Council (ESC) was founded. After that the political exchanges got a form of more institutionally regulated tripartite dialogue. The ESC was established by the first tripartite agreement on wages in the private sector. The negotiations on the informal tripartite level started already in 1992, but the social partners were not yet ready to reach a broader consensus on topics like employment policies, social security, tax reforms etc, which have been included in the draft agreement. ESC is made up of 15 members, five each from the government, trade unions and employers. The first broad social agreement was signed in 1995, and another followed in 1996. The agreements reconfirmed collective bargaining system as an exclusive and basic instrument of both the formation and the implementation of incomes policies and all the obligations and rights coming out from labour relations. Since then the parliament has also demanded that all the acts pertaining to the interests of the social partners have to be accompanied by the opinion of the tripartite body before entering the parliamentary procedure. In Slovenia the social agreements covers all the important social and economic areas such as social policy, health and safety at work, employment and unemployment, competitiveness etc., but still 251 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia ",
        "the income policies remain the central issue. In the case when the partners could not reach a broader social agreement they normally at least agreed on the wage policy agreement. There were no formal agreements reached for 1997 and 1998 despite the very long discussion on the draft social agreement. At the end the government defined the wage policies by low, but even then considered the discussion with the social partners. From 1994 up to June 2002 all together two broader social tripartite agreements and five tripartite agreements on incomes policies were adopted in Slovenia. The last one was signed in June 2002 (for 2002-2004) as part of the proposed broader social agreement for the period 2002-2005 which is still being discussed by the social partners. Within the ESC the partners regularly discuss proposals of all the new labour and other legislation concerning the interests of social partners. The proposal of a new Labour Code, which will be in force from January 2003, has been exposed to a long debate. The proposal of new laws on collective bargaining and other systemic laws are regularly on the agenda of the ESC. (The discussion about the new pension system absorbed a lot of the energies of the councillors, too. This topic was on the Council\u2019s agenda under the pressure of a deep pension fund crisis caused by mass early retirements at the beginning of the 90s.) Collective bargaining Compared to the other transitional societies a highly centralised collective bargaining system is one of the most significant features of the Slovenian industrial relations system. The normative frame of collective bargaining system was defined by the basic labour code from 1989. Within this frame, at the beginning of the transitional period, the dominant bargaining level was fixed at macro level. Under the key parameters of income policies defined by government at this time, the new social players started to negotiate collective agreements. The unions were in great transformation, overloaded with internal conflicts. The substitution for employers association was found in the Chamber of Commerce. The actual structure of collective agreements is as follows: 1. Two general collective agreements (for private and public sector); 2. Branch collective agreements and 3. Company collective agreements. The two general collective agreements are the result of the dialogue at national level conducted by the main trade union confederations, the national employers associations and the government for the public sector. The branch/sector agreements are negotiated by branch trade union organisations and corresponding employers\u2019 associations. With the exception of company collective agreements, all others are valid under the condition of registration at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Thirty-eight branch collective agreements have been registered at the Ministry. Every year amendments (usually not very frequent) to these agreements are also registered. The collective bargaining system in Slovenia is highly inclusive. Almost all of the total labour force is \u2018covered\u2019 by the provisions of collective agreements, at least with lowest standards defined in the 252 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "general agreements. The usual explanation is the role of the Chamber of Commerce in the bargaining system. Being obligatory members of the Chamber, Slovenian companies are obliged to respect the agreements signed by the Chamber. These and some other Slovenian specifics are connected with, in transitional societies quite unique, relatively centralised collective bargaining system. Highly regulated labour market The presented centralised and highly inclusive collective bargaining system is the most typical part of a dense institutional network, which strongly respects employees interests. The resulting peculiarity of the system is a highly regulated labour market. The basic elements of high regulation are as follows: First, within the last decade Slovenian wages, when compared to the wages in other \u2018transitional\u2019 societies, have been relatively high. Table 1 Average gross monthly wages in Slovenia and two \u2018transitional\u2019 societies, 1990-1998 (in DEM, average exchange rates) (%) 1990 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Slovenia 1453.14 1192.11 1354.89 1435.04 1565.90 1674.28 Hungary 343.53 512.13 442.85 461.90 531.85 554.46 Czech Republic 294.18 388.39 441.25 535.77 585.12 637.64 Source: WIIW 1999 Second, during the last decade relatively high job security has been preserved for the majority of the Slovenian employed workforce. Labour force surveys from the end of the 90s show that the portion of the Slovenian employees in open-ended contracts is still high. Approximately 70% of total employed population is engaged in that most secured form of employment (Ignjatovic and Kramberger, 2000: 454). According to the Eurostat data, the European employed population is included in that type of employment less intensively (European social statistics LF survey results 1999, Eurostat 3). Other data, being consistent with these findings, reveal comparatively weak labour force fluctuation and corresponding companies\u2019 closing vis-\u00e0-vis labour market (see Table 2). It appears that the Slovenian full-time employees tend to be \u2018job-owners\u2019 more than their counterparts in the other compared countries.

        "Third, job security has been combined with markedly soft policies dealing with redundant workforce. These policies show accentuated social nature of the Slovenian \u2018post-communist\u2019 system. In spite of transformational depression and other problems, the reconstruction of the companies implied essentially softer policies than in other countries (see Table 3).

In the context of the described political exchanges and the resulting socially oriented \u2018transitional\u2019 pattern, the nature of the moderate unemployment has significantly changed. At the beginning of the 90s, when public policies enabled workforce contraction (through early retirement schemes) and benefits for a widely defined category of unemployed persons, the Keynesian unemployment appeared. Because of the fast wage increases (as it was in 1993), the classic unemployment gradually substituted the first one. During the decade the government accentuated passive employment policies. It manifested as the third change in unemployment nature at the end of the 90s, when former classic unemployment was transformed, within the still moderate unemployment rate, into the predominately structural, long term unemployment. (Kri\u02c7 zani\u02c7 c, 2002). Dialogue at company level Comparisons of direct and indirect (representative) participation in companies from Slovenia and selected EU and \u2018transitional\u2019 countries show striking Slovenian peculiarities of the dialogue at micro level. According to the comparisons, direct participation is undeveloped and indirect participation strongly developed within the Slovenian organisations (International comparative study, HRM, 2001). 254 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "The condition of direct participation is revealed by the employees\u2019 inclusion into decision making about organisation of work. In comparative terms Slovenian workers are barely included in that type of decision making. This finding indicates that direct participation is undeveloped in Slovenian organisation. In addition to that, Slovenian employees are, compared to their counterparts in other \u2018transitional\u2019 countries, almost totally excluded from decision making about strategy and financial issues.

Collective representative bodies are more developed in Slovenian organisations than in other compared countries. Slovenian peculiarity is not only a dual employee representation consisting of trade unions and works councils, but also unusually high trade union density rates within the companies (see table 5). Table 5 Proportion of organisations from EU, \u2018transitional\u2019 countries and Slovenia with less than 50%, and more than 51% of employees who are members of a trade union (in %) Less than 50% More than 51% EU 45.4 39.7 \u2018Transitional\u2019 countries 56.0 31.2 Slovenia 23.3 74.2 Source: Cranet-E and Slovenian Survey 2001 This finding fits in with the other research findings (Stanojevic, 2000; 2001) suggesting that comparatively strong trade unions exist within the Slovenian organisations. Within the dual representations they usually have a leading role. Undeveloped direct participation is congruent with internal organisational rigidity and corresponding traditional (primarily Fordist) technological structure. Developed indirect participation suggests that collective articulation and manifestation of social demands is strongly presented within Slovenian organisations. This type of micro-constellations determines the nature of the social dialogue at micro level. Considering the traditional, rigid internal organisational structures, it is most likely that strong collective representative bodies would incline towards oppositional stance/behaviour. Empirical evidence confirmed that assumption: between management and employees quite classic \u2018them- and-us\u2019 relations are formed at workplaces in Slovenia. (Stanojevic, 2001) 255 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia ",
        "During the last decade these relationships framed the social dialogue at micro level. The main results of these dialogues were numerous micro political exchanges between workers and managers within Slovenian companies. It seems that exactly these micro exchanges have enabled unusually efficient internal resources\u2019 mobilisation within Slovenian companies during the last decade. The key starting point of all these exchanges was a basic common interest of all stakeholders. All of them were interested in the survival of the organisations. In exchange for the wage and job stability workers and their trade unions were ready for additional work inputs. That additional work enabled them and their organisations to survive the last decade. In other words: in the 90s the success of numerous Slovenian labour intensive companies was based on work intensification, supported and enabled by a kind of surviving coalitions between managers on the one hand, and trade unions and workers on the other. Conclusion The industrial relations diagnosis During the last decade a specific industrial relations system was formed in Slovenia. It strongly deviates from the general neo-liberal pattern that was formed in other transitional societies. Firstly, at the beginning of the 90s the Slovenian transition was marked by strong strike activity. Strikes reached highest level when the transformational depression reached bottom. Exactly in that critical year a structural, long-term change within the electoral body happened. The gravity centre of the political scene moved to the left-centre. Secondly, compared to trade unions from other transitional societies, the Slovenian trade unions are relatively strong organisations. Trade union density rate is significantly higher than in other transitional societies. Other data (about strikes, collective bargaining etc.) indicate that they also have a quite high mobilisation capacity. Thirdly, in accordance to the strong workers\u2019 organisation, the left-centre governments, being generally sensitive to interests presented by trade unions, inclined towards political exchanges and a dialogue with trade unions. At the beginning of the 90s these exchanges initiated and then balanced Slovenian strongly socially oriented and very gradual transition into the market economy. The side result of that process was the industrial relations system with trade unions as influential social partner. Fourthly, the key dimension of the relatively advanced social dialogue is a developed, for the transitional societies atypically centralised, inclusive collective bargaining system. Fifthly, the traditional organisational structures survived and adversarial relations were formed at the micro level. Within the transitional pattern from the 90s these micro relationships were functional. Under escalating competitive pressures, at the background of a highly regulated external labour market, the micro relations enabled formation of a highly motivated surviving coalitions. These were an important short-term advantage of the Slovenian transitional pattern: they secured efficient mobilisation of the internal resources, frequently substituting the slowness of technological renewal by the work intensification. 256 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "Development of social dialogue in the EMU context The identified features of the Slovenian industrial relations system suggest that survival and even further development of the neo-corporative arrangements in Slovenia (within the EMU context) are highly possible. Up to now the government and the trade unions have had the accentuated role in the formation of the industrial relations system. That is why the some kind of mixture of the state and societal corporatism is highly possible in Slovenia. This general inclination towards the relatively strong neo-corporatist arrangements implies the possibility of two basically non-conflict answers to the EMU regime demands. Scenario of the competitive income policies formation The actual social dialogue system enables relatively fast and non-conflictual accommodation of the Slovenian system to the EMU regime. The weakest point of the system is interest cleavage between the employees in public and private sectors of the economy. Under the condition of a successful concertation of these interests, the system could secure formation of the efficient, competitive oriented social pacts - income policies. More complex developmental scenario The key problem of the former competitiveness is its insufficient developmental effect. Because of the identified problems at micro level, the scenario of the competitive income policies is sub- optimal for Slovenia. Widening of a developmental oriented social dialogue (of a sort improving internal organisational flexibilisation) at micro level is essential for Slovenia. Considering actual constellations and relatively developed social dialogue at macro and mezzo levels, the widening should be focused on micro level. A kind of exchange of the accepted flexibility of wages and salaries on the one hand, for increasing employment, training, education, and legal security of employees, on the other, should secure a stable environment for higher, more long-term oriented co-operation at micro level. It should enable development of productivity bargaining and increasing labour productivity as its key implication. It seems that the new social pact, which is close to the final reception, contains these key elements. The main points of the pact are presented in the development plan shown in the annex. 257 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia ",

        "Redrafted following discussions at the tripartite seminar, \u2018Social dialogue and EMU in the candidate countries\u2019, organised by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Vienna 22-24 May 2002. 1. Introduction The social partners in Slovenia, that is, the Slovenian Government and representatives of employers and of employees, are aware that accession to the EU and particularly to EMU signifies both a challenge and an opportunity for greater economic development, and through this a higher standard of living, yet at the same time they are aware that through an excessive desire for rapid approximation to European policies, and through pursuing merely financial and economic goals, social welfare and other vitally important issues might be neglected and the social stability undermined. They are aware that successful accession, and in particular ensuring a position of being an equal partner in the community, will depend on the contribution made by everyone participating in the process, that is the employees, employers and the Government, who must for this reason further enhance their mutual cooperation \u2013 the social dialogue \u2013 and raise it to an even higher level of mutual understanding and trust. 2. Social agreement Aims and tasks The joint tasks and obligations intended to ensure stable development and progress in conditions of social peace, have thus far been defined by the social partners in joint documents such as the social agreement and the agreement on wages policy. The social agreement for the period 2002- 2005, on which intensive negotiations are currently being concluded between the social partners, sets out two main aims: (cid:2) balanced economic and social development and (cid:2) meeting the criteria for EU accession. The social partners see fulfilment of the criteria for EU accession primarily as one of the conditions for the sustainable development, which they wish to achieve irrespective of EU accession. The partners take the view that one of the priority tasks during this period is achieving greater competitive capacity for the Slovenian economy, founded upon: (cid:2) increasing labour productivity, (cid:2) knowledge, (cid:2) increased investment in development of the human resources, (cid:2) a high level of employment, (cid:2) fair pay for workers and (cid:2) increased concern for occupational health and safety. Annex Development plan of the Republic of Slovenia 259 ",
        "Balanced social development will be enhanced by the following policies, which occupy an important place in the social agreement: Wages policy The wages policy should function both as an incentive for workers, and at the same time it should not jeopardise further investment in development. On the national level in Slovenia, in the coming years the aim will be to achieve a pace of wages growth that will be kept behind labour productivity growth by 1%. At the same time, the aim will be to: (cid:2) rationalise wages policy in the public sector (cid:2) maintain purchasing power on the current level (cid:2) increase the link between pay and performance. The manner of increasing wages in the private sector is set out in the Wages Policy Agreement for the period 2002 to 2004, which was concluded as a part to the social agreement and provides twice yearly adjustment of wages to the growth in consumer prices. In the public sector a slower growth in wages is provided than that seen hitherto, with an agreed greater gap of wages growth behind the growth in prices, in accordance with the annex concluded to the collective agreement for the public sector. These two documents mark the policy agreement for the short term, that is until the beginning of 2004, and for the ensuing period the partners are committed through the aforementioned wage agreement to setting down their long-term tasks in a social agreement. Increasing employment Concern for increased employment must be present among all three partners, since the programmes that can be financed from public funds are not sufficient for eliminating unemployment. Through active employment programmes organised on the national level and through additionally raising awareness of the need for lifelong learning and investment in development and employee training, among both employers and employees, it will be possible to secure greater growth in employment and greater employability of individuals. This approach will secure a more efficient dealing with the structural unemployment problem. The priority tasks are therefore: (cid:2) educating the work force, both unemployed and employed (cid:2) promoting lifelong learning The difference in wages growth and growth of Gross Domestic Product must also be directed towards increasing employment. Maintaining the achieved level of social security In the proposed social agreement the partners noted that they were unanimous in thinking that providing social security for oneself and one\u2019s family is the concern of each individual, and can most easily be secured through active participation on the labour market. They are aware, however, that for objective reasons a certain section of the population is unable to do this. In democratic societies such as Slovenia, concern for such individuals and their families is the concern of the 260 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",
        "state, which must therefore draw up special programmes and allocate a certain portion of public funds. The partners agree that an active social policy is the correct approach to dealing with this problem, and they will therefore strive to fulfil the adopted guidelines and implement the agreed social policy, which is orientated towards encouraging and supporting assistance for those who need it, so that to the greatest possible extent they can become actively involved in providing for themselves. Increasing concern for occupational safety and health The social partners in Slovenia understand the importance of concern for the safety and health of employees, and in the proposed social agreement they also devoted special attention to this area. Increasing legal security of employees Strengthening the institutions providing legal security for employees stands as one of the priority tasks of the social partners, and this area also has an important place in the proposed social agreement. In Slovenia the basic conditions, these being appropriate legislation, and institutions which enable the implementation and overseeing of such legislation, have to a large extent already been secured. The social partners can contribute a great deal towards improving the situation in this area by encouraging their members to change their relations in the immediate work place, and to raise the level of mutual cooperation between employers and workers, and by developing new forms of peaceful paths towards resolving disputes. Meeting the criteria for EU accession Approximation to the criteria for accession to the EU will require in particular that Slovenia halts the relatively high growth in prices and ensures a greater balancing of public finances. For this reason these two areas are also included in the social agreement, which sets out the goals and tasks of the social partners in this regard. Inflation In line with the proposed agreement, the Government must in future conduct the kind of policy governing prices of public services and certain products which are partly still under its control, in such a way that the harmonisation of these prices with those of neighbouring countries and EU countries will not have a negative effect on inflation trends. A contribution to calming prices growth must also be made by employers and employees through appropriate wages growth and by the Bank of Slovenia through appropriate monetary policy. Balanced public finances In the area of public finances, the Government should conduct a policy whereby it will be able to allocate a greater part of budget resources to development, while at the same time easing the burden on the economy by reducing the share of public finance revenue from GDP. For this reason a reform of the tax system will be needed, and this will bring a more appropriate distribution of the tax burdens, through amendment of the valid legislation and through the introduction of new regulations which will ensure new tax sources which have hitherto not been included in the tax system. 261 Social dialogue and EMU in Slovenia ",
        "3. Conclusion By concluding the aforementioned social agreement, the social partners will define their tasks in the coming four years, and will also fix their mutual relations and manner of cooperating. They will also further increase their knowledge and experience in this area under the Phare project \u2018Enhancement of social dialogue\u2019, which will start this autumn. The purpose of this programme is to involve the greatest number possible of those participating in the social dialogue on all levels, to increase their knowledge and enhance their negotiating abilities and to increase awareness on the importance of social dialogue as a crucial element of economic and social development among all participants in the process. Special attention will be focussed on the development of social dialogue at company level. Another aim is to prepare the social partners for social dialogue at European level. Part of the project will be aimed at strengthening the Economic and Social Council, or rather to draw up the legal basis for its operation, and also at improving the system of monitoring collective bargaining in Slovenia. 262 Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries ",

The report looks at each country\u2019s capacity to support the convergence process towards the Maastricht criteria, by means of national development programmes currently in operation. Above all, it shows how social dialogue can be harnessed to generate economic growth in conjunction with employment and social protection in these countries.
