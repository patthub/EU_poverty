        "[ 7 ] F OREWORD In the two years since the fi rst major conference organized by the European Commission on Crisis Response in Europe, in 2006, the European Union has enhanced its capacity to deal with international crises and natural disasters. First, fi nancial resources for crisis response interventions have grown substantially, reach- ing into the budget for CFSP/ESDP operations and the new Instrument for Stability. The year 2008 began with major EU operations in Chad and Kosovo as well as 20 ongoing and planned crisis response projects under the Stability Instrument, around the world. In addi- tion, European institutions have strengthened their operational cooperation. Second, EU resources are being integrated with those of Member States, NGOs and the think-tank community in Europe and beyond. We are developing a new Peace-building Partnership to promote closer co-operation between NGOs, EU institutions and Member States. Third, we have been focusing on reacting faster to reliable early warning information, a key challenge for the European Union in the fi eld of Crisis Response and Peace-building. This new book illustrates the progress made in these three areas and emphasizes the nexus between early warning and early action. It is based on contributions to the Conference \u201cFrom Early Warning to Early Action\u201d of November 2007, which brought together practitioners in the fi eld and drew on the wealth of civilian expertise on peace-building issues, identifying ways of responding to crises faster and more coherently. Much remains to be done, but I believe that the ideas expressed in this book show what it takes for peace-building to be carried out successfully; that freedom from fear and want, freedom to take action on one\u2019s own behalf and freedom from effects of natural disasters are not utopian ideals. I commend this book, thank the contributors and look forward to further developing and implementing its ideas in the months and years to come. B ENITA F ERRERO -W ALDNER ",

        "[ 11 ] I NTRODUCTION Three contradictory conceptions of security clash in the contemporary public discourse: one equates security with (pre-emptive) attack, the other relates security to defence; the third connects security to peace and freedom from fear. In all three cases \u2014 the latter being the most representative of the European institutions\u2019 doctrine \u2014 the link between early warning and early action is critical to prevent the loss of human lives. A search through open sources quickly reveals hundreds of documents describing recent systemic failures to connect warnings to action: the 2000 fl oods in Mozambique 1 , the 2001 food security crisis in Sudan 2 , the 2003 fl oods in the Philippines 3 , the 2004 Sahel locust invasion and Niger food crisis 4 , the 2006 landslide in the Philippines 5 , the 2006 Tsunami in Java 6 , the 2007 earthquake in Sumatra 7 , the 2008 dengue fever epidemics in Paraguay 8 and bird fl u in West Bengal 9 . To this, we should add the ex post analysis on the intelligence failures that led to the Rwandan genocide 10 , to 9/11, to the War in Iraq 11 , to the crisis with North Korea in 2006 12 , to the \u201cunexpected\u201d victory of Hamas in the same year 13 , to the 7/7 attacks in London 14 , to the wave of terrorist attacks that shook India in 2007 15 , to the Ejercito Popular Revolucionario attacks in Mexico in 2007 16 , to the Red Mosque crisis in Pakistan 17 , to Darfur 18 , and lately, to the crisis in Kenya 19 . A warning is defi ned as an \u201cintimation\u201d, a \u201cthreat\u201d, a \u201csign of impending danger or evil\u201d. We are surrounded by these signs. Wars have always been around us, and complete freedom from fear is a state of grace that few countries can claim to enjoy. So there is little in these areas that comes as totally \u201cunexpected\u201d. Asia is the region of the world that, statistically, is the most exposed to deadly natural disasters. There are more than a hundred political confl icts around the world (130 according to the HIIK report for 2007), the great majority of which have deep roots going back over time. The geo-strategic implications of fossil fuel reserves have certainly not been discovered in the last decade. The spillover effect of the Middle East confl ict has been with us for the last 50 years. When can policymakers really afford to claim that they have been taken by surprise? What does explain the failures of the world\u2019s intelligence superpowers? What can jus- tify the fact that \u2014 almost on a yearly basis \u2014 natural catastrophes continue to claim lives all over the world, regardless of the Internet, the mathematical models available, the super computers, the ground detection technologies, and the earth observation facilities? Scholars and policy-makers say we are living in an \u201cinformation society\u201d: is this really the context in which strategic decisions in the fi eld of international relations are taken? Andrea Ricci designed and runs the Crisis Room of the Directorate-General for External Relations of the European Commission. He conceived both Tariqa and the Directorate- General for External Relations\u2019 internal training programme for Open Source Intelligence. He represents the Commission in the working group that defi nes the EU watchlist. Previously he was responsible for the EuroMediterranean Information Society Initiative (EUMEDIS). Mr Ricci holds a Master\u2019s degree in European Studies from the College of Europe (Bruges). He is currently working on his PhD on \u201cDigital Propaganda\u201d with the Catholic University of Brussels and the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles. ",
        "[ 12 ] Joseph Stiglitz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in October 2001 for his con- tribution to the study of imperfect information. He received the prestigious award for having criticised a key assumption of traditional economic analysis. Stieglitz\u2019s works have largely been devoted to prove and elaborate the idea that competitive markets are not effi cient , as the classic competitive model suggests. Individuals and companies do not possess perfect information: individuals do not necessarily buy at the lowest price, while companies do not necessarily produce at the lowest costs. One of the ways we can explain the recent failures in intelligence and early warning is that we cannot rely on the assumption that \u201cperfect in- formation\u201d exists in the context of diplomacy, humanitarian relief and intelligence. Policy making is often carried out on the basis of imperfect information; it\u2019s ineffi cient. The use of available knowledge is often not adequate to the challenges we face. One of the causes of imperfect information is its asymmetry: if one counts the number of articles on any given country in the world as delivered daily by Google News 20 one can eas- ily discover a set of hypertrophic signals (Iraq with an average of 448 articles, followed by Iran with 307 articles daily on average, and Afghanistan with 265.5) and many hypotrophic signals such as Venezuela (149.6), Somalia (79.6), Kenya (76.4) and Zimbabwe (64.48). Re- gardless of the gravity of the situation, the humanitarian implications or the losses of hu- man lives, a strong signal \u201cblocks out\u201d a weak one. Iraq blocks out Iran, which blocks out Afghanistan, which blocks out Venezuela, which blocks out Somalia, Kenya and Zimbabwe. It would be totally unrealistic to assume that these asymmetries are not matched by equally asymmetric political attention, intelligence monitoring, project responses, public compas- sion etc. The attention economy and the compassion economy are ineffi cient, in the same way as economic behaviour in general. The shares of attention given to each confl ict in the world are not all equal. Too many wars; not enough digestible knowledge on the vast majority of them. Politicians, diplomats, humanitarian workers, mediators, intelligence operatives are part of the same ecosystem, constrained by the same environmental factors. They all suffer from information asymmetries. The whole point is the need to adapt to the environment. Money and human resources have not saved the world\u2019s intelligence superpowers from dramatic failures. Those who introduce change in their working methods will be able to exploit the energy available in the ecosystem to their advantage. Who will adapt fi rst? The Information Society \u2013 where it exists \u2013 provides the opportunity to acquire more in- formation faster, often overcoming constraints of time and space. Today, across the world, ",
        "[ 13 ] the Internet generates an estimated 61 billion queries a month 21 . But will those analysts, diplomats, relief workers, and intelligence offi cers that only read through the fi rst search results page have any form of information superiority ? More than 4000 TV channels are available through satellite in most parts of Europe. What happens to the organisation that structures its work under the tacit knowledge that television programmes are not sources of professional, qualifi ed warnings? What happens to the analytical group that refuses to treat the content of 70 million blogs 22 in order to protect themselves from disinformation? What happens to the diplomat that cannot or does not want to have meetings with all the representatives of a given country\u2019s political class? What happens to the relief team that considers as a \u201cnegative priority\u201d the costs of online pay-per-view databases for its fi eld operations? What happens to the policy-maker who is unaware of the difference between the BBC World Service and the BBC Monitoring? We have the opportunity to live in and take advantage of the information society, only the opportunity. One of the tangible consequences of the growth of electronic media is the evolution of the notion of secrecy. While more and more sensitive information is leaked to the press, or through opposition newsgroups and blogs, the number of functional secrets is growing geometrically. Countless relevant entities, facts, events, details that nobody wants to con- ceal de jure , are becoming invisible de facto. Nobody was hiding the \u201cweak signals\u201d which progressively led C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to the 2004 crisis: everyone could have noted the semantic changes in the fabric of public debate on Abidjan.net, one of the most (if not the most) rel- evant discussion forum on the African continent. There was a visible, tangible change of tone: a rupture in the discourse tonality which ended up being matched by violent action. That content was, and still is for many who need to know, a functional secret: something that works like a secret but it is not one. The phenomenal amount of information available (just think of the number of individual databases available through Factiva or Lexis Nexis) is theoretically within reach for every one of us, but access cost and sophisticated query syntaxes continue to be the main barriers separating decision-makers from mission-critical information. A new form of illiteracy has emerged: we all have Google but none of us knows how to make it work to its full potential. Not to mention Lexis Nexis with its Boolean operators, smart indexing etc. In 2008, it would be hard for any practitioner of CFSP in Brussels to quote an existing educational programme for ministries or security agencies dealing with the issues of sourcing and their relevance for early warning. Far too many continue to consider alternative sources of security-related information as dangerous or simply extracurricular. ",
        "[ 14 ] The Information Society \u2013 we should probably call it the oblivion society 23 - is drasti- cally widening the gap between the information we can get hold of and the information we understand. Again, this phenomenon is not new: in the 50s Harold Innis, a disciple of the Canadian Professor McLuhan, wrote \u201cImprovements in communication [...] make for increased diffi culties of understanding\u201d 24 . The consequences today are tangible: the in- telligence interception capacity (or simply the amount of information projected through various channels to the existing practitioner community) generates volumes of content; so much that the human resources available are unable to group, fi lter, digest and trans- form it into action. Those who try to adapt to the new environment without guidance are often discouraged by the fact that these new rules and tools impose a complete re- defi nition of the workfl ow and of the tacit assumptions that often hold sway in many professional environments. With Open Source Intelligence we measure the relative value of an organisation\u2019s body of knowledge: what we thought was classifi ed turns out to be in the public domain, what we discarded as being an \u201cuntrusted source\u201d becomes (sadly, after the event) the clearest form of early warning. When we thought the fi eld operatives had the best information pictures, we realize that the databases we could consult from our offi ces had more. If, on the one hand, abundant empirical evidence seems to prove the importance of open sources in terms of early warning, on the other hand practitioners have rapidly under- stood that turning open source information into open source intelligence (and warnings) takes time, money and a lot of systematic work. Without suffi cient fi nancial support, it is impossible to exploit high volumes of information from multiple types of sources. With- out the systematic exploitation of multiple sources (a truly trans-media exploitation) it is almost impossible to overcome the bias of media and the effect of propaganda 25 . Finally, without a multidisciplinary background it is hard to cope with the diversity of open con- tent. Methodology is what makes the difference between watching TV, surfi ng the web and carrying out OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). The alignment factor brings an additional explanatory dimension to the issue of failed early warnings. The transition from warning to action is achieved though a form of cen- trifugal communication . It is actually the repetition in eccentric circles of a basic sequence: an important detail is isolated from the stream of information; the detail is amplifi ed and interpreted. Then the interpretation is fi rst shared then agreed by a larger community. Every time the sequence is repeated successfully, energy and speed are added to the proc- ess. Without a communication process this energy does not succeed in crossing the bor- ",
        "[ 15 ] ders that separate analytical units, competing risk assessment entities in a single country, and policy units across EU Member States and EU institutions. The opportunities for all these gears to misalign, to interrupt the consensus dynamics are so numerous, and the combination of co-factors generating disagreement is so large 26 that it should not surprise anyone if the system produces sub-optimal results. When early warning fails it is often because the alignment process has been stopped in one or more locations. When warnings lead to action is because the consensus has been reached in time, or because a given political elite has chosen to act before the full con- sensus has been reached. The greater the decision-making system, the more diffi cult is to act before a full consensus is achieved. Therefore for most European practitioners of early warning the point is not only being capable of detecting a weak signal, but also sharing the fi ndings with others and developing an opinion movement in favour of a given type of action. Advocacy groups such as International Crisis Group, the Crisis Management Initiative, and Human Rights Watch are precisely in that business. They have a chance to shape Europe\u2019s political agenda by launching warnings under their own initiative. There is no shortage of external advocacy. To cope with the new information environ- ment, the EU should act on the motivation dynamics of its crisis responders workforce and should encourage bottom-up initiatives. This would result in novel forms of advocacy, coming from within institutions and administrations. Other schools of thought, less opti- mistic about the chances of an endogenous organisational change of EU\u2019s early warning machinery, see in the Lisbon Treaty and in the future External Service an opportunity to merge in a single structure all the early warning centres established in the course of the past ten years in Brussels. This could be an effective move. The creation of a central inves- tigative \u201cpool\u201d has been a key factor in the fi ght against Cosa Nostra. There are however other, equally necessary, moves to be made if the future EU early-warning system is to succeed. First it is necessary to understand that early warning will remain poly-centric in Europe. So once the several hundred offi cials in Brussels are under a single authority, the real challenge will be to encourage sharing, or force sharing (politically) among all the existing early warning centres across the continent. It\u2019s the challenge of the communitari- sation of intelligence and early warning, a debate launched in 2004 by political leaders from Belgium and Austria after the terrorist bombings in Madrid. An investigative pool in Brussels will not alone boost political will. Sharing human resources and competences in Brussels will not be enough without funds and tools, both in Brussels and elsewhere. The EU also needs a \u201ctool-pool initiative\u201d, aiming at sharing all the OSINT technology available both in Member States and in Brussels. In this respect the recent creation of both ",
        "[ 16 ] the EUROSINT Forum and of the \u201cClub of Budapest\u201d under the initiative of the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs are encouraging signs of change. If politics is about selective attention and subjective (if not partisan) decisions, it is un- realistic to assume that priority setting in the fi eld of external relations will in the near future become easy to achieve at national, and a fortiori at European level. It would be equally unrealistic to pretend that political judgment \u2013 which is above all a matter of re- sponsible choice \u2013 will disappear from all the European fora for CFSP, together with the notion of opportunity, prudence, public sensitivity and sovereignty. The point is having the possibility to choose the best course of action. More intelligence and more warnings will help identify alternatives. Before we can benefi t from more shared intelligence, we have to avoid reducing (or attempting to control) complexity arbitrarily. If policymakers do not possess a reference, short-termism becomes the structuring ele- ment of political judgement and the political / theoretical discourse is forced (ex post) to adapt to practice. This is another environmental challenge. To adapt to the constraints of 2008, we have to modernize diplomacy, relief work and intelligence. Cluster analysis is a statistical exploratory tool designed to reveal natural groupings (or clusters) within a data set that would otherwise not be apparent. Cluster analysis is constantly used in electoral studies, political and mass marketing. The External Relations Directorate-General has been using it in the past few years to provide to the inter-insti- tutional early warning community an alternative method to assess monitoring priorities worldwide. This is a method which is both objective and scientifi cally-based 27 since it uses a wide range of quantitative and qualitative references to assess \u201cfamilies\u201d of countries sharing the same commonalities of risk. The method, as almost everything in nature, is not perfect, since it depends on a subjective selection of criteria (or indicators) of risk. These criteria however are not chosen arbitrarily as they refl ect the doctrine of the Community, and data comes from some of the most prominent risk assessment think tanks worldwide. The results of the cluster analysts are very interesting: instead of having a world rank- ing, the analysis delivers an accurate portrait of the complexity of the world\u2019s insecurity. There are groups of countries sharing almost identical patterns of risk although they are located in very different continents. This method has great early warning potential for the entire community of crisis responders, as it overcomes the natural geographic com- partmentalisation of both monitoring and project response. ",
        "[ 17 ] The book Two years after the fi rst large-scale event dedicated to the enhancement of EU\u2019s crisis response capacity, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner addressed a new consensus conference \u201cFrom Early Warning to Early action\u201d in November 2007 in Brussels. The conference in- volved more than 900 diplomats, offi cers, practitioners, scholars and advocates, represent- ing the complex social network of European crisis responders. This book, builds on the previous publication (Faster and More United?), and aims at extending and consolidating the debate on early warning with a wide range of relevant contributions from all the ac- tors of crisis management, governmental and non-governmental. The fi rst part of the book serves as introduction to the key concepts and the most im- portant changes at EU level, in particular the launch of the Instrument for Stability. It also provides key fi gures: according to the HIIK Confl ict Barometer the overall number of po- litical confl icts has raised slightly since the last measurement. The second part provides witness accounts of crisis response projects and initiatives in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Balkans. The third part is devoted to the issue of resource competition and re- source wars, but also to the debate on the impact of climate change on the frequency of hazardous events. The fourth part focuses on the practice and organization of warning systems with a focus on confl ict prevention, the fi ght against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. This book has been conceived as a manual allowing several reading paths. One, photo- graphic, which reminds the reader of the human tragedies behind political initiatives and projects. Another is more descriptive, aiming at facilitating the learning process of the new generation of practitioners. A third is more technical, aiming at sharing new prac- tices among the existing professionals. This volume benefi ts from the remarkable quality of seminal papers such as those of Johan Galtung on peacebuilding, Albrecht Schnabel on early warning methodology, and of Cedric de Coning on the unintended consequences of peacebuilding. The book is enhanced by the outspoken tone of all the interviews, par- ticularly those featuring Maggy Barankitse \u2013 who has alone saved thousands of children victims of the Rwandan confl ict \u2013 and Ambrose James on the importance of media as in- strument for peace and stability in Africa. For a more expert audience it is important to point readers with little time at their dis- posal to the technical quality of the contributions coming from European practitioners (for ",

Finally, this book offers EU policy and decision-makers the opportunity to refl ect on the growing importance of Track II diplomacy as one of the most interesting tools at the dis- posal of EU policymakers in the fi eld of peacebuilding. Offi cial documents on the new Instrument for Stability and practical information on the Peacebuilding Partnership are also annexed to this work to foster the involvement of Euro- pean non-state actors in peacebuilding and crisis response. 1 \u2018Dealing with natural hazards in Mozambique: the case of the 2000 fl oods\u2019 http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ae079e/ae079e05.htm 2 \u2018\u2018D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: Early Warning and Late Response\u2014General Reasons for a Recurrent Problem\u2019 http://www.fews.net/centers/fi les/ East_200105en.pdf 3 \u2018See http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ad695e/ad695e04.htm#TopOfPage 4 \u2018\u2018Programme performance of the United Nations for the biennium 2004-2005\u2019 www.un.org/depts/oios/mecd/a_61_64e.doc 5 \u2018\u2018Philippines was aware of risks of landslides ; Manila knew of danger as early as May\u2019 - 22 February 2006, The International Herald Tribune ; by Carlos H.

When images, or recorded witness accounts are lacking, the information shrinks, explaining most of failures occurring in the African context or in several crisis prone rural areas. The diversifi cation of sources, the lowering of the access costs to certain types of channels (newsgroups, blogs, mailing lists) has also given a tremendous impulsion to propaganda. Contemporary forms of terrorisms have become, for example, totally internet-centric. 26 Different working agendas, different gathering and interpretation capacity, the number of targets exceeding the resources available, different defi nition of risk, different administrative cultures, competition between risk assessment entities etc. Historic links, physical proximity, presence of diasporas in the Member States, economic interests and much more are all good reasons to distance the positions of every EU Member State. 27 Cluster analyses can be performed using the TwoStep, Hierarchical, or K-Means Cluster Analysis procedures. Each procedure employs a different algorithm for creating clusters, and each has options not available in the others. For our application we have chosen to use the TwoStep Cluster Analysis procedure. It provides the following unique features: the automatic selection of the best number of clusters, in addition to measures for choosing between cluster models; and the ability to create cluster models simultaneously based on categorical and continuous variables.

        "Global Development In 2007, a total of 328 political confl icts were identifi ed. Among these, 31 confl icts involved a massive amount of violence (six wars and 25 severe crises), and 99 were conducted with only sporadic use of vio- lence and were, therefore, classifi ed as cri- ses. These crises and highly violent confl icts amounted to 130 violent confl icts. In con- trast, 198 non-violent confl icts were also counted and can be subdivided into 118 manifest and 80 latent confl icts. Compared with 2006, the number of wars remained the same (six), fi ve of which were already being fought out at this intensity in 2006: Sudan (Darfur), Somalia (UIC), Sri Lanka (LTTE), Afghanistan (Taliban), and Iraq (insurgents). Two of these, Sudan and Iraq, were therefore classifi ed as wars for the fourth year run- ning. Last year\u2019s sixth war, Israel (Hezbol- lah), signifi cantly de-escalated to a non-vio- lent level following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon in October 2006. How- ever, the former severe crisis in Waziristan, Pakistan\u2019s border region with Afghanistan, escalated to a war in 2007 (Pakistan, North and South Waziristan). Chart 1: Global Intensities in 2006-2007 The number of severe crises decreased from 30 to 25, 16 of which had been clas- sifi ed at the same level in 2006. Six esca- lated from the level of a crisis in 2006 to a severe crisis in 2007. Two \u2014 the confl ict between the two main rebel groups in Co- lombia (FARC - ELN) and the opposition confl ict in Burma/Myanmar (opposition) \u2014 had been manifest confl icts, i.e. non-violent, in 2006. One severe crisis, Mexico (drug cartels), emerged as a new confl ict in 2007. Those of last year\u2019s severe crises that were not conducted at this level of intensity in 2007 developed as follows: one, Pakistan (North and South Waziristan) escalated to a war; thirteen de-escalated, ten out of these to the level of a crisis, and three wih the level of a latent confl ict. Overall, 31 highly violent confl icts were counted in 2007, in comparison with 36 in 2006. This indicates a considerable de- escalation after last year\u2019s escalation com- pared to 2005 during which only 30 highly violent confl icts were recorded, the lowest number since 1984. The number of crises, however, decreased only slightly in relation to their high number: 99 in 2007 compared with 104 in 2006. Chart 2: Ongoing global confl icts of low, medium, and high intensity 1945 to 2007 The number of non-violent conflicts grew from 186 to 198, as latent confl icts increased from 72 to 80, and manifest con- T HE GLOBAL CONFLICT BAROMETER Nicolas Schwank M.A. is a researcher at the Institute for Political Science at the University of Heidelberg.

[ 23 ] Global confl ict intensities in 2007 compared to 2006 Number of confl icts ",
        "fl icts increased at almost the same rate with 117 in 2007 compared with 114 in 2006. The total number of confl icts rose slight- ly from 326 to 328, as eight confl icts had ended in 2006 and ten new ones arose in 2007. One of the terminated confl icts was located in Europe, four in Africa, and three in the Middle East and Maghreb. Of the new confl icts, three emerged in Europe, two in Africa, three in the Americas, and two in Asia and Oceania. While only four of the ten new confl icts were conducted without the use of violence, fi ve were crises and one a severe crisis right from the start. In order to reveal a long-term trend, the fi ve inten- sity levels are categorized into three groups: the two non-violent levels are summarized as low intensity, crises as medium intensity, and severe crises and wars as confl icts of high intensity. Chart 2 also displays the total number of confl icts observed. As the graph shows, the number of confl icts observed per year has risen more or less continu- ously from 81 in 1945 to 328 in 2006, most of which are low-intensity confl icts. When looking at the high-intensity confl icts, a continuous and regular increase is evident, from seven in 1945 to 41 in 2004, inter- rupted by minor phases of de-escalation. The all-time high was 49 high intensity con- fl icts in 1992, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. After a spectacular drop to only 30 in 2005, the number of highly vio- lent confl icts rose again to 36 in 2006, but decreased to 31 in 2007. On the other hand, the number of crises soared to previously unknown heights in recent years, indicating a change in confl ict conduct. While fewer confl icts were fought with the systematic use of large-scale violence, more and more disputes were waged with the sporadic use of violence, e.g. ambushes, guerrilla attacks, bombings and the like. Analysis intrastate - interstate The 328 confl icts in 2007 can be catego- rised as 238 internal and 90 interstate con- fl icts. The former category comprised four confl icts that can be classifi ed as transna- tional, since at least one confl ict party is a non-state actor. Also, the main base of operations of which is located in a country other than its opponent\u2019s, be it a state or another non-state actor. Since the struc- ture of these confl icts (non-state actor vs. state or another non-state actor) resembles the structure of intrastate confl icts, they are subsumed into this category here. Chart 3: Number of intra- and interstate confl icts in 2007 by intensity level All six wars in 2007 were internal con- fl icts, as were all the severe crises, one of which, Chad (ethnic groups), was transna- tional. Therefore, after last year\u2019s severe interstate crisis between Israel and Leba- non [Israel - Lebanon], no confl ict between states was fought out at either of the two highest intensity levels. However, six of the 99 crises were interstate [Armenia - Azerbaijan; Chad - Sudan; Uganda - DR Congo (Lake Albert); Colombia - Ecuador; Israel - Lebanon; Syria - Israel], whereas 93 were intrastate (none transnational).

        "Chart 4: Ongoing intra- and interstate confl icts of high intensity 1945 to 2007 Of the six interstate crises, the confl ict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the one between Chad and Sudan had already been conducted at the same intensity level in 2006, while Israel - Lebanon had been a severe crisis in 2006. The confl ict between Uganda and DR Congo was new, and the remaining two disputes had been manifest confl icts in 2006. Of the non-violent con- fl icts, 42 latent and 72 manifest confl icts were intrastate (including one and two tran- snational confl icts, respectively), and 38 latent as well as 46 manifest confl icts were interstate. Therefore, intrastate confl icts outnumbered interstate confl icts not only in total, but also at every intensity level. The long-term analysis, for which the two high intensity levels, severe crisis and war, were summarized into one group, clearly shows that the predominance of highly violent intrastate confl icts can be observed from the beginning of the period examined. The current low number of interstate wars and severe crises, however, was a more recent development supposedly due to the end of the Cold War. Regional Development At 109, almost a third of all confl icts were located in Asia and Oceania. Second came Africa with 78, third Europe with 55, then the Middle East and Maghreb and the Americas with 43 each. Asia and Oceania also had the largest number of crises with [ 25 ] Number of intra- and interstate confl icts in 2007 by intensity level Ongoing intra- and interstate confl icts of high intensity 1945 to 2007 ",
        "39, as well as the largest number of non- violent confl icts, 61. Chart 5: Distribution of all confl icts in 2007 by region and intensity type Concerning highly violent confl icts, the Middle East and Maghreb ranked fi rst with ten, two of them wars and Africa was joint second with Asia, each with nine highly violent confl icts and in each region two of the confl icts were wars. This means that Africa and the Middle East and Maghreb have switched places. This change was the result of a remarkable de-escalation in Af- rica, with high-intensity confl icts decreasing from 15 in 2006 to only nine in 2007, while their number in the Middle East and Magh- reb increased from nine to ten. In the Ameri- cas, the number of highly violent confl icts rose signifi cantly from only one in 2006 to three in 2007. In contrast, no high-intensi- ty confl ict was counted in Europe for the fi rst time since 1967, as the previous years\u2019 persistent severe crisis in Chechnya [Russia (Chechen rebels/Chechnya)] de-escalated to the level of a crisis and no new highly violent confl ict emerged. This is even more remarkable, as Europe had the third larg- est number of confl icts and with 16 also the third largest number of crises (Asia and Oceania 39, Africa 24). In the Middle East and Maghreb, only six crises were count- ed, eight fewer than in the America. There- fore, most remarkably, more high-intensity confl icts than crises were fought out in the Middle East and Maghreb, whereas the structure of the distribution of the confl icts between the intensity groups, if summarized into three groups (low, medium, and high intensity), normally resembles a pyramid, with the high-intensity confl icts on top. If the number of states per region is taken into account and the number of confl icts related to the number of states, the Middle East and Maghreb\u2019s pole position becomes even clearer. Not only that, the average number of highly violent confl icts per state was al- most 0.5 in this region (the world average being around 0.2), while Africa had 0.2, Asia and Oceania 0.1, the Americas less than 0.1, and Europe zero. Also, the Middle East and Maghreb with 2.1 had the highest overall average number of confl icts per state, there- by replacing Asia and Oceania as the region with most confl icts. The world average was around 1.7. Asia and Oceania as well as Africa displayed values around that mean, while Europe and America had only about one confl ict per state on average. Dynamics within individual confl icts Approximately two-thirds of all confl icts, some 215 out of 328, remained at the same intensity level from 2006 to 2007. While a total of 36 confl icts escalated \u2014 six of these by two levels \u2014 67 confl icts de-escalated. Of the latter, 61 cases de-escalated by one level, two by two levels, and four by three levels. Therefore, the de-escalation from 2006 to 2007 is quite remarkable, with not only the number of high-intensity confl icts decreas- ing, but also the confl icts de-escalating far outnumbering the confl icts that escalated. In 2006, the overall number of escalating and de-escalating confl icts had been equal, with [ 26 ] Ongoing intra- and interstate confl icts of high intensity 1945 to 2007 ",
        "escalation more often than de-escalation taking place over two intensity levels.

Four escalated from a latent confl ict to a crisis [Estonia (Russian-speaking minority); Mexico (EPR/Guerrero); Niger (Tuareg/Aga- dez); Pakistan (opposition)], and two from a manifest confl ict to a severe crisis [Colom- bia (FARC - ELN) and Burma/Myanmar (op- position)]. Therefore, a total of 18 confl icts turned violent in 2007, and in addition, twelve confl icts escalated from the level of a manifest confl ict to a crisis. Of the other confl icts escalating by one level, six turned from a crisis into a severe crisis [Ethiopia (ONLF/Ogaden); Kenya (ethnic groups); Pa- kistan (Islamists); Iraq (al-Zarqawi group); Israel (Fatah \u2013 Hamas); Lebanon (Hezbol- lah, Fatah al-Islam)], and one turned from a severe crisis into a war [Pakistan (North and South Waziristan)]. The remaining elev- en remained non-violent, escalating only from a latent to a manifest confl ict. One of the four confl icts that de-escalated by three levels turned from a war to a manifest con- fl ict [Israel (Hezbollah)], as no more violent incidents between the confl ict parties were reported after Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Leb- anon. Three cases went from severe crisis to latent confl ict [Ethiopia (Guji - Borena); Guinea-Bissau (MFDC-Sadio); Sudan (Nuer, White Army \u2013 SPLM/A)]. In Sudan, this was due to the overwhelming force of the Su- dan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), causing the White Army to fi nally abandon the area in 2006; in Guinea-Bissau, the security forces had succeeded in push- ing the rebels over the border to Senegal\u2019s Casamance region, where they had origi- nated [Senegal (MFDC-Sadio/Casamance)]. Both confl icts de-escalating by two lev- els decreased from crisis to latent confl ict. Therefore, all six confl icts de-escalating by more than one level turned from violent to non-violent. In addition, 28 crises decreased to manifest confl icts. Therefore, altogether 34 confl icts ceased being violent between 2006 and 2007, underlining the signifi cant de-escalation that took place in 2007. Confl ict Items Continuing its position in 2006, the prev- alent confl ict item in 2007 was system/ide- ology with 85 cases. This item signifi es that the respective disputes were conducted in order to change the political or economic system or concerned ideological differences, e.g. striving for a theocracy as opposed to a secular state; religious differences; seeking democracy in an autocracy; or striving for a different economic order. Resources ranked second with 67, closely followed by national power with 62. It should be noted that con- fl icts were often centred on more than one item. Therefore, the same confl ict might occur twice or three times in this analysis. Combinations of the three most frequent items were common, as was the combina- tion of territory and resources, regional pre- dominance and resources, or international power and system/ideology. More than half of the system confl icts as well as the national power confl icts were fought out with the use of violence. Among these, 15 of the system confl icts and eleven of the national power confl icts were even highly violent. Three of each of these were wars. Half of the disputes over regional predominance were violent, in- cluding nine highly violent ones. The lat- ter comprised two wars, i.e. Sudan (Darfur) and Pakistan (North and South Waziristan). Disputes concerning autonomy were violent in half of the cases, including two highly violent confl icts. Almost three-quarters of secession confl icts (32 of 45) were fought out violently, featuring six highly violent confl icts, including the war in Sri Lanka [Sri Lanka (LTTE)]. In contrast, confl icts over resources were conducted violently in less than one-third of the cases (however, six of those were highly violent). This might be due to the fact that resources can be shared among the confl ict parties, while certain other items, such as ideological questions, power, or self- [ 27 ] ",

Secession or autonomy were, however, sought only occasionally. System/ideology was a rare confl ict item in both Europe and Africa (four and six cas- es, respectively) whereas it was the preva- lent item in Asia and Oceania, in the Mid- dle East and Maghreb, and also in America (32, 22, and 21 cases, respectively). Another similarity between Asia and Oceania and the Middle East and Maghreb was the large number of national power confl icts, albeit still considerably less than in Africa. On the other hand, Africa and Asia and Oceania had a very large number of regional pre- dominance confl icts (26) \u2014 an item almost unknown in the Middle East and Maghreb (only one case). Asia and Oceania also had a large number of secession or autonomy confl icts (17 and 13 cases, respectively), similar to Europe, but in contrast to Afri- ca, the Americas, and the Middle East and Maghreb. The only analogy between Eu- rope, the Americas, and the Middle East and Maghreb was the relatively large number of interstate confl icts. Coups d\u2019\u00e9tat After 2006\u2019s two successful coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Thailand and Fiji and one attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the Philippines, only one attempted ducted violently in 2007, none of the cases being a high intensity confl ict. The same applies to territory, another interstate item, which was pursued violently in only fi ve out of 49 cases. No high-intensity confl icts concerning one or both of these two items were observed in 2007. Striking differences concerning the fre- quency of items can be discovered between the regions. In Europe, the prevalent cause for disputes was self-determination; with secession the most frequent item with 16 cases, and autonomy ranking second with 13 cases. In contrast, both internal power confl icts and confl icts over regional pre- dominance were almost unknown (two con- fl icts over national power, one over region- al predominance). This is a quite different determination can hardly be divided be- tween the confl ict parties in a way that sat- isfi es both parties. Chart 6: Global frequency of confl ict items in 2007 by intensity groups Another factor might be that many con- fl icts over resources were interstate con- fl icts, which are far less violence-prone than intrastate confl icts [Panorama: analysis in- trastate \u2013 interstate]. In fact, violence in disputes over resources occurred only in intrastate cases, with the single exception of the crisis between Uganda and DR Con- go [Uganda \u2013 DR Congo (Lake Albert)]. The lower susceptibility to violence of interstate confl icts is also illustrated by the fact that only three out of 32 confl icts over interna- tional power, an interstate item, were con- Global frequency of confl ict items in 2007 by intensity groups ",

        "[ 49 ] Introduction Today\u2019s world is characterised by more confl ict than ever before; last year 118 vio- lent confl icts wreaked destruction around the globe. Not all raged with the same fe- rocity; but they were nevertheless united by one fundamental issue: their capacity to destroy human life. As the Talmud puts it, \u201cWhoever saves one life, saves the world entire\u201d. It is this simple truth which should guide us as we enter these discussions, together with our recognition of the fundamental re- sponsibility we share to protect human life and to promote human security. Another characteristic of today\u2019s world is the vast array of information sources and tools at our disposal. But, does that capac- ity for early warning translate into early action? Too often it does not. And that is simply unacceptable in this ever more globalised and sophisticated world. EU, early warning and early action The conference on early warning and ear- ly action is part of the European Commis- sion\u2019s response. We want to use this occa- sion to look at how the EU can better react to crises and confl icts. And we want your active guidance as to the future focus of our activities. The European Union has a comprehensive range of tools at its disposal for crisis man- agement. To maximise their impact we must ensure that at every stage, from planning to the fi nal stages of implementation, Member States, Council Secretariat and Commission work closely together. We have to focus on ensuring all instruments, not only our rapid reaction programmes but also our long term development assistance, humanitarian as- sistance and ESDP rule of law, police and military missions, are carefully coordinated and complementary. This conference builds on one held here two years ago, which President Ahtisaari co- hosted with us. Since then we have launched a number of initiatives to further develop our crisis response. Certainly one of the most innovative developments over the last two years has been our new fi nancing mechanism for cri- sis management and confl ict prevention, the Instrument for Stability. Here I should pay tribute to the European Parliament for its invaluable support in ena- bling this instrument to see the light of day. It gives the EU\u2019s crisis response capacities an important boost. On the fi nancial side it more than quadruples our assistance, from \u20ac 30 to \u20ac 140 million this year alone. We have established effi cient methods for exchang- ing information with Member States about our activities via the Council's Political and Security Committee. The Stability Instrument enables us to fund a wider range of activities than ever before: on the one hand in a range of areas under the broad heading of crisis response and preparedness; and on the other under the heading of long-term trans-regional threats to stability, including non-prolifer- ation, protecting critical infrastructure and tackling major public health threats. As a result we can now respond more fl ex- ibly and rapidly to a major new political crisis or natural disaster; to shore up peace- building processes; and to ensure develop- ment needs are addressed from the start by getting children back to school and re-open- ing health and other local public services. F ROM E ARLY W ARNING TO E ARLY A CTION : D EVELOPING THE EU' S R ESPONSE TO CRISIS AND LONGER - TERM THREATS 1 Dr. Benita Ferrero-Waldner has been the European Commissioner for External Relations since 2004. She was born in 1948 in Salzburg, Austria. Dr. Ferrero- Waldner received her doctorate in law from the University of Salzburg. She has served as Austria\u2019s federal Minister for Foreign Affairs and State Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Between 1993 and 1995, she served as Deputy Chief of Protocol at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then Chef of Protocol at the Executive Offi ce of the Secretary General, United Nations Secretariat, New York. Before entering the diplomatic service, Dr. Ferrero- Waldner worked in the private sector and held a number of management positions in Europe and the United States. 1 Introduction speech held by Dr. Ferrero- Waldner at the conference \u201cFrom early warning to early action: Developing EUs response to crisis and longer-term threats\u201d, 12-13 November 2007, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium ",
        "[ 50 ] EU's crisis response mechanism To illustrate the complementarity of the EU\u2019s crisis response mechanisms, let me mention the forthcoming (ESDP) mission to Chad. The Commission and Council Sec- retariat cooperated from the beginning of the planning process, and undertook a joint information gathering mission together with civilian and military staff and the Presi- dency. The result is a package of EU and EC activities bringing to bear a wide range of EU instruments. The ESDP mission will be complemented by money from the Stabil- ity Instrument for training and equipping 850 Chadian Police Offi cers. They will then be deployed in refugee and IDP camps in Eastern Chad. We hope this will play an im- portant role in securing and stabilising the neighbourhood of Sudan/Darfur. We are also considering additional support, for example funding a population census in Chad to lay the groundwork for future elections. In Afghanistan the EU is intensifying its efforts to develop a democratic, secure and sustainable Afghan state. Central to that objective is promoting the rule of law, and the Commission has therefore been sup- porting the payment of police salaries while developing a strategic reform programme for the justice sector and a system of legal aid. All this has been carefully coordinated through joint exploratory missions of the Commission, Council Secretariat and Mem- ber States. We have also been fully involved in the EU\u2019s evolving response to the deteriorating security situation in Lebanon. Again, joint planning missions have led to a number of common projects designed to strengthen the country\u2019s security sector. We are working closely with the German government on a project for integrated border management, enabling the Lebanese authorities to better control and secure their border with Syria. And we are providing senior police experts to the Lebanese police service, building their capacity for maintaining law and order. All over the world, from Georgia to Burma/ Myanmar, from the DRC to Peru, we are work- ing to tackle ongoing crises and prevent fu- ture confl ict. An important focus of our work in the coming period will be Kosovo/a. We are engaged in intense planning activities for what we hope will be a smooth transition to its future status. Another innovative element of the Stabil- ity Instrument is the Peacebuilding Partner- ship. We are convinced that the most sus- tainable approach to resolving confl ict is to ensure all partners are involved. We also recognise the deep reserve of technical ex- pertise held by organisations such as those represented here today. We will set up a broad-based network of specialised European NGOs with expertise in early warning, confl ict prevention, peace- building, post-confl ict and post-disaster re- covery. But it also means strengthening our cooperation with Member States\u2019 aid agen- cies, the UN and other relevant organisa- tions. Some fi nancial support will be avail- able for capacity building and the roster of NGOs we establish will give us a readily ac- cessible pool of experts to rapidly mobilise support for any given situation. We are very excited by the possibility for more collaborative working practises. We hope to build upon the existing capacity amongst our implementing partners, as well as provide innovative mechanisms to deploy these skills in crisis situations. But the Stability Instrument is not the only way we have been consolidating the EU\u2019s crisis response. You may be familiar with the Barnier Report which took a thor- ough and critical look at the EU\u2019s crisis re- sponse mechanisms and offered a number of recommendations, several of which we have already begun to implement. Of particular importance to me are consular protection, about which the Commission will publish a Communication later this year, and en- hanced coordination of humanitarian aid and civil protection. I want the Commis- sion delegations to play a constructive role in these areas. In addition, we have released a Commu- nication on the EU\u2019s response to situations of fragility, looking at the specifi c require- ments of contexts where institutional ca- pacity is very limited.

        "[ 53 ] Introduction I want to thank the European Commis- sion for inviting me to speak at this time- ly conference on developing the European Union\u2019s response to crisis and longer-term threats. Finding better and more effective ways to respond to crises rapidly and coher- ently while maintaining a focus on preven- tive action is imperative. This gathering offers a unique opportu- nity for us Europeans and the many experts from around the world present here to re- fl ect on the priorities the EU should have in confl ict prevention and peacebuilding and the best methodologies and tools to support this work. In the following, I would like to say few words about some particular challenges for the EU in confl ict prevention and peace- building and to share some of my initial thoughts about the ways and means to move forward in addressing these issues. A vision of the future nature and context of EU confl ict prevention and crisis manage- ment activities is essential to inform those near-term decisions that will determine Eu- rope\u2019s long-term crisis management capa- bilities and capacities. Unless globalisation stops or goes in reverse, the world of 2025 is likely to be more diverse, more interde- pendent and even more unequal. Globali- sation will produce winners and losers, as between countries and regions, and within societies, while universal communication will make these disparities evermore appar- ent. The regions neighbouring Europe will face particular challenges. The prognosis is for tensions and strong migratory pressures in the regions around Europe at a time when it is becoming increasingly dependent on the rest of the world, especially for energy. Afghanistan: a key challenge for the European Union Afghanistan remains a key challenge for the international community. It is a mixed picture, with both progress and setbacks. On the one hand, there has been the tradition of Loya Jirga 2 , the National Assembly and stronger central government. On the other hand, old warlords remain infl uential, and political structures at the central and local levels have limited capacity. In addition, corruption permeates much of the govern- ment apparatus, and a culture of impuni- ty has continued. The economic situation in Afghanistan is still a major challenge. Despite increased development efforts, there has been limited real improvements in liv- ing conditions. The country is among the fi ve poorest in the world, the infant mortality rate is the highest in the world and the infrastructure is extremely weak. The drug economy is rapidly growing and has strong political links. This relates not only to the global drug scene, but also to the local political scene. If the Afghan government can not cope with the drug lords it will not be possible to es- tablish good governance, and effective gov- ernance is a prerequisite for successful rule by law and reconstruction. In addition, local powerbrokers see reconstruction and devel- opment as a threat. Therefore, what we do now will infl uence people\u2019s perceptions of and the level of support for the new politi- cal order, thereby determining the chanc- es it has of succeeding. The international community needs to remain committed to Afghanistan and give the country time. Fail- ure to do so would see this native land sliding backwards with disastrous consequences. Since the Taliban\u2018s fall in 2001, the EU has been a major contributor to Afghani- stan. A substantial European Commission C HALLENGES FOR THE EU IN CONFLICT PREVENTION AND PEACEBUILDING 1 Martti Ahtisaari is a former President of Finland (1994-2000) and a United Nations diplomat and mediator, noted for his international peace work. Currently he is the UN representative and mediator during the Vienna peace talks that will determine the fi nal status of Serbia\u2018s southern province, Kosovo/a (which has been under UN administration since 1999). In his proposal to the UN Security Council he has recommended supervised independence for Kosovo/a. 1 Keynote speech held by Martti Ahtisaari at the conference \u201cFrom early warning to early action: Developing EUs response to crisis and longer-term threats\u201d, 12-13 November 2007, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium 2 Loya Jirga is a forum or grand council in Afghanistan, in which, traditionally, tribal elders - Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks - have come together to settle affairs of the nation or rally behind a cause. Historically it has been used to settle inter-tribal disputes, discuss social reforms and approve a new constitution. ",
        "[ 54 ] delegation oversees an annual budget of some \u20ac 200 million in development aid, and a Special Representative is in residence. Fur- thermore, the EU launched an EU police mis- sion in Afghanistan in mid-June 2007. It is intended that EUPOL Afghanistan will con- sist of 160 personnel (increasing possibly to 190), with contributions from 17-18 EU Member States and with perhaps additional personnel from third-country states such as Canada, New Zealand and Norway. However, EU infl uence is less than it should be. Given its current toolbox of capabilities and institutional strengths, the EU should assume a stronger leader- ship role in Afghanistan. By assuming a greater coordinating role, the EU could fi ll one of the biggest gaps in the reconstruction effort. Coordination is a problem on multiple levels \u2014 among the hundreds of NGOs, government agencies and international institutions operating on the ground; among EU Member States; and between military and civilian actors. The EU could play a constructive role in all these areas. By establishing a coordination mechanism simply for its own Member States, the EU could signifi cantly reduce the well-docu- mented waste and duplication. Afghanistan, as a fragile state, has secu- rity implications far beyond its immediate neighbourhood. Building viable societies out of failed states and countries that have suf- fered from a long internal confl ict is a huge challenge recognised by a growing number of international actors. While there is an in- creasing demand for state building activities and recognition of their importance for glo- bal security, the international community is not united on what the state building agenda should include and what ought to be the means for a successful outcome. Afghanistan needs time, patience and re- lentless effort. This is not the time to give up. It is the time to remain fully engaged so that the positive developments can be built upon and produce long-term results. Even though the EU has, at theoretical and policy levels, adopted a number of important documents on fragile situations, there is still a lack of clarity and coherence on practical state building activities. Competing and sometimes confl icting agendas are an unfortunate reality and a challenge we face when dealing with fragile states like Afghanistan, which has not had a strong government for a considerable time. Further dialogue on prioritising policies and supporting local capacities in state build- ing activities is needed. The EU could also contribute to the conceptual dialogue proc- ess on priorities in state building. It would be important to bring together actors from northern and southern governments, mul- tilateral and regional organisations as well as civil society to discuss policies on state building. This way a more coherent, robust and more rapid approach could be identifi ed regarding what is essential and feasible. Tackling changes in Africa Let me now refl ect on some challenges the European Union is currently facing in its relations with Africa. Africa is changing fast. Growth is histori- cally high, investment from China is sweep- ing the continent, it has all sorts of environ- mental assets the rest of the world wants, Africans are more confi dent, and are more leveraged due to the interests of new in- vestors. But Africa remains fragile. Growth in Africa is not yet being translated into large-scale poverty reduction. The recent \u2018elections' in Nigeria provide an example of how hard-fought permanent change really is. 3 The EU must deliver aid so that it does not undermine African institutions. We have to review our assumptions about exactly what aid can do given the rapidly changing African landscape \u2014 Chinese investment has reminded us about the key role that trade and the private sector must play in Africa\u2018s development. The EU has to insure that its trade policies do not undermine its efforts in the develop- ment cooperation fi eld. Europe has repeat- edly recognised that global trade is plagued by unfair rules, and that changes could lift 3 The last elections were held in April 2007, causing uprisings and killings. ",
        "[ 55 ] millions out of poverty. However, Europe and the United States still often put their short-term trade interests before develop- ment. The principles that should underpin the EU\u2019s trading relationship with Africa should be based on a pro-poor develop- ment agenda through a mutually benefi cial partnership. We have to treat Africa as part of the glo- bal community \u2014 not as an item apart. Chi- nese and Indian engagement with Africa has helped to globalise Africa, both in re- ality and in perception. If things go wrong in Africa, it spells trouble for the rest of the world. Africa\u2018s success affects the chances of success in a wide range of global en- deavours \u2014 whether economic, political or environmental. Africa and the African Union are now at the centre of international politics and are emerging as political actors in their own right. It is becoming increasingly clear that Africa matters: as a political voice, as an economic force and as a huge source of hu- man, cultural and natural potential. In 2005, the EU presented its own Africa Strategy, putting Africa at the heart of its political agenda. However, this strategy has been widely described as unilateral and EU focused. The EU and the African Union are now keen to develop a joint strategy for the future of their partnership. The future partnership has to be based on jointly iden- tifi ed mutual and complementary interests and benefi ts. Therefore, there has been a public consultation process to develop a Joint EU-Africa Strategy. This new Joint Strategy was adopted by the Africa-EU Sum- mit in Lisbon in December 2007. The main content of the Strategy relates to strategic priorities in the area of peace and security, democratic governance and human rights, trade and regional integration and other key development issues. The strategy will face serious challenges in translating the ambitions into institutional terms, such as how to treat Africa as one. It is far from being a single entity, comprised of many different actors, each with its own interests and perceptions of security. An- other challenge is how to move away from the traditional donor\u2013recipient relationship and how to deal with overlapping initiatives from the EU. Responsibility is required from both sides, in terms of input and dialogue. In this re- spect the Joint Strategy should take into ac- count the fact that the partners are equal in terms of rights and responsibilities but not in terms of their level of integration and the availability of their fi nancial and human resources and the strategy must be imple- mented in a realistic way. \u2018Partnership\u2019 and \u2018ownership\u2019 must be defi ned in the context of this reality. Peacebuilding in Africa The creation of the African Union in 2002 4 has been an important milestone for Africa. The AU has been instrumental in establish- ing a security management system that in- cludes the Peace and Security Council. The role of the AU as the central interlocutor on the African side on peace and security issues has to be recognised. The emphasis in an EU-AU partnership should be on building the civilian capacity for confl ict resolution and mediation. The EU should share lessons identifi ed and best practices on confl ict prevention and peace mediation efforts with the AU. Creating ac- cess for the AU to international networks in the fi eld of confl ict prevention and peace mediation would also be an important EU contribution. Engaging local civil society organisations in formulating and implementing crisis man- agement as well as peacebuilding strategies should also be an important element of the partnership. Local civil society needs to be involved in the monitoring and thus needs to be funded and informed accordingly. The EU should encourage African governments at the highest political levels to create ac- tual political space for civil society. The roles of civil society actors in civilian crisis management cover the broad spectrum of engagement in early warning, prevention, mediation, monitoring, civilian peace- 4 This was the fi rst year of sessions for the assembly.

        "[ 56 ] keeping, and reconciliation. Civil society in new democracies is often unprepared for their roles and EU support will be need- ed in improving the effectiveness of civil society. The crisis in Burma/Myanmar I would like to look briefl y at one of the most acute challenges that the international society is currently facing. I\u2019m sure that the recent developments in Burma/Myanmar, and the savage crackdown of peaceful dem- onstrations, have touched all of us. Use of extreme violence can never be justifi ed as a means of sustaining order. While the situation has been an issue of major concern for all of us, it has to be kept in mind that the political stalemate in (and with) Burma/Myanmar is nothing new. The political situation has been deadlocked, mil- itary leaders have continued in power and the country has remained in international isolation since the 1988 uprising. Also, the economic situation in Burma/Myanmar con- tinues to be grim. The government is able to generate only a few per cent of its GDP in revenues, the need for civil service and institutional reform is huge and, most im- portantly, political and democratic empow- erment is a necessity for the country\u2019s so- cietal development. Authoritarian rule with failed economic policies and human rights violations have created a situation in which simple solutions do not exist. It is very clear to me that the main re- sponsibility for the welfare of any country\u2019s citizens is always with its respective govern- ment. That is no less the case with Burma/ Myanmar. However, saying this should not prevent us from assessing our own activi- ties critically. To my mind, it is always cru- cial to look in the mirror and ask oneself, is there something I should do differently? Is there something that we, as representatives of the international community, should do differently? Since the 1988 uprising and 1990 elections Western Burma/Myanmar politics have focused on economic sanc- tions and consumer boycotts against the junta. This is even more the case now, when we\u2019re desperately seeking ways to respond to the current situation in the country. As many of us know, the effectiveness and ap- propriateness of sanctions has been debated both internationally and also within Burma/ Myanmar. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not opposing the use of sanctions. But what I am asking, and asking all of us to seriously consider, is whether sanctions alone are enough to promote democratic changes in the country. Can we fi nd and identify ways and means to complement the policies we\u2019re currently taking? It\u2019s obvious that the problems of Burma/ Myanmar are located in all the different lay- ers of society. The military leadership has failed to bring about change in the country. The ethno-national realities are complex and diverse. The lack of institutionalised democracy is a risk factor that could lead the country into even more serious turmoil at any point in time; not to mention the alarming economic and humanitarian situ- ation. So how can we support the citizens of Burma/Myanmar in the development of their own home country in a manner that\u2019s peaceful and dynamic at the same time? Ending the turmoil in Burma/Myanmar would seem to require a major dialogue ini- tiative. Promoting initiatives for a dialogue between the government, democratic forc- es and ethnic groups should be one of the key priorities in European Burma/Myanmar politics, and during recent events we have heard some cautiously promising signals that give us hope that establishing a new dialogue in the country might actually be happening. If this is the case, the interna- tional society has to fi nd concrete tools to support this development. So while we are gathered in this confer- ence, which will critically assess the EU's capacity and readiness to act in the inter- national front, we have to be creative and strategic. I think that our approach and policies towards Burma/Myanmar can be a valu- able entry point to the topic of discussing the EU\u2019s crisis response capacity and ca- pability. The questions we are facing now are extremely diffi cult, but that should not prevent us from discussing and debating the issue. ",
        "[ 57 ] The European Union\u2019s role I believe fi rmly in the potential of the European Union. Eurobarometer opinion polls show the public supports an outward- looking EU \u2014 more than two-thirds favour a common European foreign policy. We have the biggest single market in the world, the largest aid budgets, tens of thousands of peacekeepers who are active all over the world and a corps of 50,000 diplomats. We have seen through the process of enlarge- ment that we can make a real difference if we show leadership and abandon our in- trospection for a serious engagement with the rest of the world. But this takes uni- ty, courage, vision and greater coherence. I think there\u2019s a real opportunity for Europe to begin shaping global events. I have con- vened, together with 50 other Europeans from across the EU, a new organisation that will promote this goal, the European Council on Foreign Relations. In order to create a vision of the future, global threats have to be understood in a holistic manner otherwise it will be impos- sible to develop the EU\u2019s response to crisis and longer term threats properly address them with targeted policies. One of the most demanding challenges is to understand fu- ture threats so that a well-grounded set of responses can be planned. Foresight should be a continuous process and not an occasional event. The European Security Strategy, adopted in 2003, has of- ten been welcomed as the fi rst important step to build a comprehensive European Se- curity Strategy. However, in the face of the ever-changing security environment there is a need to update the Security Strategy. The foundation upon which all action for confl ict resolution in the EU should be based on is the unity and coherence of the EU\u2019s foreign policy action. It is not a new demand but as it still not achieved I will repeat it once again. I anticipate that the new posi- tion of High Representative of the Union for Foreign and Security Policy will bring new impetus into the old agenda we all know so well. Establishing an External Action Serv- ice and combining the foreign policy spheres of the Commission and the Council, will avoid duplication and make foreign policy more effi cient and effective. Only if the EU speaks with one voice can it expect to be listened to and taken seriously. State building, particularly supporting the rebuilding of civilian administration, should be a key objective in our engagement with fragile states. The EU approach in fragile situations should be embedded in its over- all commitment to effective multilateralism. Fragile situations require a greater reliance on multilateral channels and calls for bet- ter coordination between the EU and the UN. Both the United Nations, through its Peacebuilding Commission and Peace Sup- port Fund, and the European Union, through its Stability Instrument, are building capac- ity for sustained engagement in countries emerging from confl ict. It is important that these instruments cre- ate synergies and share responsibility with- out overlapping activities. We have to be better aware of the im- pact of our peacebuilding and crisis man- agement activities. Third-party intervention in internal confl icts and crises is increas- ing and having various short- and long- term effects, at times unintended, on the host\u2019s society and economy. In this age of transparency and accountability, evalua- tion can neither be ignored nor avoided. Understanding the impact dimensions better would help improve the quality of opera- tions through training and planning. The EU has also reached a point in its develop- ment where the impact of crisis management and peacebuilding needs to be verifi able and quantifi able. The European Commission needs to en- gage in a solid consultation exercise with peacebuilding NGOs to identify needs and areas of cooperation, both at the thematic and geographical level. When it comes to the involvement of civil society organisa- tions in European efforts, the most promi- nent feature is the Peacebuilding Partnership that was introduced together with the Sta- bility Instrument. It offers an unprecedented opportunity to create genuine partnership. This means that we can start to develop a culture of cooperation between NGOs and the European Commission. The work of the EU would benefi t from the ",
        "[ 58 ] creation of a mediation support unit, which could assist both European institutions and Special Representatives. Mediation can be an effective instrument in bringing about peace in societies in confl ict. I am quite impressed with the work of the UN Department for Political Affairs in cre- ating a mediation support unit that is de- veloping systematic knowledge about the professional practice of mediation as well as providing support to mediators on spe- cifi c issues. An EU mediation support unit would help to build a new body of individu- als who are capable of engaging in confl ict resolution. The EU also has resources to support the work of non-state actors, creating synergies between the different tracks in mediation. We, the Crisis Management Initiative, have benefi ted from this. Capacity building by the European Commission and its partners in mediation/Track II diplomacy could be one of the key goals for crisis response in the EU through the use of the Stability Instrument. The European Union, like all the other actors, is facing challenges in its relations and actions with the changing world. As the challenges are novel and complicated the tools created to respond to these challenges should be accordingly innovative. There are great expectations of the Stability Instrument to deliver. Responding coherently and rapidly to crises while at the same time integrating crisis response into longer-term action will be a challenge. I trust that the new Stability Instrument will contain an innovative di- mension and be courageous enough to seek new methods for crisis response and confl ict resolution. ",
        "[ 59 ] Introduction We live in a context of two major and related processes. First, there is regionali- sation based on high-speed transportation and communication. This, however, comes up against cultural borders. In fact, four of these \u2018borders\u2019, or international unions, cur- rently exist: the European Union (EU), the African Union (AU), the South Asian Asso- ciation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). As I see it, there are four more to come: 1. United States of Latin America and the Caribbean, ALC ( Estados Unidos de Amer- ica Latina y el Caribe ); 2. Russian Union, RU, with autonomy for all non-Russians; 3. East Asian community, like the Shanghai Cooperative Organisation, SCO, compris- ing 50 per cent of humanity; 4. Islamic community similar to the Organ- isation of the Islamic Conference, OIC, which would be the Ummah (\u2018community\u2019 or \u2018nation\u2019) from Morocco to Mindanao. The second process at work is the rapid decline and fall of the US empire, which, if handled well, may be a blessing for the US republic just as it was for the 11 EU Member States formerly colonial powers liberated from their empires. Where is the early warning? Early warning has three components: 1. Direct violence: beyond throwing a fi rst stone. This is the capability and inten- tion proven by a general tendency to participate in wars (which is among other reasons to create hierarchies and hegemonies); 2. Structural violence: a position higher up or lower down in a hierarchy of exploi- tation\u2013repression\u2013alienation, which can either preserve or destroy the hierarchy; 3. Cultural violence: the cultural justifi cation of direct violence or structural violence. A \u2018war participation index\u2019, based on the number of wars a state has participated in, divided by the number of years the state has existed, seems to confi rm this. The top four of such an index are: 1. United States of America 0.3040 2. Israel 0.1842 3. Ottoman Empire and Turkey 0.1552 4. England and Great Britain 0.1277 The commonality of the four countries mentioned above is structural violence, both in the sense of settler colonialism within and of regional and world empire-building without. They also share cultural violence based on hard readings of Abrahamic reli- gions \u2013 hard-line Protestantism in the USA and the UK, hard-line (not Sufi sm!) Islam in the Ottoman Empire, and hard-line Zionism (not Martin Buber-esque!) in Israel. In all three cases we fi nd dualism with Manichean overtones: seeing oneself as good, oppo- nents as evil and Armageddon as the fi nal arbiter \u2014 the DMA syndrome. 2 Add to this the idea of \u2018chosen by the eternal\u2019, a sense of past and future glory and the signifi cance of past trauma suffered on the road \u2014 the CGT syndrome. 3 Both syndromes are important building blocks for deep violence. Of course, dialectically they also inspire the same syn- dromes in the other side. Today we witness this spiralling cultural escalation. Two of these empires are now gone, with Turkey as a late bloomer. For the other two, the early warning prediction is obvi- ous: came, went, gone. So what is the early action consequence? Contain the USA and Israel \u2014 is this realistic? Some think so, and most of today's violence takes place in these contexts. F ORESEEING CONFLICT 1 Johan Galtung is a sociologist and principal founder of the peace and confl ict studies discipline. He has published several books on peacebuilding and confl ict resolution. Professor Galtung is the founder of TRANSCEND \u2014 a peace and development network \u2014 as well as the International Peace Research Institute and the Journal of Peace Research. 1 Keynote speech held by Johan Galtung at the conference \u201cFrom early warning to early action: Developing EUs response to crisis and longer-term threats\u201d, 12-13 November 2007, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium 2 DMA: Dualism\u2013Manicheism\u2013Armageddon. 3 CGT: Chosenness\u2013Glory\u2013Trauma.

        "[ 60 ] Hierarchies produce intractable confl icts. Peace assumes a high level of equity, or an \u2018equiarchy\u2019. The road to peace is paved with acceptance of the other(s) as an equal part- ner in negotiation and dialogue. But if one or more of them is informed by a highly ineq- uitable structure sustained by an entrenched culture, then peace by peaceful means be- comes more diffi cult. A cornerstone of the EU approach is to promote a culture of human rights and dem- ocratic structures. These are excellent \u2014 bene \u2014 per se. But the assumption that peace fol- lows in their wake is based on a logical fal- lacy with serious consequences. Violence in general, and war in particular, is a relation between two or more states. So is peace. But democracy and human rights may be properties of none, one or more of them, and may be very good for inner- peace. Make democracy a relation, like in a regional, or even global (the United Nations or national parliaments) relation based on free and fair elections. We are in the inter- state, inter-nation peace business. Democ- racy does not steer major parties to crisis and violence today, but what about the day after tomorrow? Where is the early action? What is our crisis/threat response? Another kind of relation worth working on is an unresolved confl ict between parties. This is the fi re, and violence is the smoke. Confl ict is as human as the body, mind and spirit. \u2018Confl ict prevention\u2019 is meaningless, but \u2018violence prevention\u2019 is certainly not. There is no \u2018post-confl ict\u2019, but hopefully there is a \u2018post-violence\u2019. We must get out of the Anglo-American view of confl ict as a clash of persons, groups or parties, and see confl ict as a clash of goals. Seeing confl ict as a clash of goals makes it a problem to be solved by creating a re- ality whereby legitimate goals can be ac- commodated and become compatible. Seeing confl ict as a clash of parties usually implies seeing one or more of them as parties to be controlled \u2014 often violently. Concepts matter. TRANSCEND uses one-to-one dialogues with all parties. Mediation means mapping confl icts (parties\u2013goals\u2013clashes), testing goals for legitimacy and bridging legitimate goals. This calls for empathy, nonviolence and crea- tivity. Conciliation means acknowledging past wrongs, elaborating how and why, and then defi ning a future together. When you enact in the present, you form an image with the parties \u2014 a vision of a compelling future \u2014 and are sensitive to their traumas and the glories of their past. You are creative. This is more easily said than done, so let us explore fi ve cases of mediation and fi ve cases of conciliation, based on our own expe- riences. For more details, see www.transcend- nordic.org and our UN manuals for TRAN- SCEND and the Sabona approaches. 4 What would peace in the Middle East, be- tween Israel and its neighbours, look like? It would look much like the European Com- munity imagined by two French statesmen whom we now honour for their creativity. They said, \u2018Nazi Germany has been so atro- cious that it has to be a member of the fam- ily\u2019. Few saw it that way at the time; moreo- ver, the European family did not exist then except as a wartime alliance. They painted a compelling future on the wall, a commu- nity of six, invoking the future to overcome the past and even the present. In the end it stuck and has been an astounding success, inviting us all here and now to continue the good work. Peace could look like a Middle East com- munity of six: Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine (fully recognised), Egypt and an Israel willing to contract to something like its 4 June 1967 borders in exchange for secu- rity through peace. The opposite would be a non-starter. Others, like Turkey and Cyprus, might join, maybe in an Eastern Mediterra- nean community. Israel might develop very tight EU relations and Arab countries could join the Organisation of the Islamic Com- munity. And yet there could be a Middle East community with open borders, rights and obligations. 4 Sabona is a group working on facilitating professor Johan Galtung\u2019s confl ict concepts. ",
        "[ 61 ] The six states in the Treaty of Rome could serve as a model, not only as a mediator. Open the archives and invite the countries concerned to share their concerns, while at the same time NGOs continue to stimulate dialogue. This scheme would need work both from the bottom and the top, with open di- alogue all around. Western Europe man- aged to digest Germany. Western Asia and the eastern Mediterranean can manage the same with a more reasonable, more mod- est Israel. Right now we are living in the shadow of a major US-Iran nuclear war. How do we solve this problem? This is not a border problem but a confl ict rooted in the past. It needs acknowledgment by the United States and the UK of the wrongs committed by the CIA and MI6 in 1953, which deposed a legiti- mate prime minister and initiated 25 years of dictatorship. This has the possibility of triggering Sura 8:61 in the Qur\u2019an: when your enemy inclines toward peace you shall do the same. Iran did so in both 2001 and 2003 but there was no response. Nonethe- less, peace is located in this direction, and the nuclear issue would dissolve. What is the joint future? Imagine the world\u2019s biggest oil consum- er and potentially biggest oil producer join together for large-scale, non-fossil fuel projects! Maybe this could be fi nanced by Norway\u2019s big oil fund rather than using a fi fth of it to fi nance the Iraq war? Is this un- realistic? On the contrary: the lack of real- ism is with the so-called realists. The world would rejoice. But it would take moral cour- age. And it might take some history and textbook revisionism on both sides, which could build on the work of the masters of this, the Germans, some ten years after con- fl ict resolution was built into the Treaty of Rome. And what about Iraq? We need to build on past successes. The European Commis- sion, for example, was an internal inter-state success. So was German textbook revision, which created good relations with the 25 in- vaded countries by today's map and the three peoples exposed to genocide: Jews, Sinta- Roma 5 and Russians. The Helsinki Confer- ence on Security and Cooperation in Europe was also a success. Why not make a Confer- ence for Security and Cooperation in West Asia, fi nanced by the EU? Kurdistan would also have to be on this agenda \u2014 how can you have a confederation of four autonomies without drawing new borders? And what about the artifi cial birth of Iraq, beginning in 1916? It lingered somewhere between federation and confederation while under the protection of the United Nations Security Council and Organisation of the Islamic Conference. We have a list of Western aggressions against Muslim countries. We have names, years and particularly traumatic events. There is France attacking Egypt, and England Mysore, in 1798, 6 Italy bombing bases in Libya in 1911, 7 and Spain-Franco- Xauen in 1925. 8 The perpetrator suffers from amnesia, but the victim never forgets. But what are the motives? Resources no doubt, with well-rewarded autocracies to guarantee delivery. There is also a con- tinuation of the Crusades to subvert and convert Islam. (Italy and Spain, please take note). With luck there may be some serious signs of acknowledgment well before 2011 and 2025 \u2014 and not simply to stay out of trouble because it is the right thing to do. True greatness also includes the acknowledg- ment of one\u2019s own smallness. This leads us to the US/Western world\u2019s \u2018War on Terror\u2019, a complex confl ict with acts of war like 9/11 in New York and Wash- ington, D.C., 7/7 in London and 11M[arch] in Madrid, and massive killing and tor- ture in Iraq and Afghanistan. Spain, un- der Prime Minister Zapatero, handled 11M masterfully. Morocco's ambassador was not expelled, nor was Rabat bombed as 5 Sinta is a sub-group of the Romany people. 6 The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-1799) was a war in South India between the Kingdom of Mysore and the British East India Company. 7 During the Libyan war between Italy and the Ottoman Empire. 8 Americans troops under French and Spanish command bombed Xuaen in 1925 causing a large number of causalities. ",
        "[ 62 ] somebody else might have done. Zapatero travelled to Rabat for top-level dialogue and also no doubt for talks about Ceuta\u2013Melilla 9 (here a \u2018Hong Kong\u2019 solution might have been useful). In October 2005 Zapatero le- galised nearly half a million illegal Moroc- cans in Spain, pulled Spanish troops out of Iraq and launched an \u2018Alliance of Civilisa- tions\u2019. Brilliant! Which brings up Sykes and Picot, British and French diplomats respectively, who in 1916 promised the Arabs independence if they fought and helped overthrow the Otto- man Turks. They so did but were colonised: Iraq and Palestine for England and Syria and Lebanon for France. Rulers (leaders) used rul- ers (straight edges) to defi ne their artifi cial entities. Maybe an Anglo-French-Arab his- tory book about 1916 is overdue? It is never too late. Arab school children live this trau- ma even if the English and French do not, and not all wrongs come from Washington. Let us move from the West\u2013Christian/Ar- ab\u2013Muslim theatre to the Balkans. Here there is the situation in Kosovo/a, where the Serbs have \u2018clear historical legitimacy\u2019 in the terri- tory they call \u2018Kosovo\u2019, while the Albanians have \u2018clear self-determination, democratic and historical legitimacy\u2019 in the same piece of territory they call \u2018Kosova\u2019. Both status quo as a part of Serbia, and independence as a unitary state, are clearly untenable and will lead to endless violence. Division is untena- ble for at least two reasons: viability and the right of all to consider Kosovo/a theirs with free travel and interaction. What is the solu- tion? An independent, federal Kosovo/a, with autonomous Serbian cantons, in a confedera- tion with Serbia and Albania. Of course, ma- jority-based self-determination for Kosovo/a sets a precedent for Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere. But then, why not? There is an Ottoman shadow over the re- gion, which brings us to Turkey\u2013Armenia and the question of conciliation. The confl ict seems to have been trilateral with the Kurds being promised freedom if they would do the Turks\u2019 dirty work. They did, but got no free- dom. The Anglo-French/Sykes\u2013Picot formula, a part of the same zeitgeist, probably passes as an example of the art of statesmanship. 10 But does that exonerate the Turks? No, but it provides a context. Imagine unconditional acknowledgment implies unconditional com- pensation \u2014 could that stand in the way? Of course. How about building the joint future of neighbours around the contested mountain Ararat? How about making Ararat a \u2018Moun- tain of World Peace\u2019, not only for the three Abrahamic religions, but for humanity? Un- der joint Turkish\u2013Armenian administration, UN aegis and paid by the EU? Approach- ing the past via the future \u2013 maybe also for Burma/Myanmar? Why not open the EU for Turkey, Arme- nia and the Caucasian community? There is conciliation work to be done, as with former- ly colonial countries and many EU charter members. But conciliation without confl ict solution \u2014 \u00e0 la shake hands, be good friends \u2014 is only pacifi cation. This is like a ceasefi re or money for development: it may buy time before violence erupts again. All roads to peace pass through deep confl ict resolution. And price stabilisation in return for keeping the EU\u2013ACP division of labour is shallow. The East Asian formula was industrialisation with protection and welfare state. Deeper transformation is needed. The EU-ACP structural confl ict has an im- portant dimension: who plans whom? MDCs 11 love to plan LDCs, 12 and the EU the ACP, down to micro-management, as a part of ODA. 13 Imagine the EU inviting the ACP or the whole former Third World (AU + OIC + SAARC + ASEAN + SCO + ALC) to advise the EU and half a billion \u2018EUians\u2019? Invite experts, host dialogues with their nationals 9 Ceuta and Melilla, on North Africa\u2018s Mediterranean coast, came under Spanish control around 500 years ago. Spain claims the urban enclaves are integral parts of Spain. They are surrounded by Morocco, which views the Spanish presence as anachronistic and claims sovereignty. 10 The 1916 Sykes-Picot-Sazanov Agreement, between the governments of Britain and France, with the assent of Russia, defi ned their respective spheres of infl uence and control in west Asia after the expected downfall of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. 11 MDC: most-developed-countries. 12 LCD: least-developed-countries. 13 Offi cial Development Assistance (ODA) is a category of development aid.

        "[ 63 ] in EU diaspora, elicit good ideas. Symmetry, reciprocity. The EU Commission has little or no hesitation dispensing advice \u2014 but is it willing to receive any? The EU currently faces a very important di- lemma: the civilian peacekeeping favoured by the Commission or the military version with rapid deployment favoured by the Council? The latter might like to fi ll the gap left be- hind when the USA withdraws troops, like the British did East of Suez in 1965. The Third World, the chosen battlefi eld like Orwell\u2019s Malabar Coast, 14 might have some advice to offer about taming the forces favouring in- terventions and enhancing those favouring creative solutions. Maybe the Chinese could offer some ad- vice from among that which they addressed to themselves at the 17th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party? And India might offer some advice about high electoral par- ticipation in a country with well above a billion population to one with less than half of that. The world does not need a new em- pire but rather inter-regional structures for joint planning. As the South African foreign minister expressed at a conference (with the United States and Israel eloquently absent) on the issue of colonialism, \u2018this is not about money or compensation but about dignity\u2019. How is dignity promoted? By perpetrators acknowl- edging, elaborating and designing new ways of entering the future together. Dignity is a relation with symmetry, reci- procity and equity. One approach, building on the UNESCO German\u2013Polish experience and the German approach in general, would be to invite a major joint history project on colonialism, with slavery included. This would also focus on the Arab\u2013Muslim world and others. All of these cases illustrate one point: to contribute something to solving big problems you must think big thoughts. Small thoughts will do for small problems, like standardisa- tion of car bumpers. Check your thoughts, and let them grow with the people concerned. This can be done better by NGOs in the fi eld than by diplomats in sterile rooms with lin- ear agendas. The Track I government vs. Track II civ- il society with NGOs, local authorities, the young and women, is problematic. Track I often becomes \u2018Track minus I\u2019, hoping that Track II can weigh in at plus I. The strength of civil society is in direct contact \u2014 high on empathy and less inclined to violence. Having no hammer the world looks less like a nail. But creativity remains a crucial commodity. Its scarcity among dip- lomats geared toward correct process does not guarantee its presence in civil society \u2014 except for artists, engineers, architects, etc. Both can be trained in, say, non-West- ern ho\u2018o ponopono 15 , gacaca 16 and shir 17 conciliation approaches and then work hand in hand. There is much to learn. The civil society can do all three, peace- making, peacebuilding, peacekeeping. The non-governments can probably do it better than the governments. Thus, civil society can make 10,000 dialogues blossom, within and among confl ict parties, fi nd out where the shoes pinch and what future society, re- gion, world they want to live in \u2014 like what Middle East, what Kosovo/a. They can let all that information fl ow together and watch the \u2018GNIP\u2019, the gross national idea product, grow. Something will emerge; peace may be made. Governments may clinch the deal. But peace also has to be built. Webs of togetherness must be woven; humanis- ing where there has been dehumanisa- tion, and depolarising where there has been polarisation. And peace has to be kept, by non-violent peace forces, which are 14 Reference to George Orwell\u2019s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four 15 Ho'o ponopono means \"to make right\" and is a Polynesian ritual for forgiveness and clearing of past hurts. 16 Literally meaning \u201cjudgment on the grass\u201d in Kirwanda.

What is striking is not just how old many of them are, but also the conditions in which they are stored as they fl out all safety standards. The Stability Instrument could be used for monitoring and destroying surplus weapons. You also mapped out the Greens\u2019 new se- curity strategy for Europe. Does the EU need to create a European Army as some politi- cians are openly calling for? In the controversy about \u2018human secu- rity\u2019 three things have gone wrong. First, the concept of \u2018human security\u2019 has been stretched so far as to even legitimise, for example, the deployment of armed forces to secure supplies of fossil fuels. Second, as a result of this \u2013 justly criticised \u2013 milita- risation of \u2018human security\u2019, large sections of the peace movement have now rejected their own concept and concern themselves exclusively with civilian instruments. Third, we are being diverted from the need to ex- amine how to obtain more security with less military involvement via the controlled har- monisation of European armed forces. The Greens are countering the milita- risation effort with reinforcement of the civilian instruments of the European Secu- rity and Defence Policy, disarmament, and clude civilian measures against the prolif- eration of small arms and light weapons, as well as clearance and stockpile destruc- tion of landmines and duds. It also includes programmes to demobilise and reintegrate former combatants and child soldiers. More- over, the instrument allows for the particular concerns of women in all fi elds of action. In addition, the instrument features a bind- ing declaration that guarantees the respect for human rights in Europe's fi ght against terrorism. The most prominent feature of the Sta- bility Instrument is the Peacebuilding Part- nership. This provides for the development of a representative network of NGOs en- gaged in confl ict prevention, early warning, peacebuilding and post-confl ict operations. The Peacebuilding Partnership also allows for direct fi nancial support for regional or- ganisations and networks to improve their capabilities. In addition, it envisages Euro- pean Commission contact and coordination offi ces, both in Brussels and on the ground that are responsible for providing short- term administrative and logistic assistance. Right now we are revising the Peacebuilding Partnership Action Plan, as more and more NGOs hear about this instrument and could support it. And there are other areas that need spe- cial attention, for instance the situation of What are your expectations concerning the difference that the new Stability In- strument can make in the EU\u2019s response to crise worldwide? I am fully aware that the new legal provi- sions still have to be implemented and that there is still much that needs to be done in terms of the EU\u2019s capabilities and per- formance. This is especially the case when it comes to the involvement of civil society organisations in the implementation and in the evaluation of the Stability Instrument. Together with six other instruments, this initiative represents the legal and fi nancial basis of the EU's common foreign policy ac- tivities. With its \u20ac 2 billion budget for 2007- 2013 1 , the Stability Instrument signifi cantly strengthens the EU's capacity for civilian intervention. Using a single legal method, the EU will be able to react to crises outside its borders in a rapid, fl exible and coherent way potentialy followed by a cooperation based on other EU aid mechanisms. Concerning both short-term and long-term measures, the Stability Instrument provides for fi nancial and technical support for civil- ian actions of international and regional or- ganisations, state actors as well as NGOs. What are the most important elements of the Stability Instrument in concrete terms? Some overdue and promising features in- H UMAN SECURITY IS THE KEY FACTOR I NTERVIEW WITH A NGELIKA B EER Angelika Beer has been a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament since 2004.

        "[ 66 ] harmonisation of the armed forces in Europe. We in the Greens are campaigning for a European peace policy that responds to the issues of a fair distribution of resources and fair access on a global scale; pleas for urgent global disarmament efforts, fi rst and foremost with regard to nuclear and other mass destruction arms; and puts the fi ght against expanding organised crime as one of the EU\u2019s top priorities. What are the core elements of your secu- rity proposal? European security policy must always be a human rights policy, too. Human rights are universal. Peacekeeping and peace-enforce- ment operations, and also the fi ght against international terrorism, can succeed only if forces deployed under the EU fl ag respect the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and international humanitarian law absolutely. With regard to human rights, many prob- lems have root causes in other policy ar- eas as well. Current European foreign trade, agricultural and fi sheries policies deprive millions of people in developing countries of their basis of life and drive them to mi- gration. Confl icts over the distribution of water, energy sources and other resources threaten political stability in many regions worldwide. The trade and agricultural pol- icy of the EU should be reformed to ensure fair market conditions for producers and farmers from developing countries and in- creased standards of living to remove causes for confl ict. It is not acceptable that there exist differ- ent standards of human rights within the EU. We cannot explain to other countries world- wide why the Charter of Fundamental Rights does not apply to all European citizens. The EU is very much concerned about a sustainable supply of energy and a diversi- fi cation of its energy sources. When it comes to nuclear energy, do you see the nuclear is- sue as a threat to Europe\u2019s security? Energy policy must be a policy for peace. As well as responding to concerns about the security of energy supply, our strategy of moving away from oil and gas removes the cause of many confl icts. Our understanding of \u2018human security\u2019 fi rmly rejects the deploy- ment of armed forces to safeguard raw mate- rials. We Greens reject the revival of nuclear power as a replacement for oil and gas \u2014 one of the reasons being the lessons learnt from the nuclear catastrophe in Chernobyl. Nuclear power always has a dual purpose. After all, civilian and military use are in- separable. The fi ght against proliferation cannot succeed while nuclear power is be- ing used \u2014 a fact illustrated by the nuclear dispute with Iran. This means that renewable energy sources are not only necessary for the environment, they also increase security, as they tackle the causes of confl icts over fossil resources. Because of their decentralised net- works renewables also present less potential for attacks, for example by terrorists. Invest- ment in renewable energy sources is invest- ment in more security and stability, and thus investment in peace. We would like to see the EU promoting and providing renewable technologies in developing countries at low cost or for free. EU accession and the process towards membership is considered to be an extreme- ly effective peace tool for the EU. What will Europe\u2019s current enlargement fatigue mean for its security? The accession perspective, currently ben- efi ting the Western Balkan countries and Turkey is one of the most powerful security policy instruments at Europe\u2019s disposal. The prospect of joining the EU gives our neigh- bours a unique boost for democratisation and modernisation. However, this will materialise only if the EU advocates its founding values self-confi dently and if it acts credibly in its negotiation strategy. The situation in the Balkans, ravaged by civil war and political instability, is a particu- larly vivid illustration of the extent to which the prospect of EU accession has given these countries the courage to carry out reforms and the vision of a common European future. By continuing to hold out this prospect of accession on the one hand, and strengthen- ing its neighbourhood policy on the other while recognising cultural differences as an asset, the EU can provide a decisive boost for democracy and human rights in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in particular.

        "[ 69 ] we can connect our short-term action with long-term cooperation aid, or with EU-led civil military operations. Can you give some examples of projects carried out with the Instrument for Stability? For example, in Guinea-Bissau we are implementing a Security Sector Reform project which aims at achieving a reform of the security sector, preparing the ground for major EDF activities, and possible ac- tivities by other donors in the near future. The project assists the government in the short term in the demobilisation and re- integration of former war combatants. This specifi c IfS project prepares the ground and facilitates the success for a long-term strategy to stabilize the political and eco- nomic situation and to fi ght the traffi c of cocaine towards Europe. In Afghanistan we are enhancing the work carried out by EUPOL, which supports the Afghan police, by reforming the judicial sector through the IfS. In Lebanon, after the clashes be- tween the Lebanese army and the jihadist militants of Fatah al-Islam in 2007, we are working to form a planning committee for the reconstruction of the Nahr el Bared refugee camp and at the same time we are removing 500 000 m\u00b3 of rubble; all this in order to prepare the long-term rehabilita- overwhelming response worldwide, but this response was uncoordinated, often chaotic and ended up being criticized in an impor- tant ICRC (International Red Cross) report. In Europe we felt we were obliged to lead the resulting debate. For this reason, to- gether with President Ahtisaari we launched in 2005 a fi rst major conference on the en- hancement of European Crisis Response. Eu- rope had to respond to these challenges in new ways. One of the most important things we had understood between 2001 and 2005 was that we had to integrate the full range of instruments as well as all available fi nan- cial, human and technical resources. Coher- ence in the implementation of our resources became of paramount importance. Since then, we have made signifi cant efforts to enhance the cooperation between the vari- ous institutions in Brussels dealing with cri- sis response, notably the Commission, the Parliament, the EU Military Staff, the Joint Situation Centre and Council Policy Unit. Most of these links are now operational and we have a new and dynamic tool: the Instru- ment for Stability. The Instrument for Stability is a fi nancing mechanism which \u2013 because of its structure and size \u2013 can provide fl exibility, width and coherence to our action. We can implement a wider gamut of types of interventions and From an historical perspective what has the Commission learnt in the past 7 years in the fi eld of Crisis Response? When we watch on the media the dramat- ic images of the crises in China, Pakistan, Congo, Burma, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Afghani- stan, and when we think that so many other countries are going through a crisis without similar levels of attention from the public opinion, one could really wonder if the con- struction of peace, or \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d are not forms of wishful thinking. However, we are fully aware that we also have a political and moral duty to try eve- rything to save lives, to transform confl icts that everyone considers as insoluble, in- tractable. The challenge we face is excep- tional, but so are the resources available in Europe. Our recent history shows that we have tried to use these resources intelligently. In 2001, the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM), the precursor of the Instrument for Stability, provided an initial contribution to the proc- ess of confl ict prevention and crisis response at European level: there were at that time (and there still are unfortunately) more than 100 political confl icts around the world. The real change did not occur until the 2004 tsunami.

Also operating within the Crisis Platform Directorate is our Crisis Room, which maintains for a user commu- nity of more than 1000 offi cials the Tar\u00eeqa open source intelligence system for early warning and risk assessment. Finally, I should mention our operation- al links with 135 EC Delegations on the ground, with almost 5000 offi cials and a continuous stream of political reports on the situations unfolding on the ground. The challenge today for every diplomatic com- munity is to modernize, and to have access to better, more qualifi ed open source intel- ligence in support to bilateral or multilat- eral diplomatic activities. Is information, then, the key factor to de- velop a more reliable network of early warn- ing resources? Yes, but it is not as simple as it might seem. There are a large number of people who witness confl ict in the making, and we need to learn how to connect these people better, and draw on their knowledge and insights. Even with an abundance of infor- mation, there is often a gap between what we know and what we digest and put into action. Doing something at European level to address these \u201cmissing links\u201d is crucial. supporting through the IfS civilian activi- ties (e.g. training of the police, humanitar- ian aid, development of the local economy), alongside EUFOR CHAD, a military mission launched by the EU. The military and the civilian activities are taking place in the same geographical area and complement each other, but follow different chains of command. How would you explain the concept of \u2018early warning to early action\u2019? Moving from early warning to early ac- tion is modern crisis response. Confl icts ig- nite quickly and responses need to be com- prehensive and united in order to address them. Recently there has been an evolving public discourse concerning crisis response. Often the international community is tak- en aback by sudden outbreaks of violent events, particularly in Africa. The term \u2018for- gotten wars\u2019 has become commonplace. Thanks to the abundance of information that we can obtain from open sources, we have today the possibility of taking deci- sions with a much better situation aware- ness. The European Commission contributes to this information-gathering through its Crisis Platform Directorate. This directorate hosts one of the \u201cnodes\u201d of the \u201cCOREU Network\u201d (CORrespondance EUrop\u00e9enne), which is the EU communication infrastruc- tion of the area and the stabilization of the province of Lebanon that our longer-term reconstruction programme will assist. How can the EU better coordinate its ef- forts in the context of continuously chang- ing confl icts? We need to make use of networks of com- munity actors to match the specifi c context and needs. This means honing in-country capacities. We are also increasingly re- sponding to crises with new approaches; for example, better cooperation and coordi- nation between civilian and military tools. This approach has become unavoidable. Can you explain how the civilian and military component integrate in a crisis situation? When there is a crisis requiring a form of military presence, the Member States have been able to agree unanimously to lend some of their national military units for joint EU military operations. This has happened on a few occasions, but in peacekeeping functions rather than com- bat functions. What the Commission can rapidly of- fer in this context are the implementation models and the funds for activities that complement what is being carried out by the military component.

Aceh illustrates well how the EU can add value and combine different kinds of actors and instruments coherently. Even though our tools remain subject to administrative pro- cedures, we have the fl exibility to do things faster now than in previous years. Looking to the future, what are the key challenges? Concerning the challenges, I think it is important to mention the issue of energy security. Energy today is increasingly being used as a political weapon. There is a re- surgence of energy nationalism and re-na- tionalisation programmes among a number of producer countries, a deterioration of governance principles in the management of those resources, aggressive and non- transparent energy policies from certain important consuming countries and \u2013 last, but not least \u2013 an absolute need to fi ght climate change. It is clear to everyone how these factors are already affecting the security situation of many countries around the world. After all, nearly every crisis has relevance for Europe. Just look at the growing inter- national communities living in all major European cities: instability in the Middle East, or in Africa or in South Asia, infl u- ences \u2013 sometimes directly \u2013 the evolution and the stability of these diaspora commu- nities living in our cities. On a broader level, the EU has a number of tools available to stabilise potentially com- plicated global situations. Trade sanctions, for example. Yes, there is an array of tools availa- ble: joint statements, common positions of Member States, protocols, partnerships and agreements. Trade sanctions by the EU are often the last resort. It is important that all these tools play together. Specifi - cally, our crisis platform has the ambition of bringing together a variety of crisis re- sponse tools. In Aceh 1 , for example, there was a rare combination of factors which fell into place in the right moment. After the tsunami the situation ripened locally for peace talks but external facilitation was needed. We were able to fulfi l this role. At the same time, in order to underpin the Aceh peace agreement, there was the need for a neutral monitoring role. So there was a window of opportunity which opened the way for 1 After the 2004 tsunami which hit the coastline of Aceh particularly hard, the rebels and the government agreed to peace talks. It resulted in a peace agreement, ending more than 30 years of confl ict. ",

        "[ 73 ] towards a political end, otherwise the tool becomes the policy. If the important criterion is to say that you are the biggest donor, then that is a policy and no longer a tool. Your assistance in a confl ict needs to promote the resolution of the confl ict. Once external sup- port stops doing that one should review the tools, and not question the policy. What is needed to make real progress in the Middle East? For a confl ict to be resolved the fi rst con- dition is that the parties want to resolve it. If people want to fi ght there is very little third parties can do. It is only when they signal a desire to get out of their confl ict and they ask for a mediator, a third party or for any other kind of external assistance, that ex- ternal mediation can start doing something. Numerous studies have shown that in the absence of a real process towards the resolu- tion of a confl ict, external assistance tends to prolong the confl ict or at least tends not to give the parties involved any reason to end the confl ict. That is true in the case of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian confl ict as well as in any other confl ict in the world. How do you assess the results of the An- napolis Conference? 1 The main goal of the Annapolis Confer- ence was to launch real negotiations to end with EU engagement. What we Europeans have been doing in the last few years when the confl ict has been escalating, has been to compensate for the humanitarian conse- quences in the Palestinian population. So, to a large extent, it has been at work on the symptoms, not on the causes. After the Oslo Agreement, and being in the wake of a proc- ess, our assistance was successful because the Europeans in general were responsible for a part of the institution building and for a part of the development of economic structures. But once the parties decide to fi ght there is little one can do. You cannot replace the par- ties to the confl ict or try to come up with any substitutes for their action. I am not against humanitarian assistance at all. It has always been part of the EU\u2019s values \u2014 be it the case of Palestinian refugees or in many other ar- eas of the world \u2014 to be among the most generous and among the fi rst to respond. However, I always had misgivings about it because its value is to respond to immedi- ate humanitarian need and it does not help to resolve a confl ict. It is clearly a moral di- lemma, but at the same time morality is only one dimension of foreign policy. We should have a better system for as- sessing the impact of what we do in terms of assistance. Here I come back to the idea of being a political player: you use your tools What is the role of the European Union in trying to make progress for peace in the Mid- dle East? Is it a player or mainly a payer, es- pecially in comparison to US engagement? The Europeans are the fi rst to be respon- sible for giving such a wrong impression. If they have been payers then it is only because they have not always shown the same co- herence and unity in pursuing the political goals or the political role they want to play. Europeans have de facto always been politi- cal players: it is only that the nature of Eu- ropean external action is different from the foreign policy of a national government. Without the United States nothing can happen, but it is not only the USA who can move things forward. The Europeans tend to understate their involvement, and the EU is an abstraction: it is a collection of gov- ernments who can express a strong political will to act together or express a weak po- litical will to do so. Some European coun- tries are extremely focused and interested in the problems of the Middle East, some are less. But generally speaking, the stronger the EU's common interest in this confl ict, the more effective the EU can act in its ex- ternal policies. Has external assistance helped to move the Middle East peace process forward? Not really, no. That's not only the case A SSISTANCE IN CONFLICT MUST PROMOTE RESOLUTION I NTERVIEW WITH M ARC O TTE Marc Otte is the European Union\u2019s Special Representative for the Middle East peace process.

        "[ 74 ] ians should agree to it and end violence. But unfortunately Fatah and Hamas have not given up the idea of fi ghting each other. We already have a state within a state. In Gaza, Hamas controls everything. They control the territory, they control the life of the people and it is not a law-abiding leadership. Life is not happy for the Palestin- ians, especially for people in Gaza. Never- theless, they continue to support the idea of a negotiated solution, and they are scepti- cal about what could happen after the An- napolis peace conference. It will have to be demonstrated to the Palestinians that the present situation is a more promising one than just getting on with life. Is the extremely complex situation in the Middle East an unsolvable confl ict? It is all relative. As John Maynard Keynes used to say: in the long-term we will all be dead. The confl ict has been already lasted 60 years now; peace deals that Israel has con- cluded with some of their neighbours have not been particularly warm. But one can see similar situations in other parts of the world. It often needs an awful lot of time. Will the Lisbon Treaty change anything in the EU\u2019s power to infl uence the Middle East peace process? In principle, these new institutional ar- rangements that are planned will help us improve the EU\u2019s external action and make it more effi cient. But it is too early to say whether this will help us solve a certain confl ict. that they have a reason to do it. I can give a very long list of reasons why it is not a good time to start a negotiating process and why it will not work. It is not the perfect time. But the real question is what would be the cost of failure? What is the cost of doing noth- ing in the present situation? In this confl ict, but also in the region, maybe that is one of the reasons why people start to refl ect these days. There is a convergence of interests to start working in a more positive way towards something that is more tangible instead of continuing with some sort of crisis man- agement that has been going on for several years. So, a weakness of leadership is only a relative notion. The cost of failure is the much more important consideration. How can Hamas and Fatah move closer together? It is the same thing as with the Israelis and the Palestinians: they have to want to come together. What can outsiders do? It is a mat- ter for the Arabs. To the extent that Syria is sponsoring the terrorist activities of Hamas, or at least letting them act or hosting their leadership, they could use their authority to stop it. But if Fatah and Hamas have to work together they have to fi nd common ground. It is very diffi cult because they fi ght for two different models of society. But national uni- ty is the only way that the Palestinians can achieve their national goals. However, it is not the fi rst time that this has happened in a national liberation movement. I see it as mainly an Arab issue. The Arab League is offering a peace initiative and all Palestin- the confl ict. This has been achieved. Both parties agreed, in a joint declaration, on the framework of these negotiations. Now we have a table of content, a timeline, a meth- odology and a monitor. This is already a very good outcome. Annapolis was not about ending the con- fl ict, but about starting something. Contra- ry to the last peace talks in Camp David in 2001, which were supposed to be the end of a process, this is the beginning of a process where people will start to solve the confl ict. First it will involve the Israelis and the Pal- estinians, and maybe at a second, later stage the Arabs in general. The conference was a success because everybody has accepted that it was held and more than 40 countries endorsed the joint declaration. Among those were many Arab states that do not yet have diplomatic ties with Israel. The outcome of Annapolis must now be translated into an effi cient follow-up. This has to include productive negotiations and real international support to establish a two- state-solution, which means creating a Pal- estinian state that has the capacity to run itself. For these reasons and because there is already a lot of pledging for that kind of support, Annapolis is a success because it has given that kind of momentum. How do you see the current political weak- ness of the leaders on both sides? Apparently when they are too strong they are too strong to negotiate; when they are weak they are too weak to negotiate. The fact that people are coming to Annapolis shows ",

The rise of Iran has become the main strategic challenge \u2014 which was facilitat- ed by the disappearance of Iraq as an Arab shield vis-\u00e0-vis Iran \u2014 leading to an ideo- logical confrontation in the region and the rise of non-state actors, which have become strategic threats.

        "[ 77 ] Introduction Women\u2019s organisations are playing an increasingly important role in non-violent confl ict resolution. They are frequently the fi rst to take the risks necessary to promote dialogue across divided communities and move towards reconciliation. This works ranges from small local initiatives which often involve an income-generating com- ponent. One example of this is a caf\u00e9 and pastry shop that women have organised in an ethnically divided town in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Situated on the unoffi cial bor- der that separates the two communities, the caf\u00e9 and pastry shop is the only safe place within miles where members from the dif- ferent communities can meet and talk with each other. It was started by Croat, Serb and Bosnian women together, as a way to both provide employment for women and to help heal ethnic enmity. The women also collect the names and addresses of possible return- ees from the \u2018wrong\u2019 ethnic group, and help provide returnees with practical necessities such as tools and milk cows. 1 Women\u2019s work for dialogue also reaches to the highest political levels. The North- ern Ireland Women\u2019s Coalition (NIWC), after mobilising broad cross-community support, played a key role in the talks leading up to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and conducted a successful door-to-door elec- tion campaign that sent two members to the Northern Ireland Assembly. In a radical de- parture from partisan politics, the NIWC has refused to take a stand on issues such as a constitution for Northern Ireland, emphasiz- ing instead the need for inclusive dialogue and decision-making. 2 The Liberian Women\u2019s Initiative (LWI) like- wise helped to transform a previously male- dominated political process by demanding a voice at the 1994 Accra Clarifi cations Con- ference. By insisting that all parties disarm before the election, by publishing lists of women qualifi ed to take up positions in gov- ernment ministries if appointed, and by con- ducting an energetic voter education pro- gramme that emphasized the need for women to be actively involved in peacebuilding, the LWI helped build stability and peace in Liberia. LWI\u2019s efforts also laid the ground- work for a founding LWI member, Ruth Per- ry, to be elected as Liberia\u2019s head of state. 3 Several common understandings and par- adoxes inform the work of all these groups. The fi rst understanding is the necessity of involving as many ordinary people as pos- sible in building peace. For peace to be sus- tainable, peace processes and reconstruction must be owned by the communities involved. Women\u2019s engagement in such peace process- es are especially critical. Women\u2019s political marginalisation paradoxically often provides them with a wider space for peacebuilding. Their motivation in becoming involved in peacebuilding often stems from, or is per- ceived as, the desire or need to provide for their family, especially children. This con- cern for their family gives many women the permission to enter formerly forbidden male political territory. Because of their previous marginalised position, women may be per- ceived as outside the infl uence of a confl ict\u2019s major stakeholders. This means that wom- en\u2019s peacemaking initiatives may be trusted more by a community than those of peace- makers coming from the political elite. Angela E. V. King, Special Advisor on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women to the United Nations, pointed out some of these perceptions in analysing the role of women in the United Nations Observer Mis- sion in South Africa (UNOMSA), which she served as Chief of Mission. While she writes of foreign women in the role of observers, C ROSSING THE LINES Shelley Anderson founded the Women Peacemakers Program (WPP) in 1997 and is currently a WPP Programme Offi cer.

Anderson is an experienced non- violence trainer and has conducted trainings in gender and peacebuilding throughout the world.

Some practical examples of how the WPP works are given below. The Sudanese Women\u2019s Voice for Peace \u2018Peace comes from talking to your ene- mies\u2019, says Teody Lotto of the NGO Sudanese Women\u2019s Voice for Peace. 5 The SWVP is a good example of the role community-based to their kitchens and more traditional gen- der roles. In what ways are community-based wom- en\u2019s peace groups promoting dialogue and rebuilding societies destroyed by armed con- fl ict? To answer this question we will fi rst look at the work of the International Fel- lowship of Reconciliation (IFOR) Women\u2019s Peacemakers Program (WPP). Empowering women peacemakers The WPP began in 1997, though its roots go back much further. The WPP\u2019s operating assumptions include the belief that without peace, development is impossible and that without women, neither peace nor devel- opment can take place. Other assumptions include the belief that peacebuilding, espe- cially in a post-confl ict situation, is a long term process, and that the principal actors in such reconstruction should be the affected communities themselves. The WPP\u2019s main goal is to support and strengthen women\u2019s peacemaking initiatives and capacities. The WPP does this in four ways: 1. By helping women\u2019s groups to organise training in active nonviolence and confl ict resolution (as has been with tribal wom- en in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, along women inside a particular community may also be perceived in the same way. \u2018The pres- ence of women seems to be a potent ingredi- ent in fostering and maintaining confi dence and trust among the local population\u2019, she writes. \u2018In performing their tasks with their male colleagues, women were perceived to be more compassionate, less threatening or insistent on status, less willing to opt for force or confrontation over conciliation, even it is said less egocentric, more willing to listen and learn \u2014 though not always \u2014 and to contribute to an environment of sta- bility that fostered the peace process\u2019. 4 Confl ict can thus lead to social transfor- mation. In some post-confl ict situations, such as in Cambodia and Rwanda, male death rates during the armed violence means that the surviving population may be 60 to 70 per cent female. Reconstruction in such societies often demands that women take on new roles. Whether women keep this new ground and/or use it to promote improve- ments in women\u2019s status after the crisis that has made such an opening possible is over, is an unanswered question. In Western his- tory, during the Second World War, women in the UK, Canada and the US were mobi- lised in unprecedented numbers to work in jobs and decision-making functions former- ly restricted to men.

Other international peace organisations are also cooperating with the SWVP. In 1997, Pax Christi started a pilot trauma counsel- ling project in Nairobi, for Sudanese refugee women, and inside Sudan, in Mapel. \u2018In this project we help women to feel free to tell of their suffering\u2019, says Lotto. \u2018We ask women not to hold bitterness in their hearts, but to go to trained women to be healed of trauma and aggression. You cannot amend the past but you can correct the future'. Work in the former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus Women's groups, like the Women in Black in Belgrade and the Anti-War Coalition in Zagreb, were among the fi rst to publicly op- pose nationalist and ethnic violence when war fi rst broke out in former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. IFOR supported these groups in practical ways, by distributing their statements and manifestos; publicising their work with dissidents, military desert- ers, conscientious objectors and refugees; helping to relay messages between the two groups when telephone and fax communi- cation between Belgrade and Zagreb were cut; providing safe spaces where Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian activists could meet; and eventually helping these and other anti- war groups to secure computer equipment and in getting online. ing.

The Sudanese confl ict has provided some women an opportunity to explore public space and power negotiations with men in a way that peace-time society did not. This opening up of possibilities for positive social transformation during a period of confl ict resolution is not unique. The Wajir Peace and Development Committee, a community- based group in north-eastern Kenya com- posed primarily of women, is also creating a public political role and voice for women. The women\u2019s on going work to prevent vio- lence between different clans has mobilised both youth, a group not normally listened to, and the traditional decision-makers, older men, to work together to create peace and stability. \u2018When one elder asked me how I, a woman, dared to speak in public', says one Committee activist, \u2018I asked him, \u201cIf your house was on fi re would you wait to put it out until a neighbour came?\u201d My house is on fi re and I must put it out\u2019. The WPP also helped the SWVP make crit- ical international links during its formation in order to secure non-violence training, of- fi ce support and funding. SWVP members were invited by IFOR to international gath- erings, such as the 1994 \u2018Women, Religion and Peace\u2019 seminar in Sweden; the 1995 UN women can play in the peaceful resolution of armed confl icts. It is also exemplifi es the role dialogue on all levels \u2014 between com- munities in violent confl ict, between differ- ent factions inside particular communities, and between confl ictants and the interna- tional community plays in nonviolent con- fl ict resolution. Lotto\u2019s attitude refl ects SWVP\u2019s approach to its work in transforming Sudanese soci- ety through peacebuilding and human rights advocacy. Such an attitude is a key element towards a dialogue that makes for reconcili- ation. \u2018I am not interested in revenge. Will revenge bring back my loved ones? No!\u2019 she states. SWVP teaches confl ict resolu- tion skills to villagers. \u2018We have trained 66 women trainers so far\u2019, Lotto says. \u2018When we come to an area we ask the women to select the women with infl uence in the village. These leaders are trained in non-violence and reconciliation, so they can train oth- ers. We teach women to promote traditional peacemaking, to bring different villages to forgive one another\u2019. Village women have been empowered to begin a dialogue with guerrilla leaders. \u2018Sometimes the women come together to talk to rebels who have been raping, loot- ing and burning houses. When the wom- en oppose this, they have made some rebel leaders change. The leaders see how some soldiers took advantage to loot, pretend- ing that they are under orders.

This is explained in the introduction to Re- storing The Culture of Peace in the Cauca- sus: A Human Solidarity Document. 7 This 86-page book records the testimonies of some 60 women and men during the con- fl icts in Georgia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The testimonies were collected by the NGO Assist Yourself, an organisation of mostly women internally displaced people from Abkhazia, 8 explicitly because \u2018there exists a risk that it [the sto- ries] might disappear some time, and infor- mation of a different, negative kind, used by the destructive forces, would promote further separation and distrust\u2019. During the WPP European consultation, Gulnara Shaninian of Armenia emphasized the importance of such attempts. \u2018My gener- ation had personal relationships with Azeris, lived side by side as neighbours, had friend- ships. This generation only knows enemy images and war. This will make it harder to build peace for the future\u2019. 9 IFOR members remain committed to work- ing with community groups throughout the Balkans. The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) in the United States helped several hundred young Bosnians continue their sec- ondary school and university education in whether Serbian, Albanian, Slav or Roma, saved the lives of members from the \u2018other' community. \u2018In working on peacebuilding there are several important points that we need to bear in mind. First and foremost, peace (and confl ict) is based on the relation- ship. Therefore, building peace needs to be focused on the relationship\u2019, writes BPT vol- unteer Erik Torch, 6 \u2018[there is] overwhelming pressure within Albanian society to portray all Serbs and Slavs and Roma as inherently evil [...] how does one begin to deconstruct such attitudes in others? It requires a rela- tionship that is strong enough to challenge such attitudes\u2019. Similar challenges to enemy images have been undertaken by other community-based peace groups. The IDP Women\u2019s Association of Georgia specifi cally focuses on children and youth in this regard, bringing togeth- er Georgian, Abkhazian and Ossetian chil- dren in peace camps where they will have a chance to build personal relationships with their enemy counterparts and learn peace- building skills. The IDP Women\u2019s Association has also been involved in documenting sto- ries where people from one community saved individuals from the opposite side. \u2018Ethnically induced armed confrontation had one more side: a humane one. The facts are [...] people, at the risk of their own lives, IFOR was also a founding member of the Balkan Peace Team (BPT, a cooperative project by some 11 peace NGOs, including War Resisters International and Peace Bri- gades International). BPT has been sending trained volunteers to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo/a and Serbia since 1994, to support local civil society groups and to assist with dialogue and community con- fl ict resolution projects. One example of how BPT works occurred in 1998, when students in southern Serbia wanted to do something about the growing tensions in Kosovo/a. The students approached BPT to help make con- nections with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo/a. BPT organised a prejudice reduction work- shop for the Serbian students, then accom- panied the students on a visit to an Alba- nian youth group inside Kosovo/a. The Serb students attended a nonviolent march in Kosovo/a as observers. They were able to re- port back to their community on the Serbian police\u2019s aggression against the marchers. After the 1999 NATO bombing campaign the BPT offi ce in Belgrade was shut down. The BPT in Pristina continues to assist lo- cal groups in working for a multi-ethnic Kosovo/a.

        "[ 81 ] The functions women have in recon- ciliation processes are complex, refl ecting the multiple roles women have in society. Like women's lives, such functions must be viewed holistically. Women are peace educators inside the family, in schools, in women's and mixed organisations and else- where. Their networks and knowledge of lo- cal affairs make them effective early warn- ing monitors, alert for rumours, increasing tensions, a sudden infl ux of weapons and others sign of potential confl ict. Their some- times extensive kinship links, social expec- tations and training can make women highly effective mediators. Their status as outsid- ers, the perception that they are not primary stakeholders in confl ict, also reveal a role as negotiators and originators of new ap- proaches to peace. The challenge for people interested in rec- onciliation is to explore this complexity and to develop an integrated gender approach. Such an approach would investigate both the ways in which women contribute to and oppose armed confl ict. Most of all such an approach needs to discover concrete ways to support community-based women\u2019s work for peace. suda packed up meat and sent it home with them to their parents.

This fact is being recog- nised more and more by confl ict resolu- tion specialists, government offi cials and development agencies. Despite this growing awareness, women\u2019s peacemaking initiatives remain under-resourced. There is a danger that women\u2019s work for reconciliation and reconstruction can be seen as a \u2018natural' extension of women's role in society. This means that such work goes unrecognised and inadequately resourced. It is stripped of its political meaning and rendered, like much of women's work, invisible. Women remain marginalised, their problems ignored, their experiences unanalysed, and their skills underutilised.

So, sometimes I steal them and use them to build kiosks for the children. In 14 years, we have progressed a lot at Maison Shalom. When we began, we only had computer boxes to use as cradles for babies. We had love though and I think that shows that love is inventive! At the time, we saw all the buildings and seminars that were being funded. Crumbs were all we got! We are tired of getting crumbs; we are all brothers and sisters in this world. What does Maison Shalom represent and how does it make a difference? Maison Shalom is more than a project; it is a message. It is a message of peace ad- dressed to everyone, not just policy-makers. We believe in living in dignity and in refus- ing hate and fratricide, despite the atroci- ties that surrounded us. It is about being able to go to school, to receive health care and to say that we live in a country free from war. We wel- come children from Congo and Rwanda. We also welcome child soldiers and teach them a trade so they can have a fresh start in a new job. We give work to people in our care. Our initiatives have included everything from hairdressers to cinemas. I have seen orphaned children grow up and work to and others back in Burundi. I know I am their voice and I have the chance to speak from the heart to people who can make a difference. My hope is that this voice is heard. For me, just to be invited to this conference shows that decision-makers are thinking about people in my country. At the table of big players, it is important that a place is also kept for others. What are the diffi culties you face when dealing with governments and decision makers? Our work is complex. All the big organi- sations, for example at governmental level, have bureaucratic systems that can be very time-consuming to deal with. We work in the fi eld and often need to react as a mat- ter of urgency. We see the poverty at fi rst hand and we know that two days waiting for a decision can make the difference be- tween life and death. We call on the people in power to make the processes less bureaucratic. Our gov- ernment tends to need endless documents and long reports to be able to see what we want to achieve. Our focus is on the result. I don\u2019t mean to criticise the work the gov- ernment does. I am part of the same nation after all. We just need a better synergy. I call on them to trust us more, to give us the means to make our plans possible. They will be happy to see what we can do! Organisations always want to have big You are in Brussels to speak at an EU crisis management conference. Is it some- times diffi cult to get your message across to decision-makers who might not have the same life experiences as you? When I speak at a conference, I speak from the heart. I do not just give a speech. Speaking about your human calling is eas- ier because you do not need to convince people. I taught for a long time so I know how diffi cult it is to try and \u201cteach a les- son\u201d to people. It is easier for me just to speak about what happened in my life and about the dreams I have for the future. I talk about living among a people who experienced a 10-year civil war that oth- ers did not even talk. People are aware of Rwanda but they do not talk about neigh- bouring Burundi, which suffered 10 years of atrocities. We sometimes felt aban- doned but I have always said to people that I would like to bring some light into this darkness. I communicate in the same way with everyone, whether it\u2019s a homeless person in a train station or a prince in a palace. I know that everyone is created in God\u2019s image. Even if I sometimes come across arrogant people who do not want to listen, I do not fi nd it diffi cult to meet politicians or decision-makers.

        "[ 84 ] we could help each other a lot more than we do now! What role can expatriate Burundians play? There are Burundians who qualifi ed as doctors back home but retrained as nurses abroad to earn more money and be accept- ed there. Some highly qualifi ed people are even delivering newspapers for a living. I call on them to come back! We have empty universities and hospitals at home. Many have returned to Burundi but I do recognise that it is diffi cult. The govern- ment must give our intellectuals and quali- fi ed nationals the salary and dignity they deserve. If a university professor earns only \u20ac 80 a month in Burundi, it is understand- able that people do not return. Personally, though, I think it is better to fi ght for your rights in your own country and maintain your identity. What does it mean to be rich anyway? It isn\u2019t about money. People in material pov- erty can still have a strong identity and fi ght together for their civil rights. In Af- rica, we have a debt to our families who paid for our school studies when we were children. We shouldn\u2019t be cowards or forget where we came from. You have a very positive message. What hopes do you have that others will be able to move on from the past? I believe in the triumph of humanity and in extending the hand of friendship. I will not be discouraged by fatalistic speeches or Hutu or Tutsi. I hear about the number of suicides in Europe and it makes me think about opening a Maison Shalom there too! Trust us. I think Africans can show how to fi ght problems without becoming disheart- ened. We could have a real partnership. The world is constantly changing. Not so long ago Europeans were migrating to America because they were in a bad eco- nomic situation. Tomorrow Africa could wake up and make use of the richness it possesses in natural resources. Maybe one day we will be helping Europe and the rest of the world! Our capacity to help is perhaps limit- ed because many people have little con- sciousness of the world beyond their bor- ders. Events that may grab their attention at fi rst are often soon forgotten. That is human psychology, but fortu- nately, there are also people in the world who do not forget. There are always proph- ets among us who awake others. When the customs offi cers ask me what I\u2019m going to do in a country, I say I\u2019m here to see my brothers and sisters! There are so many barriers, real and psychological. In times of war, people suspect you are an asylum seeker. The world is afraid of poor people but it should see sharing as a richness. There is no worse enemy to man than fear. It can even drive us to kill each other. Maybe I am utopian to wish there were no barriers but imagine a world without passports. Life would be much easier and earn their livelihood. Among the children who have been in my charge, one went on to become the governor of a province, an- other to work for UNICEF. It shows there is hope. We continue our work. Our latest project is to build a hospital. Of course, there are highs and lows. It is fortunate that we all have crises from time to time, because they confront us with reality and remind us of our limits. There will always be despair but we should put the emphasis on what we can do. One child saved is humanity saved. Your work is also spreading outside your country\u2019s borders? I feel I am a citizen of the world. I am attached to my country but I know I have a wider role to play too. We have recent- ly sent people to help in the Democratic Republic of Congo. If we have to go to Iraq, we\u2019ll go there too because we are all part of the same human family. People talk about Africa in terms of stereotypes and caricatures. They paint a dark picture: the AIDS situation in many countries, the genocide in Rwanda, and the terrible misery in Darfur. All that is true and real. I don\u2019t say we should close our eyes. But what people often overlook is our joie de vivre . Africa can wake up and sur- prise people! We have a lot of young people and there is real hope for the future.

Would it help your country to have more women in positions of power? Fortunately, Africa has always had many mothers. A woman gives life. All human beings were once physically connected to their mothers. It is a fabulous thing but life is not possible without the contribution of a man. What I mean to say is that we need both men and women to play a role. I don\u2019t want to shock anyone but I al- ready see women everywhere in power: even the mother or wife of the president for example. We are pillars of this world and I do not feel that I have been denied any- thing because I am a woman. I have always demanded that my rights be respected. Today I am a woman, a mother to 10,000 children and doors open everywhere be- cause I opened my heart. It is for no reason more extraordinary than that. There is a lot more I want to do but I have limits of health and character. I am not a saint! But I fi nd life beautiful. I want to stop people and tell them that. We should not wait for paradise in the afterlife. It is already here in our hearts! by bitter, desperate people. My duty is not to change the face of Burundi. I must not take myself too seriously or put the whole of Burundi on my shoulders. I believe that every situation has a so- lution. I was tied up when I witnessed the murder of 72 people but I was able to do something afterwards. I took care of their children. Every one of those children has been successful at school and some already have gone to university or got married. For those people killed on that day, they saw in my eyes that I supported them and this gave some small sliver of light and hope. So, I was not powerless. Love is inventive. I continue to look after young people and hope there will be a new generation who will understand and carry on this message on. We need to approach those who are dis- couraged or vengeful and make them un- derstand that hate kills. I will not fall into either fatalism or utopianism. I am realistic. I am a hands-on person! The message to the children is to stand upright, to maintain their dignity, and above all not to be disheartened by statis- tics from the World Bank or the IMF that rank Burundi as last in the world.

How does this differ from what you were doing before? Before it was more a reactive instrument, mainly trying to disburse funds quickly in response to a singular event. Now, the ac- tions under the Stability Instrument are em- bedded in a broader response capacity of the European Union. As mentioned earlier, we now have more triggers for the Stabil- ity Instrument. Another major difference is that in the past we could only deploy for a maximum of six months, so it was really a short-term, immediate reaction. Now it is 18 months, so we can establish a close link be- tween short-term emergency assistance and long-term development aid. What spurred this change in strategy? There was strong pressure from the Eu- ropean side \u2014 both civil society and gov- ernments \u2014 but also from our international partners, to do more, to be more present and to have more funds available for immedi- ate crisis response. We not only want to do more, we want to do it better. Our new ap- million a year by 2013. So, combined with the budget for Member State operations un- der the CFSP we will have a budget of about \u20ac 800 million by the year 2013 for the EU to respond to crisis situations, this in addition to the yearly \u20ac 7- 8 billion for other exter- nal actions, such as humanitarian assistance, development co-operation and pre- accession. Now, how are we going to use this extra money? Well, the fi rst trigger for using the Stability Instrument is the opportunity of responding to an immediate crisis situation or trying to prevent a confl ict from getting worse or breaking out. The second possibil- ity is helping the international community to make use of a window of opportunity in a frozen confl ict: for example, if there is a breakthrough in the Arab \u2014 Israeli peace talks the parties may ask the international community to underpin that agreement with specifi c actions. The third trigger is if the EU decides to deploy a police or military opera- tion; there is often an opportunity for close co-operation. We are doing this in Chad, where the European military protects the ci- vilian UN police mission, and the European Commission in turn funds the international component of that UN police operation. The fourth trigger is the need for help to recre- ate an environment conducive to long-term The Instrument for Stability 1 dramatically increases the funds available to the Europe- an Commission for confl ict prevention and crisis management. What are you going to do with these funds and how will it change the way you work? The European Union is facing a number of challenges, such as dealing with crises and confl icts, addressing the disparity of wealth around the world \u2014 which in itself can be a root cause of confl icts \u2014 and managing natural resources in ways that do not lead to further confl icts. The European public expects us to respond to these challenges and the international community expects us to share the burden of international cri- sis management. That\u2019s where we come in. The EU has a number of crisis response tools \u2014 humani- tarian assistance, civil protection \u2014 provid- ing assistance to countries hit by disasters and the military and police missions that are operated by Member States under the head- ing of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The tool we are dealing with here is the Instrument for Stability (IfS), which replaces the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM).

With all these different bodies, both in and out of house, working to alleviate crisis situations and humanitarian disasters, isn\u2019t there a risk of duplication and overlap? It works, but improvement is always pos- sible. Michel Barnier drew up a report last year where he suggested there should be only one offi ce dealing with humanitarian crises. At the moment you have ECHO (the European Commission Humanitarian Of- fi ce) and the Commission civil protection offi ce. He suggests replacing both with a one-stop shop. Is the EU in a position to talk about con- fl ict prevention, given its record in the Bal- kans, Rwanda and Darfur? The EU is undertaking a vast range of ac- tivities in the fi eld of confl ict prevention. Assisting others in their efforts to carry out political and economic reforms, working with them on governance issues, human rights and democratisation, including elec- tion observation, but also on security sector reform and the rule of law have been im- portant contributions to confl ict prevention for many years. ESDP is a relatively new addition to the EU's foreign policy tools and the EU hasn't shied away from using There is so much knowledge and expertise out there among NGOs, Member States and think-tanks that it would be unwise not to tap into those resources. It doesn\u2019t have to be a very complicated procedure \u2014 you call up those of your partners who have knowledge and expertise on the given issue, organise a brainstorming and draw on the valuable information these organisations have from working in the fi eld. Is there a specifi cally European approach to confl ict prevention and crisis manage- ment, and what is the European value-add- ed in dealing with these issues? Why the European Union? Because it is regarded as a civilian power. That is an as- set that makes it easier for the EU to en- gage with others because we are not seen as a body that wants to impose anything or that has a hidden agenda. Why the EU institutions? Because we work closely with all Member States have their politi- cal weight behind us which guarantees a greater impact. In terms of a European approach to these issues, we know what the link is between security and development; they are two sides of the same coin and you can\u2019t have one without the other. People recognise we have a very strong developmental approach that can also have an impact on security. Others may have a different approach, plac- ing security at the top of their agenda and proach is more coherent, by way of better co-ordination with our European and in- ternational partners \u2014 but also by ensuring that the different stages and phases of an intervention are well interlinked. How do you cooperate with other international actors and how does the EU\u2019s approach to crisis prevention and management differ from them? One thing is very clear \u2014 a single country, or the EU, cannot handle an international crisis on its own. You have to have a global approach and work very early in the crisis with international partners. Of course every- one follows their own strategies and applies their own rules and procedures but we have to make sure we coordinate very closely with each other. In fact, one of the features of the Stability Instrument is that we are im- plementing our programmes and projects with the help of others. In November 2007 we launched the idea of setting up a Peace- building Partnership through which we es- tablish partnerships with the best-qualifi ed organisations, agencies and think-tanks to work on crisis situations. Isn\u2019t there are a risk that by involving so many partners your response will be slowed down? I\u2019m quite confi dent it won\u2019t slow it down and will, on the contrary, give us access to the best-qualifi ed partners to work with. ",

Is this a job that keeps you awake at night, worrying when the next disaster will strike? In the business of crisis response the stress level is pretty high, but when you see you can have positive results, when you know you have the tools and the support you need, you don\u2019t think \u201cwhat will I do to- morrow if there\u2019s an earthquake?\u201d It\u2019s more like \u201chow can we do the job quickly and in close coordination with others?\u201d The prob- lem with crises and disasters is you can\u2019t foresee them, you can\u2019t programme your response in advance; so you have to take them as they come, but better make sure you are prepared. Europeans make 180 million trips outside the EU each year and when you have a ca- tastrophe like the 2004 tsunami, when you saw all these European citizens stranded in south-east Asia, you see a need for the EU to react faster, quicker and better. Can you point to any outright successes the EU has had in the fi eld, where you are person- ally proud of its response and follow-up? Aceh in Indonesia is a good example of the European Union using the instruments it has in the right way. There, the European Commission supported the former Finnish President Martti Ahtissari in his efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. When that was signed, the EU Member States set up a mis- sion to monitor the implementation of that agreement. Now the mission has come to an end but the European Commission is there to assist with the longer-term development of it \u2014 some 17 or 18 times in fact, both mili- tary and civilian operations. There is obviously an intrinsic, moral need to intervene in crisis situations, but are there any knock-on benefi ts for the EU in acting fast in terms of its image or standing? A long-standing complaint of the Euro- pean Union has been that it is a payer, but not a player. With these new instruments this is changing. The EU is becoming more and more involved in international affairs and not only as a donor. But visibility is still a problem and more needs to be done in this area. We need to explain why we are doing all this. First, I think it is because European public expects the EU to do more to make the world a little bit safer. But also when you improve your crisis response ca- pability you also help European citizens who are stranded abroad in a confl ict situation. ",

Early warning is defi ned as the communi- cation of information on a crisis area, anal- ysis of that information and the develop- ment of a potential, timely, strategic response options to the crisis. 1 Early warning differs from intelligence systems in that early warn- ing is not concerned with a direct threat to the gatherer or analyser of the information, or those contemplating a response. Early warning is concerned with the prevention, mitigation or management of violent con- fl icts. There is an intrinsic link between the collection and analysis of information and the intended response. In fact, the design and management of early warning systems should be intimately connected with the task of determining responses to warning. The following factors, by and large, can affl ict the analysis of information (like early warning signals): incredulity, mind-blind- ness and shadow and noise 2 . \u2018Shadows' are referred to as external blinkers. This occurs increased risk of confl ict \u2014 but not of early warning itself. In recent years the problem of obtaining early warning has received a great deal of attention not only within the United Na- tions, the European Union and governments, but also from NGOs and research special- ists. However, the more diffi cult problem of marshalling timely, effective response to warning has received much less systematic attention. A major problem is one of politi- cal will. Early warning rarely leads to effec- tive and timely response. One of the reasons for this is that early warning is largely a technical exercise, while early response is a political exercise. There needs to be political will to intervene, but all too often the will is just not there. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the potentials of building a strategic part- nership between the EU and civil society organisations. In this partnership, civil so- ciety organisations would play a signifi cant role in providing early warning and the EU would play a role in designing a genuine early response. The argumentation is built on the strengths of civil society organisation Introduction What we have seen now in Darfur since early 2003 is slow-motion ethnic cleansing taking place before the world\u2019s eyes. More than 200,000 have died in the confl ict, most from confl ict-related disease and malnutri- tion. What makes this all the more tragic is that policy-makers and leaders around the world knew exactly what was happening there. They cannot plead ignorance. There has been no lack of warning about what is going on as it unfolded. Thanks to the work of Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch, the UN\u2019s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Juan Mendez, and many others, these atrocities were well documented. Yet despite all the evidence, the international community has utterly failed in its respon- sibility to protect the people of Darfur. Darfur is only one of the many examples where early warning failed to result in ad- equate confl ict prevention early respons- es. Why is it so hard to intervene to pre- vent confl icts? There is no shortage of early warning for those who want to be informed. There is perhaps a shortage of early warning systems \u2014 systems that rigorously and sys- tematically track indicators that correlate to A STRATEGIC \u2018P EACEBUILDING P ARTNERSHIP \u2019\u2014 FROM EARLY WARNING BY CIVIL SOCIETY TO EARLY RESPONSE BY THE E UROPEAN U NION Jos De la Haye, PhD is currently Confl ict Adviser for Pax Christi International.

Additionally, among the seven key functions, \u2018monitoring and early warn- ing\u2019 are the two functions assigned to civil society organisations active in peacebuilding work 5 (compare below). Strengths of civil society on early warning The civil society arena is populated by an array of diverse actors, including formal and informal associations, organisations and movements. 6 Civil society organisations are a \u2018wide array of non-governmental and not- for-profi t organisations that have a presence in public life, expressing the interests and values of their members or others, based on ethical, cultural, political, scientifi c, religious or philanthropic considerations\u2019. As such it depicts a broad range of organisations, such as community groups, women\u2019s association, labour unions, indigenous groups, youth groups, charitable organisations, founda- tions, faith-based organisations, independent media, professional associations, think tanks, independent educational organisations and social movements. The strength of civil society organisa- tions (CSOs), compared with governmental organisations, is that they are well embed- ded into society, and therefore an important Triangulation of data gathering is a meth- od often applied in evaluations organised in areas affected by violent confl ict. Triangu- lation involves comparing and contrasting information received from one source to similar information received from anoth- er, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the intervention and the confl ict dynam- ics. 4 Therefore, the information gathered and analysed by representatives of civil society should be considered as one of the several sources of information gathering and analy- sis. Additionally, there is the problem of the levels, internal and international, on which peacebuilding efforts are undertaken. There- fore characteristics of an ideal early warn- ing system are: (cid:129) have some local researchers in the fi eld, and (cid:129) organise backstopping of the local re- searchers with, for example, a network of experts (e.g. from academia and electroni- cally linked to participate in the provision of information and analyses). In sum, this is information that is to be found within civil society itself. In fact, it has been widely acknowledged that civil society organisations are well placed to gather information on the politi- when previous experiences that haunt de- cision-makers distort their perceptions and constrain their willingness to act. One such blinker is the shadow of hope. In the pur- suit of the peace agreement, the hope in- vested in its effectiveness and the eager- ness to see it implemented might dominate the attention to the detriment of any pitfalls (e.g. security risks). Another blinker is \u2018the shadow of despair\u2019: the tendency to read the present through trauma of the past. \u2018Noise\u2019 is a standard element often used to explain intelligence failures. In a context crowded with actual crises, it is particularly diffi cult to get busy decision-makers to shift their at- tention onto a potential crisis. Analysts involved in early warning per- ceive confl ict dynamics from a wide time perspective: forward and backward. Atten- tion has also to be paid to deeper layers of confl ict. When considering the underlying layer of motives, apprehensions and often ideology, we enter the realm of chaotic emo- tional unreason. War engenders a mental environment of desperation in which fear, resentment, jealousy and rage predominate. Consequently, confl ict analysis requires not only attention to the hardware of confl ict (the political\u2014diplomatic, military, legal, eco- nomic and ecological), but also to the softer and less visible layers of the deep confl ict. 3 3 Luc Reychler, \u2018Field diplomacy initiatives in Cameroon and Burundi\u2019.

        "[ 123 ] (cid:129) avoiding too much contact with any one group. Examples of civil society-based early warning Today there are a number of civil society- based early warning models. Here we will describe only a few of them. For instance, the FAST Early Warning mechanism from Swisspeace, enhances political decision- makers' ability to identify critical develop- ments in order to formulate coherent po- litical strategies to either prevent or limit violent confl ict, or recognise chances for peacebuilding. The International Crisis Group (or \u2018Crisis Group\u2019) produces qualitative early warning. The task of their analysts is to fi nd out what is happening and why. They identify the underlying political, social and economic factors creating the conditions for confl ict as well as the more immediate causes of ten- sion. The purpose of the ICG\u2019s reports is to warn, as early and effectively as possible, those who are able to infl uence a situation where the risk of new or renewed confl ict has reached a dangerous threshold. Crisis Group\u2019s particular value-added in this re- spect is that all their reporting and analy- sis is fi eld-based. They are steeped in local language and culture, engaged in endless interaction with locals and internationals on the scene, and operating from 14 regional On the other hand, one has to acknowl- edge the risk for potentially biased and dis- torted fi ndings, which could arise from par- ticipatory evaluation methodologies \u2014 when local people are, themselves, involved in a confl ict. However, guidelines do exist on how to gather information with caution. First, every source must be evaluated for accuracy, bias and judgement, and not au- tomatically dismissed or accepted. Even a biased source may have important infor- mation, and a trusted source may provide a mistaken analysis. Second, the monitors must avoid appearing to be too inquisitive, which could give rise to accusations of spy- ing. Third, where necessary, care must be taken with confi dentiality and protection of sources. In addition, one can minimise the risk of perceived and real bias by: (cid:129) being geographically accessible to all key groups; (cid:129) taking care that its methodologies and language skills do not implicitly favour or give greater access to one group over another; (cid:129) ensuring balance in any aspects of mission staffi ng that might project a signal of bias externally; (cid:129) protecting independence from the political agendas of the sponsoring states; (cid:129) sustaining transparent and respectful rela- tionships with different sectors of society; and, source of information. Foster and Mattner 7 identify seven peacebuilding roles of civil society: protection, monitoring and early warning; advocacy; socialisation; social co- hesion; intermediation and facilitation; and service protection. What is relevant here is the acknowledgement of civil society to be well placed to set up early warning mecha- nisms. People based in a society and those specialising in the country/region are best placed to identify the reasons for a confl ict, the motivations of those who are driving it, and to suggest specifi c actions that can be taken to shift its dynamics in a more peace- ful direction. 8 Considering the kind of information that is required for early warning purposes and the strength of civil society organisations in gathering and monitoring of information (compare above) it is rather obvious that pol- icy-makers should make more use of know- how from within civil society during peace and confl ict impact assessment missions. Involving local actors in the early warning systems is a way of ensuring that the analy- sis of the confl ict, and therefore the analysis of the effectiveness of a confl ict prevention policy and peacebuilding activity, is embed- ded to the realities in the fi eld. 9 By making intelligent use of local intelligence the early warning system could also serve as a fi rst explorative ground for policy-outcome map- ping and/or impact assessment purposes. 7 Fostner and Mattner, op. cit.: 4. 8 Catherine Barnes.

CEWARN recognises, however, that there were gaps in its early years of operation- alisation including the lack of an effective response component for the mechanism and the need to expand its information base and areas of reporting to cover all Member States. The EU and early response How can cooperation between the EU and civil society organisations be deepened? How should the EU and the civil society organisa- tions, both European organisations and their local partners, act in the most proper man- ner to enable comprehensive and coherent peacebuilding activities? The real challenge is to tie early warning to effective early action. By \u2018early action' it is meant early action by governments and international and regional organisations. NGOs have the luxury, and the frustration, of being able to warn, but not being able to respond. Governments and international or- ganisations are understandably wary about acting on the warnings of NGOs alone, or sively on pastoralist confl icts \u2014 of both inter- communal and cross-border nature \u2014 before expanding to other types of confl icts in due course. Since its establishment, CEWARN, through its network of Field Monitors, Coun- try Coordinators, National Research Institutes and Confl ict Early Warning and Response Units (CEWERUs) at the national level, has been monitoring and reporting on pastoralist confl icts in two pilot areas: the Somali cluster (which incorporates parts of Kenya, Ethio- pia and Somalia) and the Kamaroja cluster (which incorporates parts of Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda). In this regard, CEWARN has played an important role in bringing to light the severity of previously unmonitored death and destruction relating to pastoralist confl icts. From 2003 to 2006, CEWARN re- corded almost 2,200 confl ict-related deaths and the loss of around 138,000 livestock in more than 1,500 incidents in these pilot ar- eas. CEWARN has recorded marked success in fulfi lling its mandate: \u2018to receive and share information concerning potentially violent confl icts as well as their outbreak and esca- lation in the IGAD region, undertake analy- sis of the information and formulate options for early response\u2019. Its achievements so far include: (cid:129) CEWARN has established itself as a sub-re- gional mechanism with the most developed data-based regional early warning system in Africa; (cid:129) it has developed an effective, state- of-the-art field monitoring and data analysis tool; or local fi eld offi ces in as many different countries, and with a fi eld presence in an- other 50 locations. Another successful example of civil soci- ety-based early warning mechanism is the West Africa Early Warning and Early Re- sponse Network (WARN). This is an integral part of the West Africa Preventive Peace- building Programme of the West Africa Net- work for Peacebuilding (WANEP). Through its WARN Programme, WANEP is setting the stage for a civil society-based early warning and response network in Africa with em- phasis on human security. WARN covers the entire Economic Community of West Afri- can States (ECOWAS) sub-region, including Cameroon and Chad. Their focus was initial- ly the Mano River Basin countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. It has since expanded to cover the entire West Africa sub-region. Another civil society-based example is the Confl ict Early Warning and Response Mecha- nism (CEWARN), which is operational in the Horn of Africa. Its vision is embodied in the tagline, \u2018Stakeholders empowered to prevent violent confl icts!\u2019 Accordingly, its mission is to establish itself as an effective and sustain- able sub-regional mechanism that undertakes confl ict early warning and early response, and fosters cooperation among relevant stakeholders in order to respond to potential and actual violent confl icts in the region in a timely manner. CEWARN has adopted an in- cremental approach initially focusing exclu- ",

In fact, there are two key elements in the IfS: (cid:129) fi rst, crisis response and preparedness that allows timely response to political crisis or natural disaster; (cid:129) second, long-term, transregional threats to stability (e.g. on non-proliferation, organ- ised crime, protection of critical infrastruc- ture and major public health threats). Under the new Stability Instrument crisis response measures include, fi rst, confl ict prevention and peacebuilding, which is un- derstood as pre-empting violent confl ict; supporting peacebuilding and diplomatic in- itiatives for political stabilisation; providing incentives to the parties; fostering stability during political transition; and safeguarding human rights and democratic processes. Sec- ond, addressing the direct consequences of violent confl ict, like de-mining/unexploded ordnance; reconstruction of homes and pub- lic buildings; demobilisation and reintegra- tion of combatants; and decommissioning of small arms/light weapons. Third, promot- ing stabilisation through good governance (elections and constitutional processes, lo- cal government, security sector reform and civil society development). Fourth, ensur- ing basic development needs are addressed from the outset (getting public administra- tion working, getting a national budget in place, getting children back to school, re- opening health and local public services and generating employment). 10 the EU Action Plan for Civilian Aspects of ESDP (2004) welcomes a regular exchange of views with civil society organisations re- garding the general orientation of EU civil- ian crisis management and states that civil society experience and early warning capac- ity are valued by the EU. The recognition that greater efforts need to be undertaken to address how civil society experience and knowledge can be better drawn upon led the Finnish Presidency to launch the project Role of Civil Society in Crisis Management (or RoCS I) in 2006. The new Instrument for Stability (IfS), which was created as part of the reform of Community external fi nancing instruments in 2006 (compare Rapid Reaction Mecha- nism), provides additional means for devel- oping new mechanisms for increased co- herence and for cooperation with relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental actors. It provides the European Union with a new strategic tool to ensure an effective, rapid and fl exible response to political crises as well as to strengthen the capacity of civil society organisations over the longer term. The Stability Instrument takes a broadly based approach, founded on development policy principles. Aid under the Stability Instrument must be: a) coherent with EC country priorities set under the long-term instruments, and b) consistent with CFSP objectives. Further- more, should aid under the Stability In- strument be complementary to EC Human- on any source other than their own. For a start, there is never a shortage of warning about pending disaster in a host of places. Sometimes that warning turns out to be in- adequate. And government action is costly, so there needs to be a degree of certainty to generate action. Governments have limited resources and various emergencies compet- ing for attention and funds. Of course in bureaucracies one will often get into more trouble for urging action and being wrong, than for taking no action when action was needed. Too often the incentives are aligned against early action. The EU has formally recognised the impor- tance of organised civil society. By adopt- ing the EU Programme for the Prevention of violent confl icts in Gothenburg in 2001, the European Council recognised the importance of confl ict prevention as a long-term policy commitment and as one of the main objec- tives of EU external relations. Furthermore, the ESDP procedures for coherent, compre- hensive EU crisis management (2003): http://11127/03 register.consilium.europa.eu/ pdf/en/03/st11/st11127en03.pdf provide entry points for consultation with civil society organisations regarding early warning mechanisms, strategic and opera- tional planning, and mission implementa- tion. These procedures explicitly note that modalities for coordination in the fi eld be- tween the EU and local authorities and civ- il society need to be developed. Moreover, ",
        "[ 126 ] Probably the most signifi cant change in the EU policy instruments is the extended timeframe of its programme to respond. The new procedures allow the European Com- mission to design a response for a period of 18 (+6) months, whereas the old system only enable a programme of 6 months. Another new requirement is close political coordi- nation between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. More particularly, it is interesting to note that the European Commission un- dertook to: (cid:129) strengthen policy-making capacity in the area of crisis response and peace- building; (cid:129) establish a \u2018Peacebuilding Partnership\u2019, in- cluding possible \u2018framework partnership\u2019 arrangements with NGOs; (cid:129) establish a logistical capacity to support the deployment of civilian experts, and (cid:129) give specifi c commitments relating to counter-terrorism measures. Conclusion At a conference in Berlin in June 2007 (under the German EU Presidency) it was argued that to promote such a strategic partnership further investment is needed in developing a culture of cooperation based on dialogue and mutual trust between the EU and its civil society partners. For the EU, such effectiveness requires the active solicitation of input from civil society or- ganisations in order to benefi t from their expertise, their understanding of the long- term situations and contexts, and their en- gagement with local civil society. For civil society organisations, such effectiveness re- quires proactive engagement with the EU at Member State and fi eld levels. A framework for engagement and collaboration will make such a partnership more effective. The new Peacebuilding Partnership pro- gramme from the European Commission opens a window of opportunity to devel- op a strategic partnership with civil society organisations. The aim of the Peacebuilding Partnership is to mobilise and consolidate civilian exper- tise on peacebuilding. One of the priorities is to strengthen civil society\u2019s early warn- ing capacity. In fact, civil society coopera- tion with governmental institutions should become part of the EU\u2019s \u2018DNA'. Both the EU and civil society organisations must be prepared to listen to each other, and the EU needs to be willing to provide time, space and resources to civil society organisations to enable them to become respected dialogue partners in mutual cooperation. 10 Information based on a presentation of the IfS given at the Pax Christi International offi ces during a PeaceNet meeting November 2007 by two members of the Crisis Management and Confl ict Prevention Unit.

While the mode of reaction to these demands were not in the original PPEW work programme, they were fully in line with the goals of the early warning plat- form established in 2004 as a recommen- dation of the Second International Confer- ence on Early Warning. The most signifi cant factor was the multi-agency, multi-donor Flash Appeal project proposal that had been quickly produced by PPEW to support tsu- nami early warning systems in the Indian Ocean, and to which donors contributed US $10.5 million. The PPEW developed and coordinated the implementation of the project in cooperation with UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceano- graphic Commission (UNESCO/IOC), which oversees the coordination of the establish- ment of early warning systems for tsunamis and other ocean-related hazards in the In- dian Ocean, North Eastern Atlantic, Mediter- ranean and Caribbean regions. The project was fi nanced with contributions from seven donors, namely the governments of Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway R EPORT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE MULTI - DONOR INITIATIVE \u2018 EVALUATION AND STRENGTHENING OF EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS ' IN COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY THE 26 DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI Stefanie Dannenmann (Germany), PhD joined the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) Platform for the Promotion of Early Warning (PPEW) in Bonn, Germany, in April 2005. Among other duties, Dr Dannenmann supports the ISDR\u2019s system partners in their assistance to Indian Ocean governments to strengthen the regional and national tsunami early warning system. She has worked in the hazards and risk management fi eld for several years. Douglas Pattie (United States), PhD is the coordinator of the Platform for the Promotion of Early Warning (PPEW) at the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) in Bonn, Germany. Dr Pattie\u2019s works on a number of problems confronting methodological and institutional issues surrounding early warning systems; the use of traditional knowledge for disaster reduction, participatory GIS for vulnerability and risk reduction; mapping land-cover dynamics; and community-based fi re management. Prior to joining the UN/ISDR he served as an environmental affairs offi cer with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertifi cation. ",
        "[ 128 ] The project components were identifi ed broadly in two different areas, namely warn- ing system development and preparedness. As a cross-cutting theme, the project pro- moted \u2018people-centred early warning sys- tems\u2019 emphasizing (i) risk knowledge, that is, prior knowledge of the risks faced by com- munities; (ii) monitoring and warning serv- ice; (iii) communications and dissemination of understandable warnings to those at risk; and (iv) response capability and prepared- ness to act by those threatened aspects. The PPEW established a Project Overview Plan 2 and developed a web-accessible project database and information system (TEWIS) 3 . PPEW delivered substantial inputs to and activities. Some project activities were at- tended by all 28 countries, but fi nancial sup- port was provided mainly for the partici- pants from developing countries. At the national level, the project not only benefi ted national governments, but also their disaster management agencies, local authorities, scientifi c and technical insti- tutions, the broadcasting sector as well as other practitioners from the civil society and communities at selective locations. Wider participation was sought for all project ac- tivities, in particular, at the regional, nation- al and local level. Gender-related project ac- tivities were highlighted by such agencies as AIDMI, CRED, UNDP India and UNU-EHS. coordination proved to be effective. Efforts were mainly on (i) establishing the project administration and underpinnings, particu- larly partner work programmes and mem- oranda of understanding; (ii) supporting UNESCO/IOC to develop governance mech- anisms and technical inputs for a regional tsunami warning system; and (iii) providing project coordination and integration. More than half of the funds received have been streamed to other key agencies. Partnerships and coordination have been strengthened across many UN agencies, regional and na- tional organisations, research institutes, and local communities. The project Although the original UN Flash Appeal was confi ned to a sub-set of affected coun- tries, a series of consultation meetings led to a general agreement by implementing agen- cies and donors that all countries affected by the 24 December 2004 tsunami and other countries at risk of tsunamis should be in- volved in this project for the establishment of tsunami early warning system in the In- dian Ocean Region. The project supported all countries that are members of the UNESCO/ IOC 1 in the Indian Ocean region. At the out- set, the number of Indian Ocean member countries was 27. This increased to 28 (see Figure 1) when Djibouti formally joined. However, Djibouti, even as an informal IOC member, had participated in various project Figure 1: Countries supported by the project 1 http://ioc3.unesco.org/indotsunami/interimsystem/focal_points.htm 2 http://www.unisdr.org/ppew/tsunami/pdf/project-overview-plan.pdf 3 http://unisdr.unbonn.org/index.php ",

With the project\u2019s groundwork in place, there had been accelerated emphasis on the role of UN/ISDR secretariat in setting the di- rections and fostering implementation and supporting activities in the region, in par- ticular on the components of integrated risk management, public awareness and educa- tion and community-based approaches to stimulate the development of effective end- to-end multi-hazard warning capacities and wider public engagement. Sustainability of early warning systems The Early Warning Strengthening Project has created an enabling environment for coordination and partnership-building nec- essary for the development of \u2018end-to-end\u2019 and \u2018people-centred\u2019 early warning systems in the Indian Ocean region. However, the project activities are only the fi rst step for establishing a fully-fl edged TEWS within a multi-hazard framework. Strong political commitment of the Indian Ocean countries as well as substantial fi nancial and technical supports from the international community are crucial in achieving this goal.

Conclusion and recommendations The international, regional and national efforts in response to the 2004 tsunami dis- aster provided a sound basis for strength- ening early warning systems in the Indian Ocean region, including substantial progress toward the development of capacities and intergovernmental processes. Despite the challenges described above, the Early Warning Strengthening Project succeeded in achieving the original ob- jectives and intended outcomes of defi n- ing core technical elements of the TEWS for the Indian Ocean region, quickly setting up an interim warning system, establishing regional coordination mechanisms, start- ing the process of integrating early warning into national disaster risk reduction and pre- paredness efforts, raising public awareness, strengthening the role of communities and local authorities, and starting the resource mobilisation necessary for the establishment of fully fl edged TEWS within a multi-hazard framework. Substantial support is still needed to es- tablish the TEWS in the Indian Ocean region with a sound technical base and strength- ened community response. In order to real- ise the TEWS with a close linkage to other ocean-related hazards, the following actions are recommended: IOC of UNESCO (UNESCO/IOC), is an excel- lent example of cooperation between Mem- ber States, UN Agencies and donors. It has taken the decisions on the underlying tech- nologies to be employed, the mechanisms for regional governance, funding, coopera- tion and communications. One effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on the political landscape was that it drew more attention towards inclusion of disaster risk reduction as an important aspect of preparedness, re- sponse and recovery. The PPEW, UN/ISDR secretariat and the implementing partners will continue to sup- port the Indian Ocean countries through var- ious mechanisms to ensure sustainability of the project. Resource mobilisation for the development of fully-fl edged early warning systems as well as national platforms on disaster risk reduction and preparedness will continue through the Indian Ocean Tsunami Consortium, UNESCAP\u2019s Multi-donor Volun- tary Trust Fund on Tsunami Early Warning Arrangements in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia, and the Global Facility for Disas- ter Reduction and Recovery of the UN/ISDR and the World Bank and other efforts of the partner agencies and the UN/ISDR secre- tariat. The UN/ISDR regional offi ces in Asia and Africa will continue to provide techni- cal support in developing national plans and proposals in this regard. Regional coordina- tion for TEWS will continue mainly through ICG/IOTWS and technical support will con- tinue to be provided through the UNESCO/ IOC and WMO. The UN/ISDR-PPEW will also follow-up establishment of TEWS in the In- dian Ocean region within its follow-up ac- tivities for the International Early Warning Programme and the global multi-hazard ear- ly warning system mandated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007. Success stories Although occurrence of tsunamis and earthquakes was not frequent in 2006-2007, some success stories have already been re- ported by the partners to UN/ISDR-PPEW. The interim warning system established un- der the project has proven to be effective not only for tsunamis but also for other haz- ards. The UNESCO/IOC and WMO reported that the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) demonstrated its effectiveness during the July 2006 tsunami in Java. Interim tsu- nami advisory information was issued from the Pacifi c Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Several national warning centres in the In- dian Ocean region, including the one in Ja- karta, Indonesia, received interim tsunami advisory information from PTWC and JMA soon after the earthquake took place. The UNDP Sri Lanka offi ce reported that the en- hanced capacity for early warning and dis- semination as well as the in-country part- nership among relevant institutions saved some vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka during a landslide in January 2007. Final- ly, the UNESCO Jakarta offi ce reported that the Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) developed under the project in cooperation with a local NGO, were effectively applied ",
        "[ 131 ] Follow-up activities During 2007-2009, as a follow-up to the Tsunami Flash Appeal Project, an ISDR-co- ordinated initiative on building resilience to tsunamis in the Indian Ocean is being im- plemented with the support of the European Commission. This multi-partner initiative aims at building the resilience of communi- ties and nations to disasters by strengthening national and local institutions, mechanisms and capacities for disaster risk reduction in India, Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. A roundtable on Indian Ocean Tsuna- mi Warning and Response Systems was convened by UNESCO/IOC and the UN/ ISDR secretariat on 27 March 2006 in the margins of EWC III in Bonn and in the presence of President Clinton, the UN\u2019s Spe- cial Envoy for Tsunami Recovery. On the occasion of the roundtable, ISDR system partners formed a consortium to assist ini- tially up to ten governments with technical assistance to develop plans for an acceler- ated implementation of a national tsunami early warning system. The consortium part- ners include UNESCO/IOC, WMO, UNOCHA, IFRC, UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank, and is being coordinated by UN/ISDR-PPEW, ISDR regional offi ces in Bangkok and Nai- robi, and the ISDR secretariat in Geneva. By August 2006, 11 governments (Comoros, Madagascar, the Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Pakistan, Seychelles, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania specifi c conditions and context as the local capacity and socio-economic conditions differ from community to community; (cid:129) before the 26 December 2004 Tsunami, many of the countries in the Indian Ocean region did not have a well-organised dis- aster management system except some tropical cyclone-prone countries such as India and Bangladesh. Thus, National Dis- aster Management Offi ces in most coun- ties were very weak, and there were few established national platforms for disaster risk reduction in the region. The roles of the National Disaster Management Offi ces should be enhanced for better coordination within a country; (cid:129) constructing measures such as sea walls and shelters should be considered to pro- tect lives, properties and signifi cant infra- structures from tsunami. Currently, very few countries have implemented the struc- tural measures mainly due to lack of in- formation on risks. Countries need to have access to such information; (cid:129) accurate tsunami risk assessments based on paleo-tsunami research in the Indian Ocean region is needed. Suffi cient scien- tifi c information is not available on the historical occurrence of natural hazards in the region, except Indonesia for which some records are available for the last few hundred years. Research outcomes would facilitate policy-making process in each country. In addition, historical and geo- graphical research should be promoted to analyse what happened in the region in the past. (cid:129) the UN/ISDR, UNESCO/IOC, WMO as well as other UN, international and regional institutions working on early warning should continue their assistance to the In- dian Ocean countries in enhancing capaci- ties and mobilising resources necessary for both the establishment of the TEWS and of national platforms; (cid:129) to generate an enabling environment for TEWS in the Indian Ocean region, the UN/ ISDR secretariat, its regional offi ces and other members of the ISDR system should continue to assist the countries in Asia and Africa to establish and/or strengthen national platforms for disaster risk reduc- tion to effectively implement the Hyo- go Framework for Action. Low-capacity, high-risk countries require more interna- tional support; (cid:129) the regional coordination mechanism for the tsunami warning systems through the UNESCO/IOC ICG/IOTWS should be strengthened to ensure integration of tsu- nami early warning systems into national and regional mitigation, preparedness and response capability building efforts within a multi-hazard framework; (cid:129) understanding of vulnerability and risk should be deepened through strengthening the multi-sector approach. The methodolo- gies for multi-sector vulnerability assess- ment need to be further explored despite its complexity by building on the activities of the UNU-EHS undertaken under the Early Warning Strengthening Project.

        "[ 135 ] Post-war trauma and pain in Bosnia-Herzegovina A massacre by Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 was one the worst episodes of war in Europe since the Second World War. An estimated 8,000 Muslim men and teenage boys were murdered. The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague described the massacre as a genocide (April 2004). Since the end of the war, 18,000 victims (a majority Muslims) were exhumed from 300 mass graves in Bosnia-Herzegovina. About 6,000 bodies were disinterred from mass graves around Srebrenica. New mass graves are still expected to be found. Over 16,000 people are still consi- dered missing according to International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Nine years after the end of the war (1992-1995) the government of Republika Srpska said for the fi rst time that it \u2018sympathises with the pain of the relatives of the Srebrenica victims and expresses sincere regrets and apologies\u2019 (10 November 2004). The women of Srebrenica were the witnesses of this tragedy. In Potocari, the Serb forces segre- gated the civilian population into a group of men and teenage boys and a group of women and children. Some young girls were taken away, and they never returned. After two nights, women and children were forced into trucks. Men were found later with their throats slit. Thousands of Bosnian women are still searching for their sons, husbands and others relatives, and they are all waiting for the day when the remains of their loved ones will be found. Then fi nally they will be able to start the process of mourning. These women were greatly traumatised during the 1992-1995 war by constant exposure to violence. After the war ended their trauma became obvious. The effects of stress began mani- festing itself as a loss of self-confi dence, poor concentration, disturbed sleep, nightmares and the reliving of the traumatic experiences. Many are suffering from depression, withdrawal and have contemplated suicide. It was in the suburb of Sarajevo where I met these women from Srebrenica and the Drina Valley. There are 63 families; 221 women and children and only seven men. They live in a collective centre for refugees and are offered tenancy rights for fi ve years. In May 2005, they were faced with the risk of being expelled with force; once more suffering the pain of humiliation. They spend their time having coffee and cigarettes. In silence, in their minds they return to this terrible month of July 1995. They are still alive, but never will they smile again. I SABELLE E SHRAGHI ",

Af- ter the failure to agree on police reform in September 2007, the EU said \u201cenough, we won't force you into anything\u201d, which led to the change of heart among politicians. Suddenly, they started coming forward with their own initiatives. At the same time, it was also important to convince them that Europe would not be deaf and blind in the face of their successes. More generally, I believe that the EU ap- proach to the Western Balkans should be tailored to the specifi c situation and needs in each country. While progress towards the EU must be earned, we should also be realistic in our demands. The EU must be careful not set unrealistic requirements that countries can- not meet and which will discourage them. The EU must act as a motivating factor, but make clear that each step forward must be earned. The process of EU integration rests on transformation of a society and its ap- proximation to EU values and standards, and not on the formal status of a country\u2019s relationship with the EU. assurances do people have that there would be immediate intervention if violent confl ict was to break out again? Today\u2019s battles in BiH are fought at the po- litical level, and there is no danger of armed confl ict. It is the military\u2019s assessment that there has been no deterioration in the secu- rity situation. The environment is safe and secure and, as an example, we are seeing the freedom of the population to voice their po- litical views in public, en masse and in safety. There has been peace here since 1995. EUFOR is here to ensure that this peace remains in place, and it has plans for every eventuality. The European Union has deployed all types of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) instruments at its disposal in BiH: a military mission (EUFOR), a police mission (EUPM), and a civilian mission (EUSR). This is in stark contrast to 1991-1992, when the EU did not have the right instruments to address the un- folding Yugoslav crisis. The European Union initiated a Stabilisa- tion and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH on 4 December 2007. Until recently, pol- iticians in BiH did not seem to be bothered that their country was the last in the Western Balkans without this kind of link with the EU. What has changed and how should the EU respond to the new situation? For a long time, we had a paradoxical situ- ation in BiH. It really looked like the interna- tional community was pushing the country What hopes and ambitions did you have when taking on your current position as High Representative and EU Special Repre- sentative for Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH)? I took over my duties in July 2007 with the ambition of anchoring a politically and economically stable Bosnia and Herzegovi- na irrevocably on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration. You have previously said that you see di- plomacy as a \u201cscience\u201d. Is there a risk that a rational approach fails to address the war\u2019s legacy of human tragedy? During my fi rst few months in Bosnia, I had to spend a lot of time dealing with is- sues from the past. While I do understand the necessity for BiH and its constituent na- tions to come to terms with the past, I also fi rmly believe that politicians need to focus on the future and act as real leaders. Crimes cannot be undone, but those who committed them must be brought to justice. Only when victims have a feeling that justice has been served will they be able to come to terms with what has happened to them. So our task is two-fold: we must insist on justice for the victims, but at the same time, work on build- ing a better future for the country. Many in BiH feel that the international community failed them during the war. Has this caused some to be sceptical about what it can achieve in their country today?

I will not keep them both under the table and observe the situation with folded arms. Is the future of BiH high enough on the EU\u2019s political agenda? Why do you think it is almost non-existent in European media? The recent media focus on Kosovo/a is un- derstandable in view of the ongoing discus- sions about its future. Slovenia has indicated that the EU\u2019s relations with the Western Bal- kans will be in the focus of its Presidency. This will also be an opportunity to review our policies and adapt them where necessary. The challenge of creating a viable and stable country is probably much greater in Bosnia- Herzegovina than any other region of the Western Balkans. The Dayton Agreement ended the war in BiH, but it did not provide for the institutions needed to take the coun- try into the European Union. The challenge for the EU is to support and assist Bosnia- Herzegovina in the process of constitutional change, which is an absolute necessity if the country wants to integrate the EU. should not be linked to calls for a referen- dum on the secession of Republika Srpska. Was it wise for the EU to initial the SAA with Serbia while these calls continue to destabilise BiH? When Serbian offi cials tried to link the fate of Republika Srpska to the future of Kosovo/a, there was a rapid and fi rm re- sponse from the EU and the US. The interna- tional community said, in crystal-clear terms, that the future status of Kosovo/a would not have any effect on the constitutional setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as defi ned in Day- ton. Serbia has since stopped drawing such parallels and reiterated its commitment to the Dayton Peace Agreement and the ter- ritorial integrity of BiH. How far are you prepared to go to main- tain the territorial integrity of BiH and to improve the functioning of its institutions? Are the Bonn powers suffi cient to achieve your aims? The Bonn powers are a part of my man- date as High Representative of the interna- tional community. I have stressed from the beginning that I understand these powers as the yellow and red cards that a referee holds in his pocket during a football match. The best game is one when nobody notices the referee. That is how I view my role. However, I have also said that I will not refrain from using the powers of my offi ce to counter attempts to divert BiH from the right path. I prefer to support agreement among local politicians, but the international community also has a responsibility for this state. I have Some voices in the EU are calling for trade or partnership agreements as a preferable alternative to enlargement. What guarantees does BiH have that EU membership will be- come a reality if it achieves the necessary reforms? The EU has repeatedly stressed that it sees the future of the Western Balkans in the Eu- ropean Union. Of course, potential candi- dates must also fulfi l the criteria for mem- bership. There is unity among Member States on this issue, and BiH has no reason to doubt the EU\u2019s commitment as long as BiH deliv- ers on its own promises. By rewarding each step in the integration process, as it did when initialling the SAA with BiH, the EU can al- leviate any concerns and prove that genuine efforts will bring benefi ts. Russia has not hesitated in making clear its opposition to the independence of Kosovo/a. Is the continued lack of a coherent and unifi ed message from the EU a problem in the face of this? There is a general consensus among EU members on the way forward in Kosovo/a, so I would not subscribe to the view that our message lacks coherence and unity. As EUSR in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I have also made clear that there is not a single issue where Bosnia-Herzegovina depends on the future of Kosovo/a. BiH is not a hostage of Kosovo/a. The country has its own problems, and the solutions lie in the hands of its leaders. You have repeatedly insisted that any fu- ture declaration of independence by Kosovo/a ",
        "[ 151 ] Looking at the frozen confl icts in the South Caucasus one gets the impression that what is supposed to be confl ict resolution is actu- ally more a way of confl ict management. Do you see any movement at all? At this point in time, yes, the focus is on confl ict management and on confl ict pre- vention. At least this is the case of Georgia where the situation is rather tense, and in the case of Nagorny Karabagh [Nagorno- Karabakh] where the confl ict is as frozen as ever. However, the focus also is on confl ict transformation. Through the instruments that the EU now has at its disposal we can make proposals and offers that could change the outlook of the confl ict regions themselves. We have started to do this in Georgia where we have on the table a set of confi dence- building measures that have been worked with the different parties in the region. What are these measures and what differ- ence can they make for people in the con- fl ict regions? They, fi rst of all, involve the opening up some of the programmes under the ENP and in the Action Plan to people living in the confl ict regions. This will change their per- spectives; it will show them that there is a more complex environment, that there are other alternatives and additional possibilities to the two poles that they have been caught between for so long. It will make the aspira- on the other hand the EU can offer avenues of integration that fall short of membership but are still interesting and would still be noticeable for people in these countries. This could include visa facilitation, which would be noticeable for any citizen in this area. It could involve free trade, which would be no- ticeable for businesses in the countries. Has the EU enough to offer as long as ac- cession is excluded? Of course there are always desires and am- bitions that go beyond what is on offer. That is just natural; it is a healthy sign. But the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) con- tains quite a generous offer. It includes pos- sibilities that are far from exhausted in this region. We have just started in Georgia, Ar- menia and Azerbaijan to implement ambi- tious fi ve-year action plans that contain a wide-ranging transformation agenda. This is of course where the focus of attention should be in the next few years. If governments and societies in the region work diligently in ful- fi lling these tasks, it will make these coun- tries much more similar to the EU. This could be a very good and fi rm basis for the future, whatever it looks like. I cannot say if any kind of additional new institutional frame- work will be on offer sometime in the future. But if the countries in the South Caucasus be- come more similar to the EU\u2019s Member States then that would be a basis for a much closer and much more fruitful relationship. What kind of instruments does the Euro- pean Union have at its disposal to deal with the confl icts in the South Caucasus? First, there is the perspective that the EU itself represents a way of transforming the confl icts. The Georgian government, society and people living in confl ict regions are very interested in a close relationship with the EU and in what the EU can offer. They have been living for the better part of the last two dec- ades in a kind of cocoon without clear per- spective of their future. Making people in the confl ict regions share their visions and adapt them to a European context will eventually bring them closer together. How can this kind of common European identity be created? The EU can offer a layer of identity in ad- dition to the national identities. It can offer a framework for a more fruitful cooperation between neighbours by putting them into a larger framework. This includes the neigh- bours in the narrow South Caucasus region but also in the wider region with Russia and Turkey. This will bring both security to the region, which has been notoriously unstable and plagued by confl ict, and ultimately also prosperity. How can this objective be achieved even though EU accession is not an option at this point in time? EU membership is not on the agenda, but \u2018P RESERVING STATUS QUO IS DANGEROUS \u2019 I NTERVIEW WITH P ETER S EMNEBY Peter Semneby has been the European Union\u2019s Special Representative for the South Caucasus since 2006.

        "[ 152 ] is a very small and weak region with enor- mous differences between the countries \u2014 the region needs to be put into a larger context. Many of the problems that the South Cau- casus is facing are problems with the larger neighbours \u2014 with Russia, in particular for Georgia, and with Turkey, in particular for Armenia. The EU can play an important role in order to be a catalyst for a larger politi- cal framework. All these measures are essentially soft- power measures. Is that enough for success- ful confl ict resolution? In this context this approach has a very important advantage because the EU as a major soft-power actor should not be per- ceived as a threat by the parties of the con- fl icts. Soft-power measures can have quite a considerable infl uence. If the EU is able to build trust through its soft-power approach, it will also be in a better position to address the more traditional security challenges. As far as confl ict resolution is concerned, we have to keep the ultimate objective in mind: moving towards resolution of the con- fl ict and not falling into the trap of using our instruments to preserve a status quo that is dangerous and untenable in the long-run. Here the EU can play the role as a facilita- tor not least based on the fact that the EU is an authority that, in many ways, embodies the ambitions and aspirations of the parties to the confl icts. Finally, we will assist Georgia further in developing its minority policies, minority rights and social integration. Even where the problems may not be acute there is a need for attention to make sure that the development in those regions will be manageable in the future. It will also condition society in Geor- gia into making compromises and taking the necessary steps to fi nd a solution to the con- fl icts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. How can the EU manage to establish fruit- ful cooperation with Russia in this regard? We can engage with Russia and try to fi nd common interests in order to infl uence Mos- cow. But if there are aspects of Russian for- eign policy that we are not comfortable with, we should also be able to make that clear. In order to be heard in such a situation we have to have a broad relationship with Russia and use every opportunity for engagement. Russia will remain a neighbour of the South Caucasus; it will remain a part of the wider Black Sea region. Therefore, it is impossible to envisage any framework for this region without taking Russia into account. Since 1 January 2007, the EU is a Black Sea power in its own right with Romania and Bulgaria being littoral states of the Black Sea. This could increase our possibilities in linking up with Russia and with Turkey in a regional framework that may eventually sta- bilise the whole region. In order to address the problems of the South Caucasus \u2014 which tions of people living in the confl ict regions more similar to the aspirations of people liv- ing in Georgia proper. 1 And if we manage to make the mindsets and hearts of the political agendas similar in the confl ict regions and Georgia proper this will make an important contribution to transforming the confl icts. Measures could include the opening up of education exchange programmes to people in the confl icts regions. Which other channels will the EU use to step up its engagement? We also want to engage more directly in activities of various kinds that will create in- centives for contacts across the confrontation lines. Already a lot has been done in support for civil society and in assistance with in- frastructure development. We will continue along these lines as well as try to build joint interests between Georgia proper and the confl ict regions. We also envisage a larger EU presence in the confl ict regions by set- ting up information offi ces and deploying a few police liaison offi cers on the ground. This will have a reassuring impact and it will strengthen the message that there are new perspectives that people can refl ect on. It will also have a deterring impact and will raise the price of irresponsible action on all sides. If we develop our project-related activities then it will mean that there will be EU peo- ple on the ground and each such person has an important role. 1 Georgia\u2019s separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are not recognised by the international community.

We are also realising how the South Caucasus region relates to our other EU policies. Is the EU neglecting its eastern neighbour- hood and focusing too much on its southern neighbours? No, that is the wrong impression. There is no competition or contradiction between our engagement in Europe\u2019s eastern and southern regions. Both regions are important in their own right. Some challenges are the same, some are completely different. We have to realise that both are important regions, but that we also need to differentiate our policies by taking into account the particular issues that we face in these two regions. The South Caucasus, Ukraine and Moldova have their own specifi c character. They all emerged from the old Soviet Union; they have a very particular transformation agen- da and a very special geopolitical situation. However, they are neither less nor more im- portant than the Mediterranean. We have to take into account the specifi c character of each of these two regions and I expect more of this to be done. The European Commission has already presented a paper called \u2018Black Sea Synergy\u2019, which is an attempt to defi ne a policy that specifi cally addresses the par- ticular challenges in the region. Looking back at when you started your job in March 2006, would you say that there is a need for a more coherent EU policy for the South Caucasus? What are your ideas and visions? The South Caucasus has, for a long time, not fi gured in people\u2019s minds and therefore it has only recently been discovered by people in Europe. That includes decision-makers, EU politicians and administration in Brussels and in the European capitals. So there is a need for a lot of basic knowledge in order to understand the challenges that we are facing in this region. It is also a region where many other poli- cies and interests of the EU are involved. The relationship with Russia is one of those policies and it very much colours the Euro- pean vision on the South Caucasus. The need remains to defi ne how the South Caucasus relates to our policies with Russia, how our interests in the South Caucasus can be bal- anced with our interests in Russia. The importance of the region and our at- tention has increased for a number of rea- sons. First, the need for Europe to diversi- fy energy transportation routes and energy sources has dramatically increased the im- portance of the South Caucasus. Second, the political transformation that has taken place in Georgia since the Rose Revolution has also enhanced the attention Europe is paying to the region. So it is a matter of realising ",

If peacebuild- ing is ineffective, the decision-makers might lose the support of their communities, and if peacemaking is ineffective, the perceived disagreement that caused the confl ict will remain unresolved, and the probability that violence would start (again) soon is high. In this defi nition, peacekeeping is defi ned by its function \u2014 the lowering of the level of destructive behaviour, or more simply put, preventing violence. This function can be achieved by military as well as by non-mil- itary means.

On the concept of peacekeeping and its role in crisis response Since the Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali published his Agenda for Peace in 1992, the terms peace- keeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding have become well known. But it wasn't Boutros- Ghali who invented these terms but Johan Galtung, who 20 years before him called them \u2018approaches to peace\u2019. 1 Since then these terms have been refi ned by other authors. Together, these three approaches formulate a general theory of achieving or maintaining peace: \u2018With reference to the confl ict triangle, it can be suggested that peacemaking aims to change the attitudes of the main protagonists, peacekeping lowers the level of destructive behaviour, and peacebuilding tries to over- come the contradictions which lie at the root of the confl ict\u2019. 2 Unlike Boutros-Ghali, these peace research- ers emphasize that peacekeeping, peacebuild- ing and peacemaking need to be applied at the same time, not subsequently, as in Boutros- Ghali\u2019s model. Peacekeeping without peace- making and peacebuilding would be very Introduction There is a widely shared consensus today within the European Union and its Member States that the use of civilian specialists is needed in crisis management and human se- curity. Less acceptable, however, may be the thought that direct peacekeeping tasks could be undertaken by civilians rather than by armed forces, and that this may be an option to consider in cases where there is neither the political will nor the capacity or the ac- ceptance by the country in confl ict to deploy armed forces or international police. In addition, even if political and fi nancial constraints do not prevent the sending of a peacekeeping force, does it always have to be a military force? This question may sound a bit provocative in a context where the al- most unquestioned paradigm is that military protection is the only way protection can be achieved, but as I would like to show in this contribution there are examples of initia- tives moving in this direction and achieving results by it. The examples that follow are taken from different places of the world where unarmed civilian peacekeeping undertaken by interna- tional (and often also local) civilians is making C IVILIAN PEACEKEEPING : HOW CIVILIAN INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AT GRASSROOTS LEVEL CONTRIBUTE TO HUMAN SECURITY AND STABILITY Christine Schweitzer is a trained social anthropologist; she was born in 1959 and lives and works in Hamburg, Germany.

In our analysis, there is a double mecha- nism of protection at work here as in regard to the work of international civilian peace- keepers: they are providing the \u2018eye and ear of the world\u2019, and being outsiders, are able to talk to all sides of the confl ict without being seen as partisan. Their own security is based on the trust the local communities and the civil society partners of NP give the interna- tional peacekeepers. The result is a relation- ship of mutual support and protection, with its outcome being an increase of the impact the joint peacekeeping efforts have. Nonviolent Peaceforce in Sri Lanka NP launched its fi rst project in Sri Lanka in Cessation of Hostilities (CCCH), local moni- toring teams, an international monitoring team staffed mostly by Malaysia, and an ad hoc joint action group. The CCCH has set up Monitoring Posts in the confl ict areas, which are manned by government and MILF sol- diers as well as with representatives of local civil society initiatives. The extraordinary feature of this setup is the close involve- ment of several hundred local civil society peacekeepers who mostly work in a volun- tary capacity. These local peace groups have invited NP to send an international team to provide sup- port and protective presence to local groups working to enhance civil society initiatives and prevent violence. Benefi ciaries of the project are the vulnerable communities, indi- viduals and civil society groups whose lives and work are threatened by the continuing violence or threat of violence, in particular women and children. Nonviolent Peaceforce sent its fi rst team of six peole to Mindanao in May 2007. In the few months of their work, they have been able together with local groups to work suc- cessfully on several smaller and larger in- cidents in central Mindanao as well as the Sulu archipelago, including Basilan, helping to prevent such incidents leading to full- scale military confrontation. The tasks of NP teams are: with the goal to develop unarmed peace- keeping, in the sense of having direct impact for the human security of popula- tions caught in an armed confl ict through the presence of large numbers of interna- tional trained professionals using purely non-violent means. 3 For over 30 years, more than 120,000 lives have been lost in the struggle for independ- ence waged by Muslim groups against the Christian majority in Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines. The main guerrilla group, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), signed a peace treaty with the Philippines Government in 1996. MNLF leaders joined the government structures in Mindanao, mainly in the then newly created Autonomous Region of Mus- lim Mindanao (ARMM). But another group that split from MNLF, the Moro Islamic Lib- eration Front (MILF), continued the fi ght and it took many years and several cease- fi re agreements before fi ghting more or less stopped, with violent incidents still occur- ring in central Mindanao. Negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement are cur- rently being conducted. The ceasefi re is being monitored by an offi cial mechanism that includes both the government and the MILF and has four ele- ments: the Coordinating Committee on the 3 NP is a federation or organisation of about 85 member organisations (mostly groups with an explicit non-violent action or resistance background) from all continents.

Balkan Peace Team The Balkan Peace Team (BPT) was an international volunteer project work- ing in Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1994 and 2001. 4 Its man- date was broader than that of NP although it shared with the goal of opening space for local actors rather than being one of the countless NGOs in the area following their own agendas and doing their own externally planned projects. Protection and support- ing of dialogue were its two focuses, with protection being more important in Croatia, and the support of dialogue at the civil so- ciety level among activists from Serbia and Kosovo/a. 5 Many activities of BPT in Croatia had to do with human security (though that term was nearly unknown then). The teams accompanied local human rights activists on many of their missions, be it to prevent the illegal eviction of people of the \u2018wrong' ethnicity from their fl ats, or monitoring the situation in newly reintegrated Croatian Krajina after 1995. In the Krajina this in- ternational presence was intended to deter harassment and worse (arson, killings) of NGOs and UN agencies such as UNICEF and UNHCR. It has played key roles in resolving disputes among ethnic and other groups, se- curing the release of child soldiers, providing a protective presence in Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps, at temple festivals, and monitoring the delivery of aid to tsunami-af- fected areas, accompanying local aid workers who are under threat in certain areas. A major element of the work aside from accompaniment, presence and monitoring is linking people to authorities or agencies, as well as training and dialogue at the com- munity level. Neither of the last three would fall under \u2018peacekeeping\u2019 if that was defi ned as a purely dissociative approach. But since the goal of most of these activities has been to increase people\u2019s well-being by helping them to get access to aid, or solving confl icts that would otherwise likely lead to communal violence and killings, and helping civil soci- ety groups to come together to develop their own activities against violence and human rights violations, they are part of a strategy to provide human security. Also, NP staff security is also based on the acceptance and trust by the local communi- ty and also on their international linkages, while the source of its impact is in being non- partisan outsiders with intimate knowledge of the communities in which they work, and late 2003 at the invitation of and in partner- ship with local groups. Sri Lanka is of course no longer an example of a country moving from a ceasefi re to real peace. The ceasefi re agreement from 2002 that was meant to end almost 20 years of war has de facto broken down and the situation is characterised by open warfare between the government and the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) fi ghting for independ- ence of those parts of Sri Lanka where Tamils are a majority. NP in Sri Lanka (NPSL) consists of fi ve teams comprising of 25 internationally re- cruited fi eld team members (the majority from countries from the Global South), ap- plying unarmed peacekeeping methods such as protective accompaniment, mediation, ob- serving and reporting in volatile areas in the north and east of Sri Lanka. Their objectives are to prevent or reduce the level and poten- tial for violence; support and improve the safety, confi dence and ability of Sri Lankan peacemakers and other civilians to address confl ict in non-violent ways; and work with Sri Lankans to provide human security and deter resumption of violent confl ict.

        "[ 158 ] These different functions BPT was able to play because it was an international project. And in many instances its effi ciency can probably be explained by the deterrence the- ory. But there is one important modifi cation: The former Yugoslavia was an arena with a multitude of international interveners, many and the most conspicuous of them being backed by military force-though until 1995 of a limited sort and not being entitled to enforce its protective mandate. BPT made a point of distancing itself from the interven- tions of the international community both on the symbolic level and on the practical by seeking dialogue rather than invoking the threat of international power, and striving to be tolerated in the countries by keeping a low profi le. So while it certainly profi ted from this power, its approach was different from that of the NGO Peace Brigades Interna- tional, and the sources of its infl uence were different from the rest of the international community which had a sort of clout. Unarmed peacekeeping by governmental missions There are a large number of other projects, organisations and initiatives by civil society involved in non-violent peacekeeping ini- tiatives. 6 Neither BPT nor NP have been the fi rst, and the reason why they have been singled out as examples lies solely in the author\u2019s personal involvement with these three examples.

As internationals, BPT had more freedom of movement between the confl ict areas than local NGOs \u2014 be- tween Croatia and Krajina, between Serbia and Kosovo/a, between Croatia and FR Yugoslavia. This placed the organisation in the posi- tion to support dialogue between organi- sations, and eventually to arrange meet- ings. The meetings between Serbian and Kosovan students and activists that BPT mediated have had a very different char- acter from other dialogue meetings be- cause they did not happen abroad (as most dialogue projects prefer), but they accom- panied people visiting each other in their own towns, which gave the participants a much bigger feeling of ownership over the meeting than any international workshop can do; (cid:129) carrying out an active advocacy role. BPT alerted other international organisations about, for example, the policy of Croatia regarding refugees from Bosnia-Herze- govina (especially the town of Bihac); the sometimes less-than-helpful role the UN protection forces (UNPROFOR) played in Croatia; the situation in the Krajina and Eastern Slavonia; the situation in Kosovo/a after the war of 1999 when local experts were picked up by international organi- sations that were able to pay them much better. those Serbs who remained behind after the reoccupation. All internal assessments as well as the study by M\u00fcller done later on the project confi rm that the presence made a dif- ference at those places they regularly went. BPT was an experiment in combining sev- eral roles that other projects tended to keep apart. Unlike many peacebuilding projects, it focused on human security/protection (civil peacekeeping) without rigidly limiting its role to this one aspect. It also allowed itself to get involved in a large variety of peace- building activities without feeling that doing so it would lose its character or endanger its non-partisanship. The ways in which BPT made a differ- ence included: (cid:129) serving a preventive function in regard to potential human rights violations; (cid:129) fulfi lling a mediating role between local NGOs and international organisations or NGOs. In Croatia, BPT teams were often called upon because, as an international NGO, it had easier access to other \u2018interna- tionals\u2019 than local activists. Unfortunately, this was not only a question of language, but also whether internationals were pre- pared to take local groups seriously; (cid:129) serving as a bridge between local NGOs or private citizens and local authorities in the same way as NP does in Sri Lanka; 6 See Christine Schweitzer (ed.), Nonviolent Peaceforce \u2014 Feasibility study, contributions by Donna Howard, Mareike Junge, Corey Levine, Christine Schweitzer, Carl Stieren and Tim Wallis.

It does not only affect the decision-makers \u2014 those at the top of the line of command \u2014 but also the individual perpetrator: We should not assume that the thugs who pull the trigger are unaffected by in- ternational presence. No one wants an un- expected witness around when they are carrying out a crime. The volunteer\u2019s pres- ence may have a moral infl uence on indi- vidual perpetrators. It also introduces an uncertainty factor \u2014 the attacker does not know what the consequences of this wit- ness will be, so unless he has explicit or- ders that take the accompaniment into ac- count, he is likely to restrain himself rather than risk getting in trouble with his superior. (Mahony op. cit.: 8) According to Mahony (op. cit.:18) a series of conditions must be met in order for this deterrence to \u2018work\u2019: 1. There must be a clear source of the threat. 2. The perpetrator has to be sensitive to in- ternational pressure, and the accompaniers have to gauge how much sensitivity there is. The assumption of this theory is that the location. From there they go out to patrol in the villages to explain the ceasefi re agree- ment and through their presence prevent new violence. How does civilian peacekeeping work? The theory of non-violent deterrence Liam Mahony and Luis Enrique Eguren in 1997 and Liam Mahony in 2004 8 described a theory of deterrence without threat of arms; a deterrence based on the concern a confl ict party has for its international image: International accompaniment can suc- ceed in deterring attacks because the de- cision-makers behind these attacks sel- dom want a bad international image. They don\u2019t want the world to know about what they are doing. They don\u2019t want diplomats making them uncomfortable mentioning hu- man rights problems in their meetings. They don\u2019t want to read in the international press that they are being called monsters or crimi- nals. They will avoid all that if they can. (Mahony op. cit.: 7) Mahony and Eguren describe that the protective effect of international presence is one of an indirect threat \u2014 the threat with an international reaction in case an attack or human rights violation occurs in the presence of the international monitor/ But there have also been, and still are, civilian missions sent out by governments or international organisations whose man- date does include or is even fully focused on protection, such as UN Monitoring Mis- sions. Many missions by the OSCE can be considered to belong to this category. An interesting example is the Truce/Peace Monitoring Mission that was set up in Bou- gainville 7 , an island that belonged to Pa- pua New Guinea (PNG). Starting in 1988 Bougainville went through a serious civil war between the Bougainville Revolution- ary Army, fi ghting for the independence of the island from PNG and the PNG defence forces supported by Australia. The war was brought to an end by two agreements in 1997 and 1998, and as part of the agree- ments an unarmed Truce Monitoring Group (TMG) was established. In 1997, under the leadership of the New Zealand military, ap- proximately 370 soldiers and civilians from New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu were sent to Bougainville to monitor the ceasefi re and the implementation of the agreement. All members of the TMG had to be unarmed and wear civilian clothes, as an armed peacekeeping force would have been refused by the parties in confl ict. The operation was set up according to military standards and rules, using a military infra- structure and approach.

Mobilisation is sharing information in a discreet way with selected people, bodies or states that have the capacity to infl u- ence the authorities to satisfy their ob- ligations and to protect individuals and groups exposed to violations. 4.

Unarmed approaches to human security Human security refers to freedom for in- dividuals from basic insecurities caused by gross human rights violations, and is dis- tinguished from state security. 9 Human se- curity widens the understanding of security to include other threats than those from an invading army, and includes protection of human rights as well as provision for other basic needs. Looking at how NGOs provide human se- curity, Hugo Slim and Luis Enrique Eguren 10 distinguish fi ve main modes of action: 1. Denunciation is pressuring authorities through public disclosure into meeting their obligations and protecting individu- als or groups exposed to abuse. 2. Persuasion is convincing the authorities through further private dialogue to fulfi l their obligations and to protect individu- als and groups exposed to violations. perpetrator makes an assessment of costs and benefi ts and then decides that the per- ceived costs are higher than the benefi ts. 3. The organisation has to have the lever- age to exert pressure, which is achieved by making itself known to all levels of the military and civilian authorities, and through a global emergency alert network adding grassroots pressure. 4. The abusing party must know of the presence of the accompaniers and their power. 5. The accompaniment and the activist have to communicate clearly to the aggressor what types of actions are unacceptable. 6. The aggressor must believe that an or- ganisation is capable of carrying out its resolution. Accompaniment or non-violent peace- keeping alters the political space local ac- tivists have. Mahony and Eguren describe in detail the problems that go with widen- ing space because there may be a difference between perceived and real space. So in the worst case scenario the presence of interna- tionals may also cause a false perception of space that is not really there, thereby mak- ing people take risks they should not take. 9 A Human Security Doctrine for Europe.

        "[ 161 ] The costs of civilian peacekeeping are probably much lower than that of military peacekeeping because it requires less infra- structure and less hardware. If carried out professionally, it may also have fewer un- desired side-effects, such as having a popu- lation already traumatised by many years of war and being faced with new heavily armed soldiers. There is of course still an enormous task ahead. Currently civilian peacekeeping often lacks political support; initiatives involved in it have to struggle for funding (often through budget lines that are not really in- tended for this purpose); civilian personnel, if sent by civil society, cannot expect the same kind of framework support as soldiers or police can \u2014 they most often have to give up their work at home with no right to re- claim the job they left. They also don\u2019t enjoy unemployment, pension or other insurance through state schemes, and the recruitment and training of qualifi ed staff is only at its infancy. inwards - not outwards - to the international world. The focus of the Indian Shanti Sena is and was convincing to those ready to apply violence, and strengthened the communities to resist that violence using methods of dia- logue, counteracting rumours, physical in- ter-positioning and aid and reconstruction. Conclusions This article has tried to argue that civilian peacekeeping is an effi cient instrument in dealing with potential violence in the vola- tile initial time after a ceasefi re ends open warfare in a country. Of course, it cannot enforce peace, but then again: how good and convincing is the record of military peace- keeping really in doing so? Civilian peacekeeping is used in at least two different scenarios: on invitation by civil society groups who use non-violent means of dealing with confl ict, or as an out- come of offi cial negotiations when one or both sides reject a military force for what- ever reason. clearly different mechanisms: persuasion de- fi ned as making authorities act at their own accord, and substitution, defi ned as the NGO acting in place of the authorities. As described in the three examples above, there is one major factor other than deter- rence at play in unarmed civilian peace- keeping: the relationship the non-partisan civilian peacekeepers build with the local community, and the trust resulting from this relationship. Perhaps the best examples aside from those quoted above are the effective work of local or national initiatives. Probably the best-known examples are the Pakistani and Indian \u2018peace armies\u2019 as developed by Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Gandhi, and a number of local peace teams or peace monitoring mis- sions that can be found in such different countries as Croatia, Indonesia, the Philip- pines, Sri Lanka and of course India today. 11 Their effectiveness is mainly derived from respect in the community, being centred 11 See NP Feasibility Study 2001 a.a.O., and the literature references given there.

        "[ 163 ] forewarners and coordinators. Several or- ganisations have been established to coor- dinate relief work or development aid but none of them covers the whole scope of action. Furthermore, coordination is not understood in the same way by everyone, because many actors have well-founded reasons to act separately from each oth- er. Organisations may also see each other as competitors, for example, because they have the same funding sources or a differ- ent ideological or religious approach. The common denominator accepted by all actors is open and voluntary sharing of information between organisations. It is considered to be benefi cial to all parties. However, so far there has been no gener- ally accepted concept and no user-friend- ly collaboration tool. Even in crisis areas the Information Communication Technol- ogy (ICT) possibilities used in information sharing have been limited. The problem is triple- headed: potential users feel uncom- fortable with systems owned by somebody else, all organisations want to preserve their freedom of action and the existing collaboration tools are limited in one way or another. Finland has in turn taken a leading role in fi nancing and developing a user friendly ICT tool suitable for information sharing in between civilian and military efforts in peacebuilding. The problem and its solution Almost everyone involved has gradually admitted that lack of coordination is one of the key problems in crisis management. Over time the prevalent way of thinking has begun to emphasize a comprehensive ap- proach in all peace efforts: from preventa- tive measures and peacebuilding to hard- core crisis management. Main actors such as the EU encourage creating partnerships that enhance cooperation between organi- sations \u2014 even if that may not necessarily lower the walls between different organi- sational alliances. Hundreds of independent organisations may still be working in the same major cri- sis area without very much knowledge of each other\u2019s actions or experiences. Many of them may have pieces of information, seemingly valueless but important to some- body else, but they do not know what they know. More importantly, such small pieces of information when collected and analysed may form an adequate early warning sys- tem that triggers successful preventative action in the international community. The result of this analysis is not new, as many great organisations already work as Introduction After the Cold War, NATO tried to fi nd its new role in the changed world and be- came more involved in crisis management. Twelve years ago NATO sent its troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, a mission which UN peacekeepers had failed to complete. NATO\u2019s intervention was effective and the situation was brought under control. As a result of its self-evaluation and develop- ment work, NATO had created a vision of comprehensive crisis management in which all parties would work towards the same goal. All that was needed was coordination, and that was tested in Sarajevo 1996. \u2018It was like forcing wild cats into the same cage,\u2019 described an offi cer who was a member of the coordination group. Actors involved in civilian crisis management, let alone different organisations, felt very distressed about all military coordination attempts as they were afraid that soldiers would take control. Some of the organi- sations even had a legitimate reason to remain completely neutral in their rela- tions to others. In the worst case scenario the results gained for attempting to dic- tate to crisis management organisations, international organisations and the broad spectrum of NGOs were possibly more cha- otic than those gained from random meth- ods.

The solution based on well-developed information sharing can also be applied at strategic-political level as an early warning tool, whereas present research and model- ling focus on fi eld-level work. It is believed that common situational awareness helps to minimise overlapping functions, to identify common objectives or operational needs, to locate any gaps in action and to increase security. SHIFT in short The SHIFT environment promotes the situ- ational awareness of all the actors in crisis management, namely, military and civil au- thorities, international organisations, NGOs and local actors. SHIFT is not owned by any of the authorities or the interested actors. A SHIFT organisation, for example, a par- ticular association dedicated to providing SHIFT services, does not have any opera- tional ambitions; instead, it provides differ- ent actors with a forum for open informa- tion sharing. SHIFT is accessible via the internet and provides authorised users with a wide range of ITC services, such as a portal, virtual meet- ings and the \u2018Shiftpedia\u2019 where up-to-date and user-relevant information is gathered, just as in the Wikipedia. SHIFT technology includes a situation picture that all actors a programme focusing on multinational de- velopment and experiments. It pays special attention to the civil\u2013military interface \u2014 a well-needed learning process interlinking the US military with European thinking. When enhancing the SHIFT concept, it is important to establish what the role of the security authorities is as well as what the need is for information sharing between public authorities who carry out the imme- diate reconstruction work and those who develop democracy on a long-term basis. Furthermore, the solution is not credible un- less, in addition to public authorities, non- governmental actors involved in crisis man- agement make a considerable input to its development. Only an open approach can create the critical mass of users needed to gain maximum synergy benefi ts. SHIFT focuses fi rst on designing an op- erating model and developing a technology that supports the concept of open informa- tion sharing. At the same time it encourages participants to transfer to a new kind of in- formation management environment where open information sharing adds value to all participants. As a technology, SHIFT examines informa- tion fl ows between different actors and the use of new internet services in crisis man- agement, such as network meetings and us- er-created wiki pages. In addition, common graphics and a data model for visualising and sharing situation pictures of crisis areas any crisis area. The Finnish Government\u2019s aim is to provide its solution to the inter- national community as a free, open frame- work and tested technology. The project is called Shared Information Framework and Technology; SHIFT. It is both an operating model and an internet service together with programmes. The project aims to create an environment that is not owned by any of the organisa- tions involved but which serves them all. The SHIFT organisation has no other inter- est than to create a collaboration platform. Only against this background can we try to achieve new unbiased and diverse synergy. Credible enough to be used Developers fi nancing the project are the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minis- try of Defence and Ministry of the Interior. In Finland these actors cover both civilian and military crisis management, develop- ment cooperation, security matters and res- cue services. The Finnish Defence Force is responsible for the practical implementation of the SHIFT vision. Civilian partners include Crisis Management Initiative (CMI), Helsinki University of Technology and the Futures Research Centre in the Turku School of Eco- nomics.

For the situation picture, a culture independent \u2014 or as universal as possible \u2014 set of symbols has been devel- oped. The situation picture is considered to be self-sustainable because it is, as a rule, in the interests of all actors that the pic- ture is accurate. However, the open system may also leave the way open to misuse. This is why the developers have carefully examined how to prepare for misuse in the right way. At national level, the SHIFT principle and technology have been used in preparedness exercises like the Barents Rescue 07 exer- cise in the wilderness of Lapland.

        "[ 167 ] Introduction This article deals with the poorly un- derstood and as yet inadequately concep- tualised phenomenon of the unintended consequences of peace operations. We now know from recent literature, public criticism and international debate that some unin- tended consequences, for instance sexual abuse and exploitation, can be extremely damaging to individuals and communities where peacekeepers are deployed. These un- intended consequences and others, such as the impact of a rapid and large external intervention on a fragile host society and economy, can weaken the ability of a peace operation to achieve its intended objectives. In fact, some unintended consequences can harm the very concept of peace operations and undermine the legitimacy of the or- ganisations that are responsible for their deployment. Our aim is to improve our understand- ing of how unintended consequences come about, and to explore ways in which those planning and managing peace operations can improve their ability to anticipate, mitigate and manage potential unintended U NINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF PEACEKEEPING Cedric De Coning is a Research Fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD).

The overall purpose of this article is to contribute to the improvement of peace operations. Traditional peacekeep- ing was intended to have a neutral impact on the ceasefi res or peace agreements they were mandated to observe. They were not meant to have any impact on the future direction of the peace process other than to bolster the fragile peace that existed by monitoring the status quo. 1 In the post-Cold War era, however, the focus of peace op- erations has gradually shifted from peace- keeping to peacebuilding, in that they have become complex, integrated, whole-of-gov- ernment, multifaceted operations aimed at supporting and facilitating the implemen- tation of comprehensive peace agreements. 2 This modifi cation in the role and scope of, especially United Nations (UN), peace opera- tions has taken place over the last decade and a half and has exposed peace operations to a new range of potential unintended con- sequences it has not had to manage before. We consider peace operations to be an in- dispensable instrument in the international confl ict management toolbox. It is therefore in our collective interest to learn lessons from both our successes and failures. The authors of this article co-edited a vol- ume under the same title and this article is meant to share the insights gained from that study with the broader peacekeeping community. 3 What do we mean by \u2018unintended consequences\u2019? No intervention in a complex system like a human society can have only one effect. Complex systems are dynamic and respond to interventions in a non-linear fashion. 4 We may be able to anticipate some of the ways in which a complex system will respond to an intervention, including the responses we intended to stimulate through our interven- tion. However, the system will also respond in ways that we could not anticipate. 5 Those reactions that fall outside the scope of the response we intended to elicit are the unin- tended consequences of our intervention. If we accept that unintended consequences are a natural outcome of the dynamic na- ture of complex systems, then we also have to recognise that they cannot be avoided altogether. This implies that we should an- ticipate that despite our best efforts to limit 1 Lester B. Pearson, quoted in Brian Urquhart, Hammarskjold .

The unintended consequences of a peace operation are those effects, outcomes and impacts that have come about as a result of the operation but that were not intended in the mandate of the operation, nor in its im- plementation. UN \u2013 authorised peace opera- tions have mandates that are formulated in the form of a UN Security Council resolution. The intended consequences of these opera- tions can be determined by analysing these resolutions. Some unintended consequences should have been foreseen or anticipated, especial- ly if they have occurred under similar cir- cumstances in the past, while others may be totally unexpected. These nuances may have important implications and will be dis- cussed in more detail. It is also important to note that not all unintended consequences are necessarily negative; some may be neu- tral and others may actually be positive. Our focus will, however, be on the negative un- intended consequences, because they are the harmful to the local communities that peace operations are intended to serve, harmful to the very notion of international peace inter- ventions aimed at supporting and facilitat- ing local peace processes, and harmful to the organisations that mandate and deploy such operations. A few qualifi cations need to be made. First, unintended consequences need to be distin- guished from failure to achieve intended con- sequences. 6 Second, unintended consequences need to be distinguished from the \u2018mixed mo- tive' phenomenon in intervention decisions. We accept states participating in peace op- erations may have motives for supporting such operations other than those stated in the formal mandate of the operation. We do not consider such mixed motives to be unin- tended consequences of peace operations. We do recognise, however, that they may cause or aggravate unintended consequences and will then be addressed in that context. The scope of \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 It is also important to note at the outset that the fact that this article is devoted to un- intended consequences is not meant to sug- gest that this phenomenon occurs at a scale that implies that peace operations are doomed to failure. We argue that peace operations will always generate some consequences that will be unintended, but we do not address the frequency or scope of such unintended con- sequences in this article. We were unable to make a meaningful assessment of the overall scale and impact of unintended consequences in peace opera- tions, and further research will be needed before any defi nitive fi ndings can be made in this regard. If we use the cases covered in our study 7 as a sample, there are no missions that have failed as a direct result of the un- intended consequences they have generated. There are many, however, whose effective- ness has been negatively affected by some of the unintended consequences they have generated. And there are some that have generated consequences far beyond specifi c peace operations. The sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers of those that they have been mandated to protect, has undermined the credibility of the UN, its Secretary General and of peace operations as an international confl ict management instrument. Albert Hirschman points out that straight- forward effects, i.e. intended consequences, are common and often dominate perverse ones. 8 Jervis argues that if this were not the case, it would be hard to see how soci- eties can make progress or how any stable human interaction could develop. 9 In oth- er words, the fact that unintended conse- quences will occur does not render futile the whole enterprise of mandating, planning and 6 For a critical view of strategic effectiveness of peacekeeping deployments see Richard Betts, \u2018Delusion of Impartial Intervention\u2019, Foreign Affairs , November/December 1994.

        "[ 169 ] managing peace operations. The central mes- sage of this article is that we have to rec- ognise that unintended consequences are a predictable side-effect of peace operations. They should therefore be factored into the mandating, planning and managing of peace operations so that their potential effects can be anticipated and managed. Why is the focus of unintended consequences new? We were struck by the absence of liter- ature on, or even remotely related to, the phenomenon of unintended consequences of peace operations. Most of the references that were available are anecdotal. The fail- ure to take unintended consequences into account probably stems from the fact that researchers and practitioners have been pre- occupied with the intended consequences of peace operations. We have been concerned with improving the ability of peace operations to achieve their intended objectives. We have stud- ied peace operations to fi nd out whether they have been successful, and in measur- ing their success our focus has usually been on whether they have achieved the man- dates with which they were tasked. Where they were not, we focused on what could have been done differently to make them successful. However, a number of incidents have come to our collective attention over the last decade and a half that made us re- alise that peace operations can also generate unintended consequences. Liberal assumptions about peace operations This lack of attention to and awareness of the unintended consequences of peace op- erations is also due to deeply embedded and uncritical liberal assumptions about peace operations. 10 Not only are peace operations expected to serve largely liberal-interna- tionalist purposes of creating stable, mar- ket-oriented, democratic polities, 11 which are regarded as inherently \u2018good\u2019, but they are at the same time expected to be successful. Decision-makers, practitioners in the fi eld and analysts operate according to the belief that peace operations authorised by the Se- curity Council refl ect the will of the interna- tional community and therefore are inher- ently \u2018good\u2019. Peace operations are therefore expected to produce positive outcomes such as promoting stability and durable peace; they are expected to rebuild and develop and they are expected to generate respect for the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Participation in peace operations by troop- contributing countries is thus a contribution to the global good and the risks involved, including casualties, is regarded as a noble sacrifi ce for the greater good. 12 After the failures of the missions in the early 1990s in Somalia, the Balkans and Rwanda, the liberal assumption has been tempered to accept that peace operations may, for a variety of reasons, fail to produce these intended results. Some may even con- cede, after the highly publicised sexual abuse scandals, that peace operations may, under exceptional circumstances, have unintended consequences. But such incidents have been viewed as exceptional, once off, phenomena, caused by a handful of \u2018bad apples\u2019 acting outside the norm. The liberal assumption has not yet matured to the extent where it is rec- ognised that peace operations, as a matter of course, generate unintended consequences, including negative economic, social and po- litical side-effects that are contrary to the liberal intent. It has not yet absorbed that unintended consequences come about as part of the non-linear and dynamic behaviour of complex systems, and are thus a systemic consequence of peace interventions. The fact that peace operations will gener- ate a variety of unintended consequences, some of which may be negative and even pathological to the mandate or intended con- sequences of the mission, is thus counter- 1 0 For the classic critique of the liberal agenda of modernisation, see Samuel Huntington, Political Order in Changing Societies .

This would explain, for instance, why human traffi cking seems to thrive in post-confl ict societies. 14 Impact on local economy The deployment of a peace operation, in- volving tens of thousands of international ci- vilian, police and military peacekeepers over a relatively short period of time, have vari- ous positive and negative effects on the host system. It most cases considered in our study, the presence of the peace operation, humani- tarian community and other external actors making up the expatriate community dis- torted the local economy and stimulated the development of a dual economy, one which served the needs of the expatriate community and another that served the local population. In general, the impact the expatriate commu- nity is likely to have on the host system is related to the degree of poverty that existed in that society at the time of the intervention, and the extent of the devastation caused by the confl ict. In most cases the budget of the peace operation alone is several times that of the GDP of the host system. The direct ef- fect on the host system, fi nancially speaking, is limited to the funds injected by the peace operation, and the peacekeepers individually, into the host system. intuitive to many observers under the infl u- ence of the liberal assumption. This article aims to stimulate awareness that all peace operations generate \u2018unintend- ed consequences\u2019, so that it becomes com- mon practise for decision-makers, practition- ers and researchers to anticipate, mitigate, manage and respond to potential unintended consequences in the planning, execution and evaluation of peace operations. Examples of unintended consequences If we accept that unintended consequences are likely to occur, and that they can have a signifi cant impact on the outcome and im- pact of a peace operation, then we have to improve our ability to anticipate and take steps to try to prevent some of the negative unintended consequences. In others we may have to be satisfi ed with merely containing and managing the potential negative effects of these unintended consequences. And if we manage to do so with some success, the re- sult should be an improvement in the overall effectiveness of peace operations. In this context it may be useful to discuss a few examples of unintended consequences. Our study covered a number of other top- ics related to the unintended consequenc- es of peace operations, such as: sexual and gender-based violence and abuse, distor- tions of the local economy, impact on host systems, impact on humanitarian action, civil\u2014military coordination, impact on troop contributing countries, the legal position of the United Nations and institutional re- sponses to unintended consequences by the UN and others. For the purposes of this ar- ticle we have grouped some of the major fi ndings generated by the study under the following topics: permissive environment, impact on local economy, impact on local civil service, and impact on troop contrib- uting countries. Permissive environment The breakdown of law and order, socio- economic infrastructure and social-cultural norms, the prevailing post-confl ict condi- tion in which most peace operations oper- ate, create a fertile ground for unintended consequences to occur. A breakdown of this nature implies that the natural checks and balances that would otherwise identify, con- tain and manage potential negative effects are absent. For instance, it is now recognised that sexual and gender-based violence is of- ten part of a conscious strategy to demor- alise the opposing side in a confl ict. Kent argues that such violence can become insti- tutionalised in post-confl ict societies when the conditions that created the violence re- main in place. 13 She points out that extreme poverty, lack of economic opportunity, lack of employment and the loss of family and community support networks, all account 13 V.

        "[ 171 ] Ammitzboell\u2019s research in Afghanistan and Kosovo/a found positive evidence that large expatriate communities have a range of un- intended economic consequences on their host systems, most of which have a negative effect on the host economy. 15 These effects may range from, but are not limited to, a rise in basic commodity prices, an increase in sal- ary disparities and higher rates of unequal standards of living. Ammitzboell points out that peace operations may have a positive impact on the local economy by creating job opportunities and by increasing or creating a demand for certain services and goods, but cautions that this impact will not necessarily result in the enhancement of local infrastruc- tures or capacities, as much of this addition- al demand is taken up by the international private sector. A large portion of this eco- nomic stimulation is linked to the temporary deployment of the peace operation and an infl ux of international assistance, and the positive economic impact that it has in the short-term can thus not be sustained. Shin-wha Lee makes the point that hu- manitarian assistance in these contexts may also give a false sense of relief and distort the local economy, with possible negative unintended consequences. 16 Ammitzboell notes, for instance, how the provision of food assistance allow farmers the opportuni- ty to turn to cash crops, some of which may be undesirable not only from a food-security perspective, such as with poppy-growing in the Afghanistan context. Impact on local civil service Ammitzboell recorded the effects of the \u2018brain-drain\u2019 phenomenon and the \u2018dual public sector syndrome\u2019 on the host public sector, both of which contribute to a dys- functional and unreliable public sector. The perversity of this effect becomes even clearer when we take into consideration that it not only has a negative effect on the local econ- omy, but it is in fact directly opposite to the effect the peace operation intends to have on the local public sector, which in most man- dates are to build the capacity of the public sector and to support the extension of state control throughout the territory of the host state. Another example would be, as noted by Ammitzboell, the combination of weak local administrative capacity and the infl ow of considerable amounts of aid and/or direct budgetary assistance, resulting in an increase in corruption by state offi cials. Change in gender roles Another aspect of the impact that the in- ternational community tends to have on a host society is the way in which interna- tional assistance programmes empowers cer- tain types of individuals, for instance, those with Western language and cultural skills. Another category that has become popular over the last decade is women who tend to be the focus of various types of \u2018empow- erment\u2019 programmes by international aid organisations, and whom are often given preferential access to jobs, training and oth- er economic and career opportunities. The intended consequences of these programmes are to have a positive impact on develop- ment and stability by empowering women to play a more assertive role in their society. The medium- to long-term effects of these initiatives are the subject of various studies, but Koyama and Myrttinen have identifi ed some negative short-term consequences on women, for example, by inviting resentment against them within families and society in general for their newly gained economic independence and power, which in some cases may result in an increase in domestic violence. 17 They also point out that while such programmes may have a short-term and direct impact on the women involved, it takes longer for society to adapt and this may have further unintended consequences. If there is a sudden increase in the employ- ment of women it may impact on their tra- ditional roles at home, where women bear the disproportionate share of child-rearing and household work. It may, for instance, result in burden-shifting to younger chil- dren and the elderly. 15 K.

Aning and Sotomayor discuss cases of corruption such as the manipulation of appointments to peace operations (where selection implies signifi cant fi nancial gain for individual sol- diers and offi cers), and the misappropriation of funds received from the UN to reimburse countries for some of the costs of their par- ticipation in peace operations. Integrating unintended consequences into the planning and managing of peace operations Most of the research cited noted the impor- tance of institutionalising accountability in peace operations. In the past, the weakness or lack of clarity in accountability mecha- nisms in itself created a \u2018permissive\u2019 envi- ronment within which unintended negative side-effects went unreported and therefore fell outside the realm of that which should be managed. When they did occur at such a scale that they could not be ignored they were usually managed as exceptional phe- nomena that require a temporary, once-off, response. For example, Kent, Koyama and Myrttin- en\u2019s fi ndings indicate that peace operations have not meaningfully anticipated the real- ity of sexual exploitation and abuse before the late 1990s, and that it is only half-way through the fi rst decade of the 21st centu- ry that various steps to anticipate, prevent and manage sexual violence and abuse in UN peace operations have become institu- tionalised. Before these latest developments, peace operations rarely addressed enduring violence on women and girls, due to a lack of consciousness of the problem, the sever- ity of the implications of the problem for all concerned, and most importantly a lack of institutional preparedness to identify, contain and manage the problem. There are very few examples of UN peace operations identifying, containing and managing unintended con- sequences outside of the sexual exploitation and abuse realm. It is thus not yet a widely understood, discounted and institutionalised phenomenon. Planning In order to improve our ability to man- age complex peace operations, we need to improve our understanding of the dynam- ics of complex systems, including complex social systems. This article makes the point that unintended consequences are part of the natural feedback cycle of complex sys- tems and cannot be avoided. However, we can improve our ability to anticipate, miti- gate and discount specifi c potential negative unintended consequences, and in so doing, Koyama and Myrttinen\u2019s research into the Cambodian and Timorese cases touch on the direct link between the deployment of peacekeepers and the infl ux of aid workers, the growth of the local sex industry, and an increase in the number of cases of sexual exploitation and abuse. They also note the link between a declining sex industry and the departure, or signifi cant withdrawal, of a peace operation and the humanitarian aid community. The impact on troop contributing countries Peace operations give rise to a range of opportunities and costs for troop contribut- ing countries (TCCs), be they fi nancial, social or political, to which TCCs have responded in varying manners. Some of these oppor- tunities and costs gave rise to unintended effects, some signifi cant, some not as signifi - cant as is generally believed. For instance, there is a widely held perception that some developing countries contribute troops to UN peace operations because it is considered a \u2018fi nancial opportunity\u2019 by both military in- stitutions and individual troops. In Aning\u2019s study of Ghana, 18 fi nancial gains from par- ticipation in peace operations for both indi- viduals and the state seem substantial, while Sotomayor points to similar perceptions in Argentina and Uruguay. Murthy\u2019s chapter on India and Pakistan fi nds, however, that such gains did not constitute a signifi cant 18 K.

        "[ 173 ] improve the overall effectiveness of peace operations. This knowledge leads us to the under- standing that in a complex system unin- tended consequences should not come as a surprise. Once we realise and accept this fact, it follows that whenever we plan or under- take action in the complex peace operations context, we have to discount the potential unintended consequences of our actions. As the system is dynamic and we can therefore not predict all the ways in which it may respond to our actions, it means that we have to anticipate that despite our best planning efforts, we will still not be able to foresee all the potential unintended consequences our actions can have. However, through research of past actions and by systematically thinking through the consequences our actions are likely to evoke, we should be able to signifi cantly reduce some of the obvious negative consequences of the past. Anticipating the potential unin- tended consequences of our actions should thus become a standard aspect of our plan- ning procedures and processes. Real-time monitoring and evaluation If we accept that despite our planning ef- forts some unintended consequences will still occur, then we should introduce, as standard practice, monitoring systems that can iden- tify emerging unintended consequences, so that we can try to contain or counter their potential negative effects. In fact, peace op- erations should have monitoring systems in place to study whether the missions are hav- ing their desired effect on the system. If such systems are in place, an important sub-set of such systems should be the identifi cation of any unintended consequences, especially negatives ones that may be emerging in re- sponse to our actions. The alertness to po- tential negative unintended consequences should thus be integrated into an overall awareness of the dynamic nature of the com- plex systems that peace operations are try- ing to infl uence. Such awareness should in- form a willingness to continuously adapt the planning and management of peace opera- tions, and its various aspects, to the way the system is responding to the peace interven- tion. Real-time monitoring and longer-term evaluation are tools that will assist those responsible for managing peace operations to detect, at the earliest opportunity, when unintended consequences occur. The \u2018do no harm\u2019 approach One methodology for anticipating unin- tended consequences that has been devel- oped in the context of humanitarian assist- ance is the Do No Harm 20 approach. In short, this approach is built on the realisation that aid cannot be provided without becoming part of the wider confl ict, and provides a model for planning, continuously monitor- ing and adjusting the effects of any assist- ance programme by identifying and down- playing the negative infl uences while at the same time identifying and encouraging the positive infl uences of the programme. It thus implies (a) recognising that unintended con- sequences will occur, (b) putting systems in place that will identify the effect one\u2019s action is having (both positive and nega- tive), and (c) steering and refi ning that ef- fect by countering potential negative effects and encouraging and modulating the posi- tive unintended consequences towards the intended impact. It implies that one needs to understand that intervening in a com- plex system requires a continuous process of adjustment. Unintended consequences that cannot be avoided Through planning and monitoring efforts, like the Do No Harm approach or others, we are likely to identify unintended conse- quences that cannot be avoided if we want to continue to pursue a specifi c course of action. This implies that we may be faced with situations where we have to discount the potential negative consequences of our actions with the potential good that those same actions are intended to generate. This predicament is not unknown, and has been addressed before in the context of the Double Effect and Just War theories. We do not intend repeating these theo- ries here in detail, but the principle of dou- 20 M. B. Anderson (1999). Do no Harm: How aid can support peace or war . London: Lynne Rienner. ",
        "[ 174 ] political ideals formed by the need for com- promise and mutual assurance, rather than realistically achievable timeframes. Managing complex peace operations thus necessitates an ongoing planning process that constantly monitors and evaluates the feedback gener- ated by the system so that peace operation can continuously adjust its programmes or initiate new actions accordingly. The accountability debate The attempt to establish clear account- ability in peace operations is hampered by two factors. One of them concerns authority , the issue of to whom a peace op- eration is accountable. The second issue con- cerns the control of the mission. Hampson and Kihara-Hunt address ac- countability in the context of the responsi- bility to address criminal conduct or breach- es of applicable disciplinary codes. 22 This relates to the \u2018control\u2019 of the mission is- sue through the management of the behav- iour of individuals and it covers unintended consequences such as sexual exploitation and abuse, corruption, theft, etc. M\u00e9gret, on the other hand, addresses authority in the broader sense of unintended consequenc- es caused by the actions or omissions of the mission itself, 23 and it covers the kind of unintended consequences addressed by Ammitzboell (economic consequences), ble effect is a moral principle for assessing actions that produce side-effect harm that has wide-ranging utility. In short, it states that, although actors are responsible for the harmful side-effects that ensue from their actions, actions that produce harmful side- effects are nevertheless permissible provided that: (1) the primary goal of the action is legitimate; (2) the side-effects are not part of the actor\u2019s intended goal; (3) the side- effects are not a means to this goal; (4) the side-effects are permissible only if the actor aims to prevent or minimise them; and (5) no alternative courses of action could have been taken that would have led to fewer or no side-effects. 21 There are thus existing theories and ap- proaches that can assist us in developing practical means of containing and managing unintended consequences when they cannot be avoided altogether. However, we should always be cautious of overestimating our ability to \u2018manage\u2019 outcomes when deal- ing with complex systems. A further insight we need to gain from our study of complex systems is that managing the host system, in the sense of controlling it, is impossibly complex. Our defi nition of managing unin- tended consequences in the peace operations context is purposefully interacting with the system with the aim of continuously adjust- ing our actions to the feedback generated by the system with a view to minimising any negative unintended consequences our inter- ventions may have caused. When we talk of containing and managing unintended conse- quences the emphasis is thus on being alert to system feedback through institutionalised monitoring and evaluating mechanisms, and constantly adjusting our planning and op- erations accordingly. Planning for peace operations can thus not rely on a \u2018fi re-and-forget\u2019 planning model where a peace operation is planned prior to deployment, and then perhaps annually re- viewed against the original plan, or in some cases only after the situation has fundamen- tally changed to the extent that signifi cant- ly more troops are required. In the complex peace operations context each action result in the system responding in various ways that will require a range of further actions. The analogy most apt is that of steering a ship. Although the destination is known at the outset, and although it is possible to plan the journey in great detail, the actual voyage re- quires thousands of route adjustments, some minor some more signifi cant, to reach the destination. The reality of peace operations is, however, even more complex in that the destination is a very broadly defi ned desired end state and the exact journey is unclear beyond the milestones contained in peace agreements, and these are typically unrealistic 21 G.

For this latter category, the question of authority, or to whom a peace operation re- ports to, two models may be relevant, name- ly the delegation and participation models. 25 These models capture two separate poten- tial accountability mechanisms. In the del- egation model, power is exercised by those who are delegated with the authority to do so, making them accountable to those who delegate the power to them. In the participa- tory model, those in power are accountable to individuals in the polity. In the interna- tional sphere, different perceptions about accountability create tensions and confl icts. Whereas some perceive international or- ganisations \u2014 such as the UN, World Bank, etc. \u2014 as reporting to their member govern- ments (delegation model), others hold that these organisations\u2019 actions should be made accountable directly to the people who are affected by these organisations\u2019 actions (par- ticipation model). Thus in the UN peace operation context, some would argue that a peace operation is accountable to the UN Security Coun- cil, the body responsible for establishing and supervising the mission, while others would argue that a peace operations should be accountable to its host community, i.e. the people whom the peace operation are meant to assist. M\u00e9gret notes that there is a shift observable in various areas of govern- ance from a \u2018shareholder\u2019 view of account- ability to one emphasizing the importance of \u2018stakeholders\u2019. Ideally, a peace operation should establish a balance between these two models, for neither seems suffi cient ground for accountability by itself. Whereas the ac- countability of the peace operation to the UN Security Council, and indeed the UN General Assembly for budgetary matters, are estab- lished practice, mechanisms still need to be developed for meaningful host community participatory accountability. 26 One such mechanism was addressed by Hoffman, in the form of the ombudsperson model, which provides us with one example of a mechanisms that may empower the lo- cal population to submit claims against the peace operation. 27 However, much more can and should be done to develop meaningful accountability towards and by the host com- munity, not just in the context of legal ac- countability related to some form of wrong doing \u2014 for which a range of practical rec- ommendations has been made in the studies by Kent, Koyama and Myrttinen, Hampson and Kihara-Hunt, and M\u00e9gret \u2014 but also through ongoing and proactive political ac- countability. This can come about through a process of consultation and participation in order to, among others, seek advice and input from the host community on future plans and to receive and monitor feedback from the community on programmes being undertaken. 28 One obvious question is who constitutes the host community? And one can respond that the host community should be repre- sented through a range of institutions and mechanisms at all levels of society, and should include civil society. In a post-con- fl ict context, which is the condition in which most peace missions operate, most of the offi cial institutional positions and mecha- nisms will undergo considerable change un- der contested circumstances, and the peace operation would thus have to be resource- ful in ensuring that the mechanisms it is 24 S.

Conclusion We were struck by the absence of liter- ature on, or even remotely related to, the phenomenon of unintended consequences. Most of the references that were available are anecdotal. Our recommendation is thus to encourage further research into the unin- tended consequences of peacekeeping. However, even within the scope of the limited research undertaken into this topic, and to which our study is a modest contri- bution, it has become clear that unintended consequences is an important, yet neglected subject. It is an important subject because some of the unintended consequences that come about in the context of peace opera- tions are morally and ethically unaccept- able, while others can seriously hamper a mission\u2019s capacity to achieve its mandate. In fact, we have seen that some unintend- ed consequences can question the value of peace operations itself, while others have brought sending institutions, like the United Nations, into disrepute and have been ma- interacts with, or facilitates, reflect the broadest possible representation of popular will and opinion. 29 As M\u00e9gret points out, the challenge is no longer to determine wheth- er the UN should be accountable, the chal- lenge is now to determine what accountabil- ity means by examining the various options for accountability. Who has control over the mission? The other issue that hampers the establish- ment of clear accountability in international peace operations concerns the control of the mission, i.e. those who are responsible for the peace operation do not necessarily have effective control over the responsibility to address criminal conduct or breaches of ap- plicable disciplinary codes of all the individ- uals that are perceived to be its employees. 30 The most obvious case in this context is the fact that personnel that are deployed as part of a military contingent to UN peace opera- tions remain under the legal authority of the sending state when it comes to criminal and disciplinary issues. Although the conduct of these personnel are also governed by inter- national humanitarian law, international human rights and other bodies of interna- tional law, these instruments need to be ap- plied through the national legal systems of the troop contributing country. Hampson and Kihara-Hunt also discuss the full spec- trum of other categories of UN peace opera- jor drivers for reform and calls for greater accountability within these international organisations. Those responsible for the planning, man- aging and supervision of peace operations need to recognise that unintended conse- quences are a natural consequence of the complex dynamic nature of complex sys- tems. As such, all peace operations should develop the capacity to identify, contain and manage unintended consequences. This im- plies that the United Nations and other in- stitutions that undertake peace operations need to develop institutional mechanisms for addressing unintended consequences, and should institutionalise planning, real-time monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that will enable it to anticipate and respond to emerging unintended consequences. The overriding message of this article is that we can no longer pretend that these side effects do not occur, or that when they do, that they are exceptional phenomena. An awareness of and sensitivity to unintended consequences should be integrated into the routine management processes of UN and other peace operations, so that they can be proactively prevented, contained or man- aged as part of the normal day-to-day real- ity of complex peace operations. 29 See the report of the \u2018Building Effective Partnerships Conference: Improving the Relationship between Internal and External Actors in Post-Confl ict Countries\u2019, 7 October 2004 available at www.ipa.org 30 Issues concerning the control of power in international relations are discussed in Grant and Keohane, op. cit., footnote 24, pp. 37-8.

If my photographs, taken in these pathetic theatres, fail to disturb and anger viewers where I myself have been so disturbed and angered, the work is of no merit. My search for the image is always free of thematic or storyline constraints. Arriving in a place with a fi xed idea of what you expect to see and photograph is a recipe for disaster. What do you do when, no matter what you try to isolate within your viewfi nder, the reality outside is ten times more shocking and threatens to swallow you up as you pick your way through it.

        "[ 193 ] Women and girls who challenge traditional gender roles by becoming combatants face stigmatisation upon their return home. Female ex-combatants are seen as violent, disobedi- ent and promiscuous. This is especially true for girl ex-soldiers who return home pregnant or with children. Stigmatisation means many girls are reluctant to identify themselves as former combatants. In Sierra Leone children who could prove they knew how to dismantle and fi re a gun were eligible for a DDR package, i.e., a school uniform and payment of school fees for three years, or a vocational training course. Girls were put off by this military orientation, which also excluded girls who worked as cooks or porters. In other DDR programmes, where money or food was given to soldiers in return for weapons, male soldiers stole guns from girls, or commanders confi scated the money girls received for their weapons. The lack of gender awareness in planning demobilisation camps also led to an increase in sexual vio- lence: in some camps girls were raped when they were housed next to men from enemy units. It is essential for gender assumptions to be re-examined if the needs of girl ex-combatants are to meet. The invisibility of women and girls in confl ict must be broken. The voices of wom- en and girl combatants must be heard. Only then will sustainable peace be possible. Girls become combatants for different rea- sons. Some are abducted or kidnapped. Oth- ers join voluntarily in order to confront social injustice or to achieve national goals. Some armed groups, such as the New Peoples Army (the Philippines), LTTE (Sri Lanka) and former Maoist guerrillas in Nepal, specifi cally em- phasize gender equality in their recruiting efforts. Researcher Yvonne E. Keairns identifi ed poverty as a key factor in girls joining, or be- ing abducted by, armed movements. Her re- search is based on interviews with girl soldiers from Angola, Colombia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. With little or no food at home, girls joined armed movements in order to empower themselves and their communities, or because they did not want to accept an arranged mar- riage or be hired out as a domestic servant. Many girls interviewed were escaping sexual abuse or other violence at home. Disarmament, demobilisation and reinte- gration (DDR) programs fail girl soldiers. The Save the Children report Forgotten Casual- ties of Wars revealed that in the Democratic Republic of Congo, only 2 percent of those going through Save the Children\u2019s demobili- sation programs were girls, despite the estimat- ed 12,500 girl soldiers there. In Sierra Leone, the percentage of girls in such programs is 4.2 per cent. The only option for many girl ex- combatants is prostitution. Women in confl ict situations Women and girls perform many roles in confl ict, such as hostages, spies, porters, cooks, nurses and propaganda symbols. They secure food and fi rewood and provide sexual services. One role has remained largely invisible \u2014 that of combatant. Women form over 10 per cent of regular armed forces in Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand and the United States. The number of women and girls in irregu- lar, or guerrilla, armed forces is even higher. One-quarter of El Salvador\u2019s Farabundo Mar- t\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) and 30 per cent of Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinista National Liberation Front were women and girls. To- day, women and girls comprise one-third of Sri Lanka\u2019s Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the same percentage in several of Colombia\u2019s armed opposition groups. Girl combatants have been particularly ig- nored. Girls, defi ned by international conven- tions as females under 18 years of age, are approximately 40 per cent of today\u2019s 300,000 child soldiers. The groundbreaking study Where are the Girls? Girls in Fighting Forces in Northern Uganda, Sierra Leone and Mo- zambique: Their Lives During and After War by researchers Susan McKay and Dyan Maz- urana, discovered that between 1990 to 2003, girls were part of fi ghting forces in 55 coun- tries and took part in armed confl icts in 38 of these countries.

Critical and constructive debates on adjustments to prevent problems from escalating into a violent confl ict require independent, profes- sional media as well as a well-functioning civil society. In the former Yugoslavia it was possible to discuss almost everything in the media, but impossible until the immediate pre-con- fl ict phase to criticise and debate the rul- ing Communist Party or the fundamental construction of the Yugoslav federal state, characterised by a multitude of national groups. In other confl ict countries it has been very diffi cult to question unfair eth- nic and economic divisions, geographical claims on sovereignty and natural resources, or other issues, which may eventually cause an escalation of the confl ict. Rather than merely serving as the gov- ernment\u2019s mouthpiece, the media must be allowed to discuss any issues of relevance to the local community in an early pre-con- fl ict phase, thus opening a new role for the media as a catalyst of social change. It is also essential to ensure that a common me- dia platform is accessible to all population groups to maintain national identity and coherence. The goals and means used by international actors in the early pre-confl ict phase are identical whether the objective is confl ict prevention, democracy, fundamental ropean Commission. As is often the case, the challenge is to develop and implement coor- dinated, comprehensive strategies based on these instruments. This is defi nitely neces- sary in the fi eld of media, which constitutes a relevant tool in all phases of a confl ict, be the objective democracy, human rights and social development, or be it peacebuilding and prevention of confl icts. Due to the prom- inent role of the media in achieving these objectives, strategies connecting short-term rapid actions with medium- and long-term measures are essential. This implies tools and mechanisms ensuring the capacity to react rapidly and comprehensively in situations of urgency, crisis or emerging crises. Media and structural confl ict prevention When working with local media in confl ict areas a delicate balance must be maintained between our immediate goals \u2014 confl ict pre- vention, democracy, fundamental freedoms and peacebuilding. Most confl icts are rooted in structural inadequacies, but triggered by dynamic causes often featuring the political leadership of the confl icting parties as partic- ipants. The distinction between structural and dynamic factors is very useful when looking at the scope and goals for media assistance. The prevention of confl icts \u2014 recurring or not \u2014 requires a public sphere with open discussion of social inadequacies where po- S TREAMLINING OF MEDIA AS A CFSP INSTRUMENT Bent N\u00f8rby Bonde is a manager, academic and consultant working with the constructive use of media in confl ict prevention, peacebuilding and democracy development in the Balkans, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. He was co- founder and executive manager for the Baltic Media Centre Fond, working with a staff of 70 in 23 countries, promoting peace and democracy. He was co-founder and member of the board of the European Coordination of Film Festivals, and the Bonn Network. He has a PhD in Communication and Confl ict and is a member of the Danish Foreign Policy Society and of the European Communication Research and Education Association. Introduction It is evident that media has played a sig- nifi cant role in escalating confl icts. This is true for almost all violent confl icts \u2014 Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Gujarat, Iraq, Kosovo/a and many more. Media is also employed to radicalise young people into terrorists. Nevertheless, media may also be used to contribute to the prevention of confl icts and the building of peace. Even in confl ict man- agement during a crisis, media and commu- nication strategies are essential. To be suc- cessful in its civilian response to confl icts, in its ambitions to spread democracy and fundamental rights and in its ambitions to support social development and regional cooperation in third countries, the European Union has to make use of media as a cata- lyst for change. The EU\u2019s Common Foreign and Security Policy provides the European Commission with all necessary instruments to deal with civilian prevention of confl icts and to sup- port peacebuilding, including working with the media. Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) along with programmes for human rights and de- mocracy (EIDHR), development cooperation (DCI), neighbouring countries (ENPI) and the Instrument for Stability (IfS) ensuring rapid response in urgent crises and medium-term support under more stable conditions are among the instruments available to the Eu- ",

After the ending of a war where the me- dia has been a means in the escalation of confl ict, many international donors have often assumed a need to liberalise the me- dia sector as much as possible, particularly the mechanisms for issuing licenses to new broadcasters. What seems a logical reaction to biased media escalating a confl ict may involuntarily sow the seeds for the next confl ict as in the former Yugoslav republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina, where 400 broadcast- ers started up in a war-torn country with a non-existing market. Media without fi - nancial resources, almost no professional journalists and hardly any ethical stand- ards tend to associate with political fac- tions which may harm rather than facili- tate peacebuilding. An international focus on freedom of speech standards is seldom enough to establish peace in an immediate post-confl ict situation or prevent an out- break of violence in a pre-confl ict context, while in a stable democracy it might be one of the most important prerequisites for sus- tainable peace. Again timing, priorities and a balanced approach are necessary. Thus, strategies to promote democracy and human rights must necessarily be coor- dinated with strategies to prevent confl icts or build peace. Consequently, the EU must consider these strategies as interdependent and integrated elements in other develop- ment activities. lation is usually considered an important step forward in a democratic development. In the phases right before and after a peak- ing confl ict, there is no guarantee that a quick liberalisation of media laws helps pre- vent the confl ict or that a mushrooming of independent media will stabilise peace. Again, the Yugoslav example is illustra- tive. Less than two years before the inter- nal wars, new media legislation was passed after heavy internal and international pres- sure. Private, commercial media were al- lowed and the state media were required to adhere to international public service standards, including independent and im- partial reporting. It is common knowledge that the state media in Yugoslavia acted as a mouthpiece for the political leadership in each republic, supporting violent confl icts with each other. With the political escalation of confl icts the new legislation was never implement- ed and the state media ended up as useful propaganda tools. Most of the experienced, professional journalists were dismissed, sent on leave or removed from the screens and loudspeakers. Young, inexperienced staff without journalist educations replaced them, and eventually only patriotic or na- tionalistic journalists and editors were in control. The Yugoslav example is far from alone in demonstrating the importance of international focus in the confl ict escala- tion phase on the practical protection of the safety, rights and independence of journal- ists and media rather than concentrate on freedoms or sustainable peace and confl ict transformation. Dilemmas of media in structural confl ict prevention When international actors enter a con- fl ict area during confl ict escalation or in the phase immediately before the outbreak of violence, the situation is much more complicated. One of the dilemmas faced after the con- fl ict has escalated is that the very legitimate foreign policy goals of supporting a tran- sition to democracy and promoting funda- mental freedoms may easily threaten the peace. Research demonstrates that totali- tarian systems in transition to democracy and fl edgling democracies are vulnerable to confl icts. When Yugoslavia introduced multiparty elections at the federal level, nationalists were elected leaders in four of fi ve republics. One year later the country was engaged in several severe wars. Simi- larly, the genocide in Rwanda took place shortly after the fi rst democratic multiparty elections. The confl ict vulnerability of countries in transition does not make the goal of democ- racy irrelevant, but it indicates the necessity to time and prioritise realistic goals to pre- vent a country from the gradual escalation of violent confl icts. Similarly, a free and diverse media land- scape accessible to all groups of the popu- ",

If a journalist in one situation pursues one goal as peace, however important it is, she might be seen to pursue other interests in the political life of a democracy. At its best, media content may help set the agen- da for discussions among the recipients. In a short-term perspective international ac- tors must respect that editorial freedom and autonomous control over editorial content remains with publishers, broadcasters, edi- tors and journalists of the local media we support, while increasing their capacity to make professional, impartial and responsible editorial judgements. Particularly in news and fact-based jour- nalism, international actors must maintain a careful balance, respecting the integrity of the local journalists, while helping to develop their professionalism. Less contro- versial than news programmes are fi ction se- ries, sports and entertainment, which may be highly effi cient to set the agenda for popular discussions and contribute to re-establish- ing relations, re-conciliating populations or increasing awareness about the causes of confl ict. In the charts next page different genres and content are related to the phases of confl ict mentioned above and the aims of international confl ict prevention or peacebuilding. propagating prejudice, stereotypes and even hatred against the \u2018others\u2019. Some media even actively encourage popular participation in killings and fi ghts, making it virtually im- possible for the population to rely on any media as neutral. In this phase international media interventions should support cross- confl ict, self-regulatory means to prevent media from broadcasting and distributing confl ict-escalating journalism. This phase also calls on international actors to make confl ict-escalating media aware of the risk of being held accountable to the Interna- tional Criminal Court. Alternatively, the in- terventions must be in the form of reliable, trustworthy sources beyond the control of the top leaders. In this case international organisations, donors and implementers need to consider their media policy carefully. If international donors in crisis situations produce content with unsupported messages or convey par- ticular policies they will fail. This is part- ly because communication research today shows that the recipients do not uncritically accept and appropriate such messages, and particularly not if their own reality is dif- ferent from the conveyed messages. And it is partly because constructed messages or positive \u2018propaganda\u2019 for peace hampers the credibility of the local media and makes it diffi cult for the local population to believe Working with media to change confl ict dynamics Timing and approach is even more criti- cal when it comes to actions playing directly into the dynamics of a confl ict dealing with content, advocacy and policy. Numerous violent confl icts demonstrate that most media become biased in their reporting and fuel prejudice against their adversaries once the confl ict begins to es- calate. In this phase the top leadership of governments, opposition parties, independ- ence movements or threatened minorities attempts to control the media. The media institutions become the scene for internal fi ghts between professional management and journalism on one side and staff sub- mitting to political pressure on the other. In this phase the goal for international media interventions must be to support genuine media ideals like impartiality, diversity and objectivity. Often this can be achieved by combining capacity building, advocacy and increased involvement of local media repre- sentatives in international cooperation. In the immediate pre-confl ict phase all signifi cant media are under control or have been harassed and closed down. The space for questioning the top leadership in its fuel- ling of the confl ict is minimal or non-ex- istent. Media contributes to moral panic by ",

This step is supported from the Bolivian government and willing partners from the European public service broadcasters and the NGO community. Lebanon is another example, where media could help prevent internal vio- lent confl icts and confl icts between Israel and Hezbollah. The stakes are high for the involved politicians and the media is an important tool. Inter-cultural dialogue is virtually non-existent so it is crucial and urgent to establish a mutual, neutral, di- verse and moderate platform for dialogue and debate to keep peace and promote unity in the country. The political leaders from all factions seem most focused on their own private media, which has made it diffi cult for the public broadcaster, T\u00e9l\u00e9 Li- ban, to refl ect the diversity of all the popu- lar groups and strengthen national coher- ence. Nevertheless, the public broadcaster would be an obvious platform for running a project focusing on programmes with di- alogue and debates among the population groups, and independent and diverse news programmes. To succeed, such a project should be managed by all confl icting par- ties in the country and probably be fa- cilitated through ASBU, EBU and relevant representatives from the NGO community working with media in confl ict. Another example where EU interven- tion could be useful is in dealing with the Bolivian media to prevent violent confl icts, as land reforms, nationalisation of the hy- drocarbon sector, and the election of a con- stituent Assembly to agree on a new consti- tution has drawn protests from the dominant city-based broadcasters, representing pri- marily the middle and upper classes. As a contrast to the very critical private media a new public radio network covering also the rural part of the country may ultimately prove to develop into a mouthpiece for the government defending the government\u2019s re- forms rather than becoming the balanced and much needed public service broadcaster providing access for the marginalised, poor parts of the population. The division between the government and opposition is now repro- duced in the media structure, which makes it urgent to encourage private and public me- dia to act professionally, to be balanced and impartial, refl ecting all parts of the popula- tion. The EU could prevent an escalation of confl ict by facilitating an interim Forum for Dialogue involving private and public media, journalists, politicians and regulatory bodies to agree on guidelines such as: (cid:129) codes of ethics and systems for media self- regulation; (cid:129) public service broadcasting \u2014 programme standards and goals; (cid:129) private media \u2014 roles, programme stand- ards and markets; (cid:129) community media \u2014 social role, pro- gramme standards and funding; A coherent EU-strategy employing all instruments in coordinated efforts to pre- vent confl icts, build peace and secure fun- damental rights across the world is in high demand. But media also plays an impor- tant role in preventing long-term threats by helping to avoid radicalisation and the recruitment of youngsters to Islamist- based terrorism. In the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) in Pakistan the sense of isolation and negligence from the national authorities combined with very active religious lead- ers in the villages of the FATA, bordering Afghanistan, has fuelled increased radi- calisation of the local population, and par- ticularly youth. The strong basis for bit- terness and hostility towards the national authorities and rest of the world can only be removed if the isolation is breached and the empowerment of the local popu- lation is increased. The only broadcaster transmitting in the area is Pakistan ra- dio, which has very little credibility with the local population. A neutral network of community radios providing independ- ent public service programming including important news and social reporting could help in creating a common public sphere within the FATA, give the local popula- tion a voice in the Pakistani community and strengthen their sense of inclusion in the national and international communi- ties. It would be very important to include also neutral reports about events in rest of Pakistan and the region. ",

It would be logical for the EU to make a dedicated media taskforce ensuring inter- nal coordination at all levels including the capacity to react rapidly. It would how- ever be more effi cient to enter a genuine partnership with the Bonn Network and make use of the strategic, technical and human capacity of the member organisa- tions, which are all actively working with media in confl icts. The Bonn Network has more than 25 member organisations worldwide \u2014 among them the Council of the European Union, OSCE, UNDP-BCPR, EBU, numerous media development organisations, researchers and the international media. By partnering with the Bonn Network, the EU would take an important step towards a global collabora- tion and coordination of media strategies with governmental, non-governmental and intergovernmental actors working actively with media in peacebuilding and confl ict prevention. Together with other measures such as di- plomacy, mediation, civil society collabo- ration, travel, trade, disarmament and non- proliferation, media can make an important difference to peacebuilding and confl ict prevention. Steps to be taken For EU there are plenty of challenges in making media an integrated and effi cient tool in its efforts to prevent confl icts, build peace, democracy and development. The Common Foreign and Security Policy still needs to streamline the use of media. It is crucial to ensure coherence within short-, mid- and long-term strategies. The impact from rapid short-term measures must not be counterproductive, but rather support long-term goals of confl ict transformation, democracy and development. Therefore, it is important that the thematic media strategies are coordinated. It is also essential that the coordination between the EC delegations, the geographical units and the important instruments such as IfS and EIDHR is pro- active and action-oriented.

Video is not as big as radio, but it supports and complements the radio aspect. In our context it is targeted at policy-makers, who are mostly based in Freetown. We know that a lot of policy-makers listen to the radio, but when you really want them to act they have to see something visual. This is what we have learned. Politicians and even the Ministry of Edu- cation will get behind a policy statement What are SFCG Sierra Leone current priorities? We are coming to the end of a two-year strategy in which current areas of focus are corruption, governance, education and youth/women. We have fi eld offi cers work- ing around these thematic areas; they let us know what people are thinking about these issues. Our fi eld offi cers know what issues are on people\u2019s minds because they are based there. And wherever you are, the issues are mostly the same throughout the country. Field offi cers bring in information from all directions, examine what people are saying, produce a programme about it and send it back to radio stations for airing. You end up hearing voices from all parts of the country from the person who is re- ally a stakeholder. We\u2019re trying to build a sense of nation- hood! Through the radio we are learning and sharing. We want people to know and to feel that their issues are being taken on board and that people are responding to them. It\u2019s not about radio news; it\u2019s about a sustained campaign around specifi c is- sues. As an organisation, we move with the context and the context determines how the programming goes. What is the mission of Search for Common Ground (SFCG), both generally and in Sierra Leone particularly? How is the organisa- tion\u2019s programme shaped? Search for Common Ground is an inter- national NGO with an ambitious mission: to change the way the world deals with con- fl ict. This is what most of the organisation\u2019s 16 fi eld offi ces around the world contribute towards. Each country programme is based on its own context, and when the country context changes so does the programme. There are a lot of tools we use in SFCG, and in Sierra Leone specifi cally we are using me- dia as well as outreach work. SFCG approaches confl ict transformation through the media, and in Sierra Leone radio is the best way to reach people. More than 80 per cent of people there tune into the radio. SFCG established the Talking Drum Studios, which are multi-media studios producing issue-based programming. This is in part- nership with 24 radio stations across Sierra Leone. We aim not only to add value to pro- gramming, we also try to impact the edito- rial and media landscapes in the country. Several other radio stations are copying our model, which is a good thing. This is what the whole mission is about: to change the way the world deals with confl ict!

In your presentation at the conference you spoke about the priority areas for SFCG, one of which is gender equality. Could you talk more about the situation of women in Sierra Leone and if gender equality is diffi cult to implement as a priority? The gender issue is a cultural and societal issue. Gender equality is something that we really struggle with. We have a specifi c pro- gramme for women focusing on the post- confl ict challenges women face; for exam- ple, inheritance property rights, abuse and a variety of discriminatory practices. We want women to be at the forefront and raise their voices. Community radio is a strong tool for women to be part and parcel to do just this: the more women\u2019s voices you have the better to be able to get women\u2019s issues on board. One of the challenges we\u2019re taking on is to see how we can get more women into the radio so they can start mobilising other women. If we can do this, it\u2019s a fi rst step to getting women to speak out. Women often do not think it\u2019s safe to be on the radio \u2014 many times they are called names or per- ceived to be prostitutes. They think that they make mistakes or that they\u2019re not articulate enough. It\u2019s a struggle, but it\u2019s also an in- vestment. We won\u2019t see the results in two or three years, but in ten years you\u2019ll really see a change. These are the seeds we\u2019re trying to sow now. 5 months or so, people start comparing and saying, \u2018last week you were talking about 1 million spent on communications and now you\u2019re talking about 10 million. Why?\u2019 People begin to question things, and this is very good. The citizens need to know how their money is being used. In one of the vid- eos shot for the local councils, a local market woman sat down and said, \u2018I heard yester- day that they spent 2 million on entertain- ment for the month. What is this? What does entertainment money mean?\u2019 The working woman wants to know more! She wants to know where her money is going. If people know how their money is being used they feel OK to pay their taxes. Following up on issues of transparency, the Sierra Leonean media was heavily affected during the war. What\u2019s the state of media now? How free is it? Search for Common Ground started opera- tions in Freetown in 2000, and at that time there were just four or fi ve radio stations. Now we have about 40. The landscape has expanded, and it\u2019s continuing to expand. There are community radio stations all over the country. Every district except one has a community radio. There is religious, pri- vate and government radio, too. All of those voices are out there, and it\u2019s quite developed right now. Radio is far better than print, which is very much Freetown-centred. The media land- scape has grown so much in the last six years that even the government cannot understand how to respond because they are still in the such as \u2018free basic education for all by 2015\u2019. Then you get out a video camera and go to rural schools where children are sitting on rocks and have no benches, no chalkboards and no books. We capture this and then go into a city where the children are dressed up nicely and have current textbooks. We show the contrast. We reproduce our videos and give them to institutions like OXFAM, CARE International and others working on governance issues. They use these videos to generate discussions about what is happening, particularly on the political scene. Are politicians receptive to this kind of me- dium and willing to be held accountable? Sometimes. We are not just generating ac- countability and pressure from our side; we are allowing people on all sides to have a say. For example, councils in Sierra Leone run in four-year terms. After two years we check on them and what they have done. People talk! They talk about what they know and what they have seen. We want to generate discus- sions about accountability, and we need to be because of widespread corruption. For example, there is a local programme we do called \u2018Accountability Now\u2019, which is mostly about the local councils. These coun- cils are supposed to post their income ex- penditure statements every month. A lot of people are not used to reading, and literacy rates are not so high in rural communities. So we take microphones to the notice board and read what is there \u2014 the income and expendi- ture \u2014 just so people know. After a period of ",
        "[ 203 ] in sight. Let us see what happens. A lot of people are looking at what the politicians are actually trying to do. For me person- ally, it\u2019s not too impressive as of yet. We need to do a lot of social accountability programming right now, to hold them re- sponsible for what they said. For example, during the election period SFCG organised in local communities debates between dif- ferent parliamentary candidates. There was a big forum outside the town hall, which was hooked up to the radio and people could ask [the candidates] questions. This was the fi rst time this happened, and we did it in nearly all constituencies. There was a huge demand on us to do more and more so that people could hear what the candidates had to say! We recorded all of these events, and we\u2019re going to go back and check after a year and ask, \u2018this is what you said; now, what have you done?\u2019 We want to push them to deliver on what they said before. We also did a \u2018situation committee\u2019 video about women and youth and their participa- tion in elections. It was very powerful. This was also the fi rst time for us to do video around this. For example, we would go to a women\u2019s hairdressing salon and hosted a debate there. The discussion that takes place is incredible! They talked about the real is- sues that people face. All of the different fronts we worked on about elections focused on stabilisation. Af- ter all, if you are not able to stabilise the situation you will defi nitely slide back into confl ict. Search for Common Ground pro- by civil society, which complemented inter- national bodies like the EU and the AU. Another contribution we made was through the Independent Radio Network (IRN), which has been an investment for SFCG over the past four years. The Independent Radio Net- work is a coalition of about 20 radio sta- tions. The network brings in what we call a \u2018Common Ground approach\u2019 to the me- dia landscape. During elections the Network broadcasted simultaneously across the coun- try. We worked with the national electoral commission, for example, giving them free airtime on a weekly basis. We also gave poli- ticians equal space, which really supported the electoral process. During the election we had some 400 re- porters covering the country who called in and explained the situation on the ground. We put them on the air from the most remote places in the country. This was also a prob- lem-solving mechanism for the police \u2014 they could know where to react, and fast. When the election results came in \u2014 which took quite a while because we don\u2019t yet have computerised mechanisms to tally votes and roads are bad \u2014 our reporters were calling to tell us what that polling station got. This really decreased the tension, and by the time the offi cial results came in it was no longer a huge issue. People knew what was happen- ing and felt it to be transparent. What\u2019s the climate like post-elections? Are people more inclined to trust their leaders? You can\u2019t really say the climate is optimis- tic yet, but there is a new wave of politicians This is already going on in the bigger towns because there you have a lot more women who can challenge issues. It will take some time for us to get the momentum go- ing in the rural areas. Gender discrimina- tion is really rife. Even when the president was making a big fuss about bringing in more women he was just talking about three or four women ministers. Come on \u2014 in a 40-member cabinet! They talk about \u2018not enough qualifi ed women\u2019, but it\u2019s obviously not about this. There is another problem as well: a lot of \u2018elite\u2019 women do not like to go into politics, they prefer the advocacy side of things. So instead they are engaged in civil society. Regarding the political front, Sierra Leone had successful presidential elections ear- lier this year. How was Search for Common Ground engaged? We contributed signifi cantly and were commended for our role. SFCG worked on a few major fronts, one of which was the Na- tional Elections Watch, a coalition of civil society groups monitoring the democratic process. Search for Common Ground is the chair of the National Elections Watch and we house the secretariat in our offi ce. We organised more than 6,000 electoral observers; there was at least one observer at each polling station. This was the fi rst time in history of mobilising civil society in such a way. It wasn\u2019t just about monitoring; it was about the entire process such as voter registration and voter education. This was a huge effort ",
        "[ 204 ] on we can use these drama groups. They have become increasingly successful because they know how to tailor messages. People are seeing more and more how effective this is. Like you said, the TRC report came out nearly two years ago and its recommenda- tions are still not being implemented. Do you think it\u2019s because they are not realistic? Or is it a general lack of support? It is a general lack of support and will of the government. This was really where the government lost its credibility, and so they were voted out. These recommendations need to be carried out because they lead to the war. The recommendations say \u2018if we do this we won\u2019t go back to confl ict\u2019. If the gov- ernment isn\u2019t willing to move forward then it is a problem and people get frustrated. You have all of these amputees and repara- tion issues \u2014 people are frustrated and they showed in their voting! They vented their views about it. During your presentation at the conference you spoke about a possible regional Disar- mament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) strategy. Can you speak more about what such a scheme might look like? When war breaks out in a particular region or country, remember that a lot of people are criss-crossing as refugees and displaced people. Idle youth are often targeted by those on the other side saying \u2018hey, come over here and help us fi ght\u2019. And they give them mon- ey to do so. Even when a war is fi nishing a lot of these people return home and they go ing on the outreach side of things. The media complements our outreach work \u2014 alliance building, coalition building and network- ing. Some issues throughout the country are very sensitive and if as an organisation or an individual you try to take these on, you are simply not going to be able. Society is closely knit. Since groups eve- rywhere basically have the same issues, we bring them together to discuss. SFCG pro- vides a space for alliances on all kinds of issues, and we hook them up to the radio, too. Search for Common Ground has sev- eral kinds of alliances and coalitions, like for example motorcycle taxi drivers. These are mostly ex-combatants who were part of the war, and now the police chase them because they have no licence, no helmets or don\u2019t follow traffi c laws. There were violent clashes between them and the police all the time. We organised a coalition called the \u2018Transport Stakeholder Taskforce\u2019. We invited everyone to come around the table and talk about the issues. When we dug a little deeper we discovered that even the government of- fi cials were not talking to one another, and the taxi drivers were just stuck in the mid- dle. We started having regular forums, and the situation started to calm down. This is a very practical thing we provide as an out- reach arm of our work. SFCG also does trainings for local drama groups, most of which are based in Free- town. We are trying to develop community resources so we train a small drama group around message design, and it\u2019s a ready re- source. Any time we have a message to pass vides information that helps people to make informed decisions and informed choices. You mention \u2018sliding back into confl ict\u2019. In your opinion, what are the chances of that? How dangerous is a short institutional memory? It\u2019s dangerous; you can\u2019t just leave. During my presentation at this conference I men- tioned a couple things I think that post- confl ict you have to pay attention to in the Sierra Leonean case \u2014 like the Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) report, for example. Its recommendations have been on the table for a few years and yet no one has made any profound movement around them. The TRC report is the history of the war and its rec- ommendations are on the table so we don\u2019t slip back into confl ict. Equally important is the Human Rights Commission. The independent media also needs at- tention because the landscape is expand- ing. People\u2019s independent voices need to be heard and Sierra Leoneans need to feel that it is truly independent! During the elections a few people questioned if we were doing propaganda. But at the same time, the level of trust is generally very high. When the Independent Radio Network was broadcast- ing, everybody was tuned in. We need to hold on to that space because if we don\u2019t bad things can happen. The political parties had their own radio stations, and you can imagine the propaganda and terrible things they were doing.

What are your thoughts about the recent Hollywood fi lm \u2018Blood Diamond\u2019 and about all of the international media attention about Sierra Leone? I saw the fi lm, but I didn\u2019t pay much at- tention to it. I think we\u2019ve passed that stage. People say, \u2018Aw, I saw Blood Diamond and I know Sierra Leone\u2019. But the country is at a different level now. The movie was really old stuff, and this should not be the perception. It\u2019s exactly what we are trying to get away from. We should be talking about what\u2019s go- ing on in the country now. There are huge issues about decentralisation and disarma- ment. The government is moving forward and there has been security sector reform. Also, the media landscape is open and we had successful elections. These are the is- sues going on, and this is what we need to be talking about. The international media jumped on Blood Diamond , but it\u2019s just not the right picture now. nected to war. The war in Sierra Leone was around resources and the centralisation of resources. You had one group who for 24 years marginalised an entire other group of people and centralised everything in the cap- ital city. People in the border areas of the country turned to their neighbouring border for help. When the uprising started people said \u2018we are tired of being ignored and we need to be part of our society\u2019. It was nothing religious, tribal or ethnic \u2014 it was about resources and the class system. A lot of young people felt marginalised and the few people who were benefi ting from the system were targeted: rich people, chiefs and government offi cials, even if they weren\u2019t corrupt. This is why the war was so hard to deal with because there was no ethnic or tribal element to it. When the war was fi nally over, a pro- gramme of decentralisation was put in place whereby people have more real power. It aimed to bring development to the doorstep of the people. The next elections are in 2008, and it\u2019s only after four years that people re- back with their two or three guns. They will bury one and wait for the next good deal because they know there will be a violent uprising in future. Thus far the implementation of the DDR has been really country specifi c. It basically just looks at a single country and how to take away the guns. You do this in one country, but the implementation strategy is different in the next country. In West Africa people are just hanging around with their guns waiting to go to, for example, to Guinea. Why don\u2019t we have a well thought out regional strategy that encompasses all of these young people? Let\u2019s have a strategy that accommodates a large number of people and not just moves guns from one place to another. This is what is happening. After such a brutal civil war do you think Sierra Leoneans are really ready for peace? Is there still a sense of retribution? People are ready for peace; they don\u2019t want to go into war again. Nobody wants to hear about guns, about coups or anything con- ",

        "[ 207 ] for the earthquake only US $8 million have been collected so far. The US\u2019 contribution to tsunami relief work was US $350 million and this wasn\u2019t even the largest contribution which came from Australia and amounted to US $819.9 million. In the TV and print media moni- tored in the US there were 804 reports on the tsunami and 210 on the earthquake. Hu- manitarian organisations received US $13.2 million from the private sector. Governmen- tal support did not vary as much as public support, as governmental offi ces have more direct information and connection to reality than the audience and public at large whose perceptions and issue stances are shaped by media coverage. Media Tenor has been researching these connections for the past several years and this study supports the \u2018Theory of Agenda Setting and Cutting'. Both disasters resulted in an out-pour- ing of global donations and fund drives. The magnitude of both disasters was differ- ent in terms of the death toll and economic devastation, and this could be a factor as to why the tsunami received far more cover- age which in turn affected private donations. The tsunami affected tourist areas which could also explain why there was more re- porting and global solidarity. In either case, the volume of coverage was very low given the fact that hundreds of thousands of lives were lost. If this reporting trend continues, it will lead to lower international awareness and consequently an avoidably high death toll from lack of aid and relief efforts. It is evident from the analysis that cover- age differs a lot in all the analyzed coun- tries. For example, in Germany, the tsunami received 666 reports in the three TV chan- nels in comparison to 66 on the earthquake. Those 666 reports resulted in private dona- tions amounting to US $178 million while Discrepancy in coverage between the tsunami (December 2004) and the earthquake (October 2005) There was a perceptible difference between the coverage on the tsunami that hit South- East Asia in December 2004 and the earth- quake that hit Pakistan in October 2005. The tsunami received far more extensive cover- age in all countries analyzed in both televi- sion and print media. The earthquake in Pakistan, India and Af- ghanistan did not cause as high a death toll as the tsunami, but left more than 3 million people homeless in freezing weather in com- parison with 1.5 million displaced people in tsunami-affected areas of moderate tem- perature. Low media presence contributed to the fact that timely help did not reach the thousands of people living in rugged, mountainous areas which could be accessed only by 70 available helicopters. By contrast 4000 helicopters were available to the areas affected by the tsunami. M EDIA C OVERAGE ON THE TSUNAMI IN A SIA VS .

The current approach of European diplomacy is multi-dimensional, involving the Council of Ministers, the Eu- ropean Commission, the European Parlia- ment and the EU presidency. If decisions are taken through this complicated diplo- matic machinery, they could actually have a strong impact on third countries. But more often than not, such a heavy decision-mak- ing structure hampers rather than facilitates crisis management and too often it does not produce quick results. More than 60 wars are waged around the world with many more tense situations that might evolve into confl icts. The Council has nine special representatives at its disposal. These special representatives are often giv- en a negotiating brief based on the lowest common denominator between EU Member States, which limits their ability to broker deals and solve crises. Many actors in private diplomacy in non- state groups, such as think-tanks, non-gov- ernmental organisations (NGOs), the private sector or religious organisations carry years of experience on the ground and as facilita- tors of dialogue, and have the advantage to having gained trust \u2014 a rare commodity in confl ict ridden areas \u2014 with parties. The case of a successful trust-building exercise for taking part actively in crisis management and confl ict resolution. A second argument is that traditional diplomatic instruments of negotiation and confl ict management have proved to be ineffective, calling for new ap- proaches. Post-modern diplomacy is a pro- fession that includes other agents than states or state-like structures. Some actors in need of mediation would be more inclined to trust a private diplomat (a small \u2018entity\u2019) rather than a state actor, especially when needing a rapid intervention. A third argument, which is gradually surfacing, is that the practice of mediation has not had the opportunity to professionalise itself. Mediation, in fact, is a rubber concept that is being stretched for the political purpose at hand. Confl ict media- tion is a voluntary and confi dential method through a structured process where one or more impartial third parties assist warring factions to reach a mutually satisfactory so- lution. The mediator provides a framework and conducts and facilitates mediation, but makes no substantial suggestion or decisions in this case. The use of this \u2018soft\u2019 instrument in an adequate and systematic fashion could indeed add weight to the \u2018soft\u2019 power of the EU on the world stage. NGOs as natural partners for bolstering the EU\u2019s ability to act and react in crises The complex institutional set-up of the There are dozens of cases where Track II diplomacy has worked successfully \u2014 from the Middle East to Mozambique. And there are many more opportunities that could help solve confl icts, from the South Caucasus to Burma/Myanmar. Why is it that one private person \u2014 Martti Ahtisaari \u2014 is asked to mediate a seemingly intractable confl ict (Aceh, Indonesia), nego- tiates a peace agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) and then enjoys the support of EU Member States to monitor the peace process (the Aceh Monitoring Mission)? At least part of the answer is that the former Finnish President is trusted, is seen as im- partial and has excellent negotiation skills. While the practice of private diplomacy (or Track II diplomacy) is not new, it seems to be blossoming with the EU appointing a grow- ing number of envoys and representatives. A reason could be the resurfacing of confl icts that are often intra- rather than inter-state, whose victims are mainly civilians and which are waged with unconventional weapons and methods, including terrorism. One argument for private diplomacy is that independent, non-partisan actors can suc- cessfully complement or replace governments and international organisations when these (because of restrictive mandates, bureaucra- cy or shrinking budgets) are prevented from M EDIATION AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR CONFLICT PREVENTION AND CRISIS RESPONSE : AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMISE THE IMPACT OF THE EU\u2019 S SOFT POWER Antje Herrberg is a Senior Adviser for Mediation for the Crisis Management Initiative, the Director of Europe for Interpeace and the President of the European Peacebuilding Liaison Offi ce.

While the core principles of mediation are well known \u2014 impartiality, confi dentiality and party driven \u2014 the professional practice of facilitation and mediation are less known in the EU peacebuilding policy community. For example, mediators need to be able to see through positions the underlying inter- ests of parties, which requires specifi c skills to do so. There are no specifi c and system- atic set of instruments in the EU to date that can support the mediation of a peace agree- ment while a number of elements that could be drawn into this already exist. Drawn from the enormous experience at hand in the fi eld of security sector reform, disarmament demobilisation and reintegra- tion (DDR), transitional justice, constitu- tion building and gender mainstreaming, could be synthesized and developed to fi t the needs of a mediation process. The trans- lation of knowledge and experience into operational tools, would need to go hand in hand with training and sensibilisation on mediation practice. A team or the access to staff that can support mediation proc- esses with expert knowledge will increase the chance of translating interests of the parties into peace agreements that have a chance to be sustainable. As any new policy venture, it requires devoting fi nancial and Prevention Network, a cooperative effort by NGOs active in the fi eld of peacebuilding, is one step to bring in some lessons learned from Track II initiatives. It will assess what Track II diplomacy has done so far to help solve confl icts, why it is needed and how it can best be used. This initiative realises that mediation is just one element in peacebuild- ing, which needs to be embedded and ac- companied with dialogue processes for civil society to allow for political participation of societies in post-confl ict environments. Realising the potential of mediation More can be done, especially on the EU institutional front. As the impressive work done by the UN Mediation Support Unit has shown, there is a need to and use for, on the one hand to professionalise and systema- tise know how, but on the other, showing an ability to implement lessons learned in a coherent way. In many ways this requires a paradigm shift in how (European) foreign policy will be implemented in this century and beyond. This would include the crea- tion of a culture of foreign policy that looks beyond zero sum (win-lose) terms or pow- er-based mediation and which will shift to supporting conditions that create mutually acceptable and locally owned agreements. Some governments in Europe which are not members of the EU, such as Switzerland and Norway, have managed to nurture such a culture and are supporting the practice of mediation in many regions of the world, ranging from the Middle East, Nepal, Sudan and Sri Lanka. And these countries are rec- confl ict resolution in Mozambique through the Community of St Egidio is just one case example. At the same time, NGOs provide early warnings of impending confl icts and often act as information brokers and mediators or facilitators of offi cial or unoffi cial negotia- tions. Some are deeply immersed in confl ict prevention, crisis management and confl ict resolution at the grassroots level, working for and with local populations, bringing relevant information to civil servants who spend most of their time analysing information in Brus- sels. And it is NGOs that are the organisa- tions that stay after the conclusion of a peace agreement, oftentimes continuing the media- tion processes with deeply divided societies to prevent further outbreaks and to allow for reconciliation. The EU, in particular the Commission, has now, through the Stability Instrument, an im- portant potential to unleash the partnership that can help to build professional practice. This requires shifting the relationship with NGOs from one where they are executors of projects to a situation where they provide a service to the EU foreign policy. At the same time, for that to happen the NGO commu- nity needs to show increased professionalism and to demonstrate that its interests are not always driven by the need to secure fund- ing. The EU can help build these capacities through provision of core support. The European Commission\u2019s Conflict ",

A stand-by team of Track II organisations could well assist in this process. ",

        "[ 213 ] So, a mix is essential. The \u2018Sant\u2019Egidio Formula\u2019 was a term coined by Boutros Boutros-Ghalli when he was UN Secretary- General and it refers to exactly that blend of the institutional and non-institutional. What are the other challenges that you face? Involving governments is one issue, but it is not the only problem or the largest one. When we began, there was a transitional phase between the Second World War and the Cold War. Many powerful states did not want to get involved in confl ict resolution in Africa because they considered that war and confl ict were inevitable and nothing could be done about it. This pessimistic mentality has spread. Now, many people have a tendency to think that all confl icts are inevitable. Some even talk about something on a far bigger scale: there is the rhetoric of a \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d. At Sant\u2019Egidio, we believe in the opposite of that. We believe that you can always count on humanity and that it is possible to turn a fi ghter into a politician. This is not to say we delude ourselves and deny that there will always be confl ict. What I mean to say is that we can move confl ict from the battlefi eld to the political arena. We can progress from an atmosphere of hate and exclusion to one of dialogue and negotiation. No doubt, partnership is essential when you are engaged in a mediation process. What is the so-called \u2018Sant\u2019Egidio Formula\u2019? At Sant\u2019Egidio, we talk in terms of syn- ergies. A peace process is invariably a long one. When it tries to move too fast it never works. Every situation is unique and that requires a certain expertise. You have to har- monise yourself with the reality of a confl ict, so of course we need a lot of partnerships. We need local partners in particular, because they have direct experience of the confl ict. You also need institutional partners. We don\u2019t believe in parallel or privatised diplo- macy. The term \u2018track II diplomacy\u2019 is often used but I prefer the term \u2018track I and a half\u2019 because you need a synergy between insti- tutional and non-institutional. A non-institutional civil society organisa- tion such as Sant\u2019Egidio is able to intervene in a confl ict with much greater ease than an institutional actor because we are able to wait. We can keep time management open, have patience, and keep faith in a situation until the time and situation is ripe. Many representatives from NGOs ask me how Sant\u2019Egidio can act in competition with states. My answer to them is that we have the opposite problem: getting state actors in- volved. You also have to consider that states are always needed to guarantee and arbi- trate, in signing or implementing a peace agreement for example. What is Sant\u2019Egidio\u2019s membership base and scope of work? Sant\u2019Egidio has a membership of around 55,000 and across 70 countries. It works on combating poverty and undertaking social actions. In the last 20 years, it has also in- vested a lot of effort in the fi eld of con- fl ict resolution, but of course it continues the social work that it has always been in- volved in. Regarding confl ict resolution, our fi rst in- volvement was in 1982 in Lebanon. Since then, we have mediated in Mozambique, Guatemala, Burundi, Algeria, Kosovo/a, Liberia, Togo, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Nepal and most recently Darfur. How does Sant\u2019Egidio decide to become involved in a mediation process? It is a question asked today that we did not ask in the past because nobody was work- ing on \u201cconfl ict resolution\u201d. In the case of Mozambique, we simply went because no- body else did. There was no civil society organisation at that time that was tackling crisis management or confl ict resolution at all levels. How we make such a decision to- day depends on the requests we receive. We can receive an invitation to become involved from a wide variety of different actors. It can come from groups, states, civil society, or churches. M EDIATION BASED ON CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP I NTERVIEW WITH M ARIO G IRO Mario Giro is a member of Sant\u2019Egidio, an international, ecclesiastical community that was founded in Rome in 1968. His role has a particular focus on West Africa and he is responsible for Sant\u2019Egidio\u2019s international relations as a whole. With an involvement in the Sant\u2019Egidio that stretches back over two decades, Giro has personally mediated in many confl icts worldwide. ",
        "[ 214 ] There must always be a synergy. When states are able to do something, it\u2019s better that they are the ones to do it. What they can\u2019t do can sometimes be done by the non- institutional sector. I have another job to get on with. I am a trade unionist, and I am responsible for the international matters for Sant\u2019Egidio. When there is mediation to do, I dedicate myself entirely to it. It\u2019s good to have other things to do and then focus all efforts on mediat- ing talks when the time comes. In between, it is about maintaining links and contacts. It requires a long-term engagement. What are your hopes for the future? It seems to me that confl ict resolution has become fashionable. A lot of people are studying or discussing it. But what I also see is that very few people are actually tak- ing action on the ground. You could say there are fewer than 10 organisations, not counting the institutions, which are engag- ing hands-on in that way. We do far too little mediation and facilita- tion. We talk a lot: maybe too much if you consider just how many confl icts are ongo- ing in the world. Personally, I think there is a lot of scope to do more than what is happening at the moment. What we need is fewer words and more action! A mediation based on threats does not work either. As we saw in Darfur, a peace agreement can be signed but immediately re- nounced afterwards. These situations call for long-term work and that requires confi dence and friendship. You could say it\u2019s a pedagogi- cal process too. You have to harmonise yourself with the root causes of the confl ict, which are almost never economic. Economic factors are there but they come in at a second level to perpetu- ate or give sense to a confl ict. Other reasons are usually at the root. You have to listen and be patient enough to let others have their say. This can be done more easily by a non- institutional organisation, ideally working in partnership with institutions, of course. Apart from patience and willingness to lis- ten, what does it take to be a good mediator in your experience? The best mediator is one who also has other work to do. Allow me to clarify that. Media- tors from civil society, outside an institutional context, can only count on their personal credibility or that of their organisation. A mediator who is too professionalized runs the risk of being personally dependent on the success of the mediation. That is a potential weakness. The advantage of the non-institu- tional mediator is the right to failure and that is a luxury that states cannot afford. What is the fi rst step to take in mediation talks if you are confronted by the kind of pessimistic attitudes you describe? The fi rst step is to build confi dence be- tween the actors. It is always possible to convince the actors that there is another way to achieve their objectives. Most civil wars \u2014 remembering that 80 per cent of confl icts are internal ones \u2014 are a question of exclu- sion and recognition. We can show a path to guarantee recognition of rights without the use of arms. You need patience for that. Consider Uganda where we negotiated with the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army from 1996 to 2006. Af- ter the fi rst contact in 1996, there were 10 years of intermittent contact, silence, and re-establishing contact. That is the nature of the work that needs to be done, so you must have political conviction from the start. Only then can the peace process also take hold among the population. Peace requires a long process of recon- ciliation that must be taken on by the par- ties concerned. You cannot impose peace on people. It is that attitude that leads to fro- zen confl icts. The major example of that is Bosnia-Herzegovina. We can deploy thou- sands of troops but if you want to get to the root of a confl ict and resolve it, you have to take the necessary time to convince the peo- ple involved to move towards peace. ",

        "[ 237 ] The Thai authorities have announced that they intend to screen all the inhabitants of the camp before sending them back to Laos in order to determine whether some of them qualify for protective status. Resettlement to third countries is being refused by the Thais in fear of the often-cited 'pull-factor' that such an operation might exert. In spite of sev- eral demands, UNHCR has not been allowed to participate substantially in the screening process on the Thai side. They have merely been asked to provide minimum input in form of a briefi ng on UNHCR's standard Refugee Status Determination criteria and procedures to Thai MFA staff who would supposedly be involved in the screening process. The 37th Sub-General Border Committe of Laos and Thailand approved the return of all these Lao Hmong by the end of 2008. Some 270 have already returned this year, seemingly volun- tarily, but at the end of Maythe expectation that the rate of return would be accelerated incited the refugees to burn some 850 houses in the camp (over two thirds of the total), and many are now living under tents. The Lao Hmong caseload in Nong Khai detention centre Since early December 2006, a group of 153 Lao Hmong have been jailed in a de- tention centre in Thailand under inhumane conditions. Among the 153 refugees - that are recognised to be in need of protection by UNHCR - are 90 children. Several coun- While UNHCR has never offi cially been allowed to carry out a status determina- tion in the camp it is estimated that the majority of the Hmong population con- sists of economic migrants. However, the group also comprises a few hundred cases of Lao Hmong who credibly assert to have fl ed persecution in their country of origin and who hence have legitimate protection claims. The Thai government refuses to recog- nize the Hmong people in Huai Nam Khao camp as refugees or people of concern, and considers them as illegal immigrants. In this regard the Thai government has ar- gued that sending illegal immigrants back to their country of origin is not a violation of international law. While the Lao authorities depict the liv- ing conditions of the Hmong returnees as bright, the experience of other Lao Hmong refugees who have been forcibly returned to Laos presents quite a different picture (e.g. the group of 27 children that went missing in late 2005 - the girls among the group claim to have endured repeated beatings, rapes, and other abuses during their deten- tion in Laos following their deportation, the fi ve boys are still missing). On the other hand, there have not been any reports of ill-treatment of more recent returnees (270 in the fi rst half of 2008). Historical background The secret wars of Laos date back to the La- otian Civil War (1962-1975) where the Com- munist Pathet Lao and the Royal Laotian Government fought for control over the Lao- tian panhandle, which the North Vietnamese had occupied to use as a supply corridor. The war was supported by North Vietnamese, American and South Vietnamese military forces. The Pathet Lao emerged victorious in 1975, along with the general communist vic- tory in Indochina that year. An estimated 80 per cent of men from the Laos Hmong people were recruited to fi ght the Communist Pathet Lao. After the communist victory the Hmong people were targeted for retaliation and per- secution. Many fl ed the country but of those who were left in Laos, 2000-3000 were sent to re-education camps. Many Hmongs died in these camps. Thousands more fl ed to the remote mountainous areas of the jungle from which they staged rebel attacks on the rul- ing government. An estimated 2,000-12,000 Hmongs are still displaced in these remote areas from fear of government retaliation.

First contacts with the US Embassy in Vientiane suggest that this may be an option. This solution would pro- vide a face-saving approach to ending the deadlock that these 153 refugees have been caught in since almost one year now. Progress to date and activities in 2008 Over the last year the Delegation in Laos has sought to improve the policy dialogue with government interlocutors on the issue of the Hmong through bilateral meetings and through the framework of the Infor- mal Group of Likeminded Donors. Europe- an Commission employees have also par- ticipated in several missions organized by the Government to visit resettled emigrants, amongst which are frequently groups of eth- nic Lao Hmong. In a very encouraging step, the French Human Rights ambassador was also given access to visit the new Hmong villages in Taklak. In 2008, the EC Delegation in Vientiane plans to pursue the policy dialogue on these issues through the joint Lao-EC working Group on Governance and Human Rights. High profi le visits, such as that of the Com- missioner for External Relations, Ferrero- Waldner (expected at some point in 2008/9), will also be used to put the spotlight on the Lao Hmong issue and emphasize the impor- tance that the European Union has bestowed to Laos as an essential pre-condition for EC support to be forthcoming. In addition, the EC advocates for an exploratory mission of Hmong refugees' representatives to be or- ganised in order to allow them to visit the foreseen resettlement site on the Lao side as a confi dence-building measure. To end the stalemate surrounding the Nong Khai caseload consisting of recognised refugees, the EC will continue to push the Lao authori- ties to agree to a \"face-saving\" solution for the detained Hmong in form of resettlement to third countries as migrants. The Lao position The Lao Government had made the fi rm demand that no third party should be in- cluded in the repatriation process as a pre- condition for any negotiation with Thai- land on the Hmong issue. However, during discussions with the EC, various high-level interlocutors on the Lao side have signaled some degree of openness to associating IOM to the repatriation process of the Huai Nam Khao caseload as well as to ensuring a cer- tain 'traceability' of the returnees by the dip- lomatic community and to allowing NGOs access to the resettlement sites. However, no concrete steps have followed. The situation of the Nong Khai caseload is in a stalemate as the Lao government refuses to authorise the Royal Thai Government to resettle the group in third countries. The Lao Government has recently stated that they might be agreeable to allowing re- tries had offered to accept this caseload for resettlement but the Thai authorities refused by again citing the pull-factor as well as their bilateral commitment to Lao PDR to return the group to Laos. Two deportation attempts of the Thai authorities have failed due to strong protests of the international community as well as fi erce resistance by the refugees themselves leading the Thai gov- ernment to agree to halt deportation (while at the same time refusing to release them). Tensions have risen in this camp recently as a result of the placement of three Lao Loum who are perceived as spies by the Hmong. What is the European Commission\u2019s position? The European Commission is following the issue of the Lao Hmong very closely both from Headquarters and from its Delegations in Laos and Thailand. The EC position is shaped by protection and human rights con- cerns for the Hmong refugees. As regards the Huai Nam Khao caseload, the EC will insist vis-\u00e0-vis the Thai authorities that a proper screening mechanism should be put in place in order to determine their protection needs and effectively identify people of concern. The EC insist on the importance of engaging an independent third party, such as IOM, to be associated to the repatriation process to ensure that it is voluntary and have condi- tioned support to the resettlement of Hmong on these principles being followed.

        "[ 241 ] donor states and opposition organisations are trying to infl uence the population and use the reconstruction phase to enhance their reputation. In Lebanon, for example, Hezbollah supported the Shiite population in South Beirut\u2019s Dachieh , the Shiite dis- trict, which was heavily damaged by Israeli bombardments in the war. The fi nancial emergency support ranged from cash to goods to meet people\u2019s daily needs. Peo- ple\u2019s misery was mitigated as a result. The same support went to the south of Leba- non, where villages were badly damaged. The government of Lebanon appeared to be somewhat paralysed, and was not able to provide sustainable aid for this part of the population. In the security sector, we faced the same needs. An analysis of the state of the German Adviser Team exposed an imbalance be- tween the equipment of the different se- curity agencies. While in the socio-eco- nomic sector, a huge number of support offers were coming in and NGOs provided the basic work required for stabilisation, the security sector encountered problems because of the different preferences of the participating countries. Especially in secu- rity sector reform, the individual interests of donor states play a role that should not be underestimated. These encompass economic as well as political interests, and can pro- an international police or military mission turned out to hamper rather than help sta- bilisation. To give an example of action in the stabilisation phase after the 33-Day War in Lebanon, Germany provided federal police offi cers and customs offi cers who were intended to be the focus of an adviser operation to support the Lebanese security agencies, with the aim of enhancing their capability to execute their duties. In the po- litical arena, this presence was a precondi- tion for lifting the air embargo and opening the airport to permit the import of goods urgently needed to meet the inhabitants\u2019 daily living requirements. The suspension of hostilities and the lifting of the air embargo, and one day later the sea embargo, which was lifted due to the presence of the Ger- man Maritime Task Force close to Lebanese territorial waters, helped the population to step back into a regular pattern of life. Transition phase and multi-level approach In the transition phase it is important to work with a multi-level approach. Es- sentially the stabilisation of the socio-eco- nomic situation and public security need to be pursued as priorities. This seems to be very important in confl ict areas where the population have suffered a lot from violent actions. This is more diffi cult if, in addi- tion to governmental organisations (GOs), Introduction In crisis management and post-confl ict situations we often realise that the formal crisis state was triggered too late and the end of the crisis was announced too ear- ly. The question of when exactly a crisis comes to an end is a theoretical one, and an exact time cannot usually be determined. However, the important lesson is that the phase of consolidation should be initiated as soon as possible. This is clearly appar- ent from the 33-Day War between Israel and Lebanon in 2006. In this case the cri- sis itself was already obvious long before the Israeli bombardments began.

        "[ 242 ] International formulas and methods Choosing the right method is the key. In- ternational organisations often tend to use standard methods, systems and interven- tion mechanisms without adapting them suffi ciently to the political, cultural and religious specifi cs of the situation. If these specifi cs are taken into consideration a clear road map should materialise. The lessons learned in Lebanon in 2006-2007 support this thesis. There must be an in-depth anal- ysis of the current situation \u2014 based on all open sources and intelligence work \u2014 in every confl ict area before any decision is made on the kind of international interven- tion mechanism that should be implement- ed. So, in September 2006 the indications were clear that no uniformed military or police mission would be welcome in Leba- non in addition to the long-term United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) contingent based in the south of the coun- try. These facts played an important role for the Syrian border. According to this philos- ophy, the toolbox contained only a limited range of mechanisms. There was no room either to extend the UN mandate to cover an executive police mission or to establish a uniformed EU police mission (e.g. European Union Border Assistance Mission [EUBAM] or European Security and Defence Policy [ESDP]). The government of Lebanon clearly pointed out that the bilateral engagement of adviser missions or EU project manage- ment (in twinning projects) could be suc- cessful and would be welcomed. This led to the quick elaboration of a pilot project in does not make the task easier. There is a dual risk in the performance of aid and provision of contributions to consumers. One the one hand, there is sometimes too much equip- ment that is not appropriate and not utilised as forseen. On the other side demands are not met because needs were not detected in time, or the available fi nance had already been used for other purposes. Nevertheless the recommendation remains that confl ict states should be required to take responsi- bility for the coordination of donors and aid for reconstruction and development. This behaviour would facilitate the idea of local ownership and overall responsibility for the whole reconstruction process. Al- though the crisis in Lebanon still exists at least in a formal sense, the German Advi- sor Team strictly maintains a role as merely an adviser in the Border Management. The Lebanese authorities have the responsibility for the elaboration and implementation of the Integrated Border Management. There are also security reasons for donor agencies to play no more than an advisory role. For political reasons a considerable number of confl ict countries refuse to ac- cept the presence of international uniformed police forces. Lebanon is one of them. One reason is that the presence of uniformed in- ternational forces would be seen as a hostile act by Lebanon\u2019s neighbour Syria. From this perspective it is important to focus on the right approach and the use of the right for- mulas and tools. It is always important to be aware of the impact of the aid activity. vide the impression that aim of the exercise is less effi cient aid and the improvement of physical security than the achievement of the donor\u2019s own objectives. In effect, the project is used as a basis for donors to achieve their own selfi sh aims. In Lebanon at the start of the transi- tion phase, the different security agencies worked totally separately and there was no exchange of information or cooperation. They were self-suffi cient. The equipment and training of each participating agency were extremely different. While some of the donor countries provided equipment and training that seemed to be based exclusively on their own interests, the German Adviser Team chose a comprehensive multi-agen- cy approach. In a pilot project all security agencies were encouraged to develop com- mon responsibility for Integrated Border Management. Donor states were motivated to contribute according to their capacities and budgets. Donor coordination and local ownership The coordination of the activities of do- nor states is an important role, which should usually be handed over to the confl ict coun- tries themselves. They should be obliged to fulfi l this task. However, long-term experi- ence has shown that confl ict countries often do not have the capability to manage the task. The huge number of donor states, GOs and NGOs acting in a very enthusiastic and engaged way during the stabilisation phase ",

This meant that the project had to be implemented in a short period of time and the impact on the project management structure and timeframe was obvious. Some 750 members of the dif- ferent security agencies had to be educated in border management, a training centre and a common operation centre had to be set up, and it was also necessary to procure the equipment needed. In a short timeline, experts had to elaborate a training concept to prepare the offi cers on the ground. Beside these measures, there was a need for careful public relations, to explain to the population in the border region that Integrated Border Management would not interfere with their daily livelihood and that they would still be able to cross the border. The international pressure on the Lebanese government to execute resolution 1701 was very intense, and remains so at the time of writing. A deliberate decision was made to carry out the pilot project in a area with a low profi le in the region. This was done with the aim of minimising the risks for fi - nancial investment and security. The pilot project was intended to show the interna- tional donor community whether the Leba- nese security agencies and the government were capable of securing their borders. This should give a clear perspective for further investment and engagement in the future. The donor community saw the project as an optimal test run, to discover how far equip- ment and capacity building is sustainable, before the much farther-reaching strategic population. In Lebanon, there are 18 dif- ferent major religious groups. All security agencies will be perceived as favouring one or more religions, due to the known faith of the director-general of the organisation. Strict neutrality and a united front in ex- ecuting the road map ease up the procedures in the stabilisation work. However, experi- ence has shown that although this common front is desirable, it is often missing in real- ity. It is more common for the specifi c inter- ests of donor countries to be apparent than for a common approach to be followed. To establish a united front, strong leadership is necessary. Project management and road map The form of project management applied depends mainly on the political situation and the goal it is hoped to achieve. It is nec- essary to have project management with a fi rm theoretical and scientifi c foundation in order to develop effective approaches and achieve the project goal within the time- frame. However, the intensity of the project management should be related to the con- ditions on the ground. Each project should have an individual road map which takes into account the specifi c local conditions. A paste and copy system takes this into ac- count only in a limited way. The German Adviser Team evolved a pilot project for Integrated Border Management for North Lebanon based on a European philosophy: to test the capacities and the willingness of the Lebanese authorities in surveying their border with Syria. There was heavy pressure North Lebanon, and also to a feasible per- spective from which to initiate a bilateral or EU project on the eastern border. We should be careful not to copy experi- ence from Afghanistan or the Balkan states in the fi eld of border management and the public security sector without careful re- fl ection. It is rather diffi cult for police and military practitioners to avoid taking an executive role and adhere to an advisory mandate. But this seems to be important, to ensure there is e.g. Lebanese \u2018ownership\u2019 of the project management in Lebanon. The acceptance of an intelligent and independ- ent partner, and the right alongside to de- cide how far the country wants to go is a key factor for success. Specifi c note should be made of unarmed international missions, which could be seen as a bridge or compro- mise between an advisory role and a uni- formed armed mission. International mis- sions usually have high prestige, but it is questionable how successful an unarmed international mission can be. The limitation of its capabilities immediately reduces the intervention capacities. Further mention should also be made of the importance of neutrality in the fi eld of crisis stabilisation. Although countries and regional unions may take clear political po- sitions in political, military or policing mat- ters, these should be translated into action in the \u2018transition zone\u2019, which should maintain a strictly neutral stance. Neutrality is often important in countries with multi-religious ",
        "[ 244 ] The preparatory phase is marked by work- ing through the specifi ed work packages; the specifi cations of these work packages will follow separately containing details and timeframes. In principle, it will not be possible to enter the implementation phase until all phase-specifi c work packages have been successfully completed. Project duration The time required for the preparatory phase depends on the level of cooperation shown by the Lebanese side, the delivery times of the required equipment and fa- cilities and on the length of the necessary advanced training measures. It is there- fore not possible to say yet how long it will take. However, the estimation that this phase could take fi ve months seems to be realistic. The implementation phase of the pilot project is to be limited to three months maximum. The follow-up phase is to last one month. During this phase, the tasks are to be per- formed within the meaning of the project in order to ensure it can begin immediately in the north-eastern and eastern section of the border once it has been completed successfully. Opportunities offered by the pilot project During talks with other donor countries, it became evident that apart from the pilot of Lebanon that will take the conditions in Lebanon adequately into account. The specifi c defi nition of project objec- tives will be based strictly on the evaluation report drawn up by the German Project Bu- reau and on the common defi ned need for action. The project specifi cations stipulate that effi cient use will be made of person- nel, that optimised equipment and facilities will enhance cooperation and hence com- munication between the security authorities involved, and that tactical changes will be made. Furthermore, interfaces are to be re- duced and optimised cooperation between the individual authorities is to open up the possibility of using synergy effects. At present, there are no plans to modify the statutory task and competency alloca- tions of the security authorities involved. This would contravene the current political conditions and pose certain risks. It is not the objective of the pilot project either to demilitarise control of the green border or to set up a higher-ranking border control authority. However, this does not rule out the possibility of structural and organisa- tional changes being made by the security authorities in due course. Project implementation in phases The pilot project is to be implemented in three phases: a preparatory phase followed by an implementation phase, with the pi- lot project being concluded by a follow-up phase. planning process and investment planning started to survey the eastern border. The pilot project \u2018integrated border management\u2019 North Lebanon Area of responsibility The pilot project is to be confi ned geo- graphically to the area of competence of the 5 th Brigade of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) along the northern border between Lebanon and Syria, taking in the crossing points El Aarida and Aboudiyeh. The operational area will begin in the west at the Gulf of Sidra at El Aarrida and will end to the east of Hmair\u00e9. Project objectives The project is intended to be both the nucleus and actual test phase for future in- tegrated border management of Lebanon. The Lebanese security authorities involved are to be acquainted with the benefi ts of integrated border management. Specified indicators are to highlight whether or not the project has been a suc- cess and following subsequent evaluation they will provide the basis and set the trend for the development of a state-of-the-art national border strategy for Lebanon. When evaluating the success of the project, the fi ndings of monitoring and the experience gained by the Lebanese side will need to be taken into account in order to fi nally be able to develop a viable system of in- tegrated border management for the whole ",
        "[ 245 ] Outlook The pilot project for implementing inte- grated border management will lead to the development of a national security network between the various security authorities in- volved with border control and customs du- ties in terms of its overall confi guration. If the project objectives are achieved, it is planned to expand the pilot project to other border regions within the framework of a national border strategy for Lebanon. As such, it is up to the Lebanese decision- makers to perhaps consider setting up a national border control authority. This should go hand in hand with considera- tions to enhance the infrastructure at cross- ing points and the green border. Further- more, the location of some border crossing points should be reconsidered given their distance from the actual borderline itself. In addition, the need for clear demarcation of the land border with Syria should be taken into account. In particular, any social and finan- cial changes resulting from the follow-up project would need to be taken into account in future. They would have to be made up for by social projects concomitantly. The fi nal objective is to continue with the project management under a European umbrella in future. be optimised in the near future if equip- ment aid is provided. The simplicity and clarity of the pilot project is also expressed in the targeted application of the principles governing project management and quality manage- ment, and is hence likely to be a success without necessitating any far-reaching or- ganisational changes or even modifi cations to the statutory job descriptions of the se- curity authorities at this early stage. It also needs to be mentioned that with this type of pilot project the German orien- tation of integrated border management in Lebanon will be maintained if the German project work is transferred to the project framework of the European Union. Once the structures of a successful pilot project have been established, it would no longer be that easy to deviate from them. Risks involved in the pilot project The positive international response can be attributed not least to the fact that the investment tied up in the pilot project did not involve any risks. If the project were to fail, against all expectations, this would not necessarily mean the investment would have been wasted because, for instance, any equipment and facilities procured could certainly be distributed expediently according to other criteria and any accom- panying advanced training measures could be appropriately diverted. project proposed here, there is also a lack of reliable concepts worthwhile investing in. By and large, individual measures are implemented on the basis of bilateral agree- ments or at the request of the Lebanese se- curity authorities. However, the endeavours of the international donor countries are fo- cusing specifi cally on structured concepts, which is precisely why this particular pilot project has met with such widespread inter- national acceptance. The pilot project has already prompted several donor countries to offer the prospect of funding. The pilot project offers huge opportuni- ties. In view of the explosiveness of the situation within Lebanon, which calls for incisive optimisation measures along the Lebanese borders, the project happens to be the right step at the right time, with- out demanding too much in an initial ap- proach. The carefully selected operational section for the project will help matters as no special interests dominate. This will make it easy to implement any such un- dertaking in terms of interior policy. The pilot project will make it possible to glean valuable organisational fi ndings that may well apply to the whole of Lebanon. The establishment of a joint operations cen- tre can also be seen in this light as it will bring the individual players together and will have a confi dence-building effect. The Lebanese authorities reserve the right to take organisational decisions themselves. It is noted irrespective of how the project develops that the current situation can only ",

        "[ 247 ] Oloo Otieno is project director of the Non- violent Peaceforce (NP) project in northern Uganda, where the project is currently in its planning phase. Otieno, who is based in the northern Ugandan city of Gulu, is experienced in protective accompaniment and as a trainer in non-violent confl ict resolution. One of the goals of NP in Uganda is to have a civilian- based grassroots foundation for sustainable peace. Prior to his post in Uganda, Otieno was a member of the NP pilot project in Sri Lanka. \u2018P EOPLE ARE TIRED OF WAR !\u2019: SUPPORTING THE PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN U GANDA I NTERVIEW WITH O LOO O TIENO The rise of Ugandan President Yoweri Mu- seveni and his National Resistance Move- ment in 1986 coincided with the escalation of a notorious rebel movement, the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA). The group, led by Joseph Kony, has been engaged in an armed rebellion against the Ugandan government in what has been one of Africa\u2019s longest- running confl icts. Based in northern Uganda and southern Sudan, the LRA is accused of widespread human rights violations, includ- ing mutilation, torture, rape, the use of child soldiers and a number of massacres. The scope of the violence is almost unbelievable: nearly two million northern Ugandans have been forced to fl ee their homes, most living in over-crowded, unsanitary and danger- ous camps. The LRA has abducted an esti- mated 20,000 children in northern Uganda to serve as soldiers or sex slaves. In 2006, peace talks began in Juba, Sudan, and later that year the government and the LRA and the government signed a truce, which both sides have violated. Arrest warrants of Kony and his top commanders by the Interna- tional Criminal Court (ICC) remains a po- litical stumbling block for genuine peace in northern Uganda. How did Nonviolent Peaceforce evolve, and what is the organisation\u2019s mission? The idea for Nonviolent Peaceforce start- ed at the 1999 Hague Appeal for Peace. A group of American individuals with similar ideas bumped into each other after one of them had shouted about the need for civil- ian peacekeeping. After the meeting they went back home and started organising and devising their approach. They managed to organise support from different civil soci- ety groups working in peacekeeping, peace- building and non-violence. When the group secured support from a number of organisa- tions all over the world a conference was or- ganised in India in 2002. There they founded the Nonviolent Peaceforce. A number of countries were proposed to begin with: Burma/Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Guatemala, Palestine\u2014Israel. Af- ter doing a thorough assessment of each country they settled on Sri Lanka. A feasi- bility study was quickly initiated. A group of three people went to Sri Lanka to meet with civil society groups and government offi cials to assess if there was a need for an international civilian peacekeeping organi- sation. This need was established, fundrais- ing started and the fi rst team was sent in September 2003. I was a member of the fi rst fi eld team that was recruited, interviewed and sent for spe- cialised training. We had 18 days of rigorous training in teambuilding, theories of third- party, non-violent intervention, communica- tion, as well as skills that would be needed with the police and public administration. Also during the training there were psycho- logical and stress tests. Our team of 11 inter- nationals from nine countries was deployed in Sri Lanka to work alongside Sri Lankan civil society and peace activists. The NP programme in Uganda is in its preparatory phase. Can you describe the background of the confl ict and what NP aims to do? The confl ict in Uganda has been ongoing for 25 years. It mostly centres around issues of alienation and marginalisation of certain communities in terms of distribution of nat- ural resources, employment, education, etc. This is the basis on which the rebels started this war. When the top rebel commanders were indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) [in 2005], this was a tremendous attempt to pressure the rebels to start think- ing of alternatives to violence. The govern- ment had also intensifi ed the military opera- tion against the rebels. This meant the rebels started to withdraw and think twice about their next step. I think this prompted them to take seriously the issue of negotiation and the peace process. The government of south- ern Sudan also started putting pressure on the rebels because they were operating from Sudanese bases. Southern Sudan was just signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and things were moving along. They did not want any negative groups operating from ",

Now the community is questioning the \u2018moral identity\u2019 of these children, claim- ing they are bad blood coming back into society to wreak havoc. The young mothers are also facing stigma, and they need our support, protection and someone to speak on their behalf. NP is a non-violence-based organisation. How does this fi gure into a context in which violence is so present? Do people think non- violence is relevant? Yes, they do. People are tired are war! They want to go back to their homes; they\u2019re tired of camp life. Everyone wants to start a meaningful life and fi nd a role to play in rebuilding community and society. Any- thing that promotes non-violence, promotes peace or promotes coexistence is welcome in Northern Uganda. Particularly ex-com- batants returning to their communities are struggling to fi nd a safe place to discuss what happened during the period of vio- lent confl ict. They need a forum to express the aspirations they have and the roles they want to play in society. For us, this is what Nonviolent Peaceforce is looking into do- ing: creating a safe place for these people to share their stories, to come to terms with reality and how to overcome the stigma and psychological trauma they went through. Some of these young people were forced to kill their family, forced to kill small chil- dren and forced to kill pregnant mothers. It\u2019s just awful. onciliation, the overall peacekeeping and protection of vulnerable community mem- bers. Also, we are working alongside the framework of the Ugandan government. The government created an elaborate document this year called the recovery and reconstruc- tion strategy for northern Uganda. This is a document on which the government insists all humanitarian and peace organisations base their interventions. We are currently liaising with local gov- ernment representatives at district level as well as the police. This is particularly centred on community policing and trying to strengthen the relationship and confi - dence between the community and the po- lice. In the past people shied away from re- porting criminal cases, so they established a \u2018community police\u2019 that addresses this relationship. Meanwhile local governments are in- volved in settling land wrangles between communities and individuals. After 25 years of war and people staying in refugee camps, a lot of boundaries and landmarks have been removed. For example, land demarcations had been trees, rocks or anthills. Now peo- ple are coming back and trying to fi gure out where their land was. In northern Uganda there are no permanent structures or build- ings. There are just temporary shelters such as huts, so it is almost impossible to fi nd out where your house was. These are some of the things the communities are facing. Also, there are issues of identity and re- integration. During the confl ict in northern Uganda young ladies have been forcibly within their territory that could jeopardise the peace agreement. This process of peace negotiations in the southern capital city of Juba had re- ally brought some hope among internally displaced persons (IDPs) to start returning home. There was good political will from both opposition parties in Uganda as well as the ruling party. The government asked peo- ple to go back home and gave assurance that the ground situation had improved and they were safe. So, people started moving back home. Some started going through transit sites because they had suspicions that things might turn worse. Also, they wanted time to visit their ancestral home, to have that psychological connection before they made the fi nal return. For us in Nonviolent Peace- force this process presented an opportunity to help support the efforts and initiatives of local peace activists, civil society and human rights groups working there. Two of our partner groups in Uganda had asked NP to consider setting up a pro- gramme to help support them in their work. They wanted us to share experiences about what we had achieved in Sri Lanka and to also have international community sup- port behind them. This is how we decided to move into Uganda. In June 2007 we re- ally started to concretise the expectations from our local partners and what they could expect from us. It is important that we all move forward with a common understand- ing, or else there will be big problems. We will be pursuing several approaches in terms of strengthening community dialogue, rec- ",
        "[ 249 ] an entrenched traditional justice and rec- onciliation mechanism regarding how to deal with crime. I think they are the only community in East Africa that has strong traditional leadership for settling disputes and offering judgment against community members. Recently the Acholi Paramount Chief was involved in negotiating between a politician and a military general over a land dispute. He summoned both parties to sit down, discuss and look for a solu- tion. Within one month it was solved, and it couldn\u2019t, or hadn\u2019t, been solved by the national court system. Ugandans have a very strong sense for this traditional way of dealing with confl ict. It is what they want to see in the case of the LRA, too. During a series of consultations about the accountability and reconciliation protocol that was signed between the government and the LRA, many people said they didn\u2019t want The Hague process. There was a feel- ing that if they simply arrested [LRA rebel leader] Joseph Kony and his commanders, they would be hanged in The Hague. No one would see the bodies or have a chance to talk to Kony to hear him apologise. This is obviously a huge lack of infor- mation; people do not know that in The Hague they do not have the death penalty. People did not understand what happened to Milo\u0161evi \u0107 \u2014 they thought he was mur- dered. They want Kony to come out of the bush, whereby there would be an elaborate cleansing ceremony and a process of justice and reconciliation. They want Kony and his top commanders to meet the victims and to engage the community in dialogue and look for solutions to re-integrate and coexist with ex-combatants. They, too, have a role to play in society. Most of them were ab- ducted against their will and the community must come to terms with this. They have lost a lot of energetic young people who want and need to be instrumental in rebuilding the society. This is an area we want to con- tinue to engage both communities and also the government. You\u2019ve spoken a bit about the indictments made by the ICC. There had been some or- ganisations subtly working with the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) to broker a peace agreement before the ICC came out with its indictments. Were the ICC indictments a setback? There are a few reactions to this. First, the indictments made by the ICC at The Hague were a major push for the rebels to sober up and start thinking about a more positive, constructive way to end the confl ict. Gener- ally, it was agreed that the indictments were a wake-up call that the international com- munity will not let the rebels go without punishment. It really made them stick to the peace process. On the contrary, local com- munities, both religious leaders in northern Uganda and the Acholi diaspora, are advo- cating for the ICC to slowly withdraw the arrest warrants issued for the LRA\u2019s lead- ership. The argument is that withdrawing the indictments would let the peace proc- ess proceed. Second, people throughout Uganda have Also, there is a problem of people being harmed by \u2018evil spirits\u2019. In Africa we be- lieve in these spirits \u2014 in this case the spir- its of people that were killed. I was talking to a woman recently who cannot conceive a child; every time she tries to conceive she miscarries. She visited a diviner who said, \u2018you shot a pregnant woman, and this woman is having an effect in your life\u2019. The diviner told her she needed to have a cleans- ing ceremony before she could appease the spirit and have a child. There are some within international hu- manitarian organisations who are trying to raise funds to help with this kind of thing. A cleansing ceremony to become whole again is very expensive. You have to buy certain number of animals for slaughter- ing and cleansing. The total cost is about \u20ac 120 per individual. Most of these people are poor and cannot afford a full cleans- ing process. Many young men and women who have come back from the bush are recruited by vocational training centres. Once they grad- uate and start a trade in carpentry, met- al working or dressmaking they are really eager to start working. But you often fi nd they get customers who say, \u2018I don\u2019t want this person who has killed somebody, who has spilled blood, to do something for me! I don\u2019t want these people to construct my house or make me a chair to sit on\u2019. This is an attitude which frustrates the ef- forts of ex-combatants who then say, \u2018Ok, I will go grab a gun, go back to the bush and exercise my power\u2019. At NP we really want ",
        "[ 250 ] European Union has never made a strong political statement in support of the peace process in Juba. One of the active players has been the United States. But when the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs came to Kampala recently, she made an infl ammatory statement that the United States will wipe out the LRA if they don\u2019t behave. The LRA spokesperson basically said in response, \u2018we are waiting in the bush for you; come anytime you like. It seems you did not learn to listen in Somalia, and you cannot solve problems in Iraq and Afghani- stan \u2014 we are ready to receive you\u2019. The statement by the US Assistant Sec- retary of State for African Affairs angered northern Ugandan leadership. One Anglican bishop, Rt. Revd Ochola, who is very instru- mental in the peace process, wrote a protest letter to George W. Bush. He said, \u2018we want you to support the peace process but we don\u2019t want you to jeopardise it\u2019. This RELEX-sponsored conference has made it even clearer to me that the EU is applying a \u2018soft power\u2019 strategy in dealing with violent confl icts. This is what we\u2019re calling for, and we want the EU to play a major role in sustaining the peace process in northern Uganda. During his presentation at the conference, Johan Galtung posed a powerful challenge that the EU will have to fi ll a vacuum, as the United States is beginning to become rather infamous. We hope its role will be to fi ll this vacuum non-militarily and sup- port civilian peacekeeping. The EU has the potential to support organisations that are rest. The government of Uganda, through their embassy in Kinshasa, tried to intervene. They tried to access Makasi; after all, he is a Ugandan national, and they wanted to talk to him and bring him back to Uganda. Up to now the government of Congo has not allowed Uganda to access him. This is just a political game. The president of Congo, Joseph Kabila, is not comfortable with the Ugandan government because of a potential threat that Uganda may invade Congo. Of course, having Congolese police go into the bush to arrest Kony and the LRA leader- ship cannot work. This is the on-the-ground situation that the ICC faces. They don\u2019t have practical way of arresting Kony and his com- manders. The government of Uganda sup- ports the traditional justice system, and this is why they are also consulting their citizens to fi nd out their views about the procedure and whether they favour it or not. The com- munity and the victims have not been heard properly. LRA negotiations have started very recently, and it has been very emotional. The rebels conveyed an apology from Kony and his commanders. Now people are expecting to hear from Kony himself when he comes out of the bush. Especially in lieu of these recent LRA ne- gotiations the confl ict seems to be at a tip- ping point. At such an important juncture, what does the international community need to know? It\u2019s not really about what the international community should know, but rather what they should do to support this process. The have them apologise publicly. This should be done by the traditional leadership, and they would determine the punishment. This kind of traditional justice system is not like the typical Western system where a convicted criminal is locked away forever. People want to see you back in society. In Africa, people want criminals to admit pub- licly what they did and what their motiva- tions were. They want to hear you say sorry. The community gives criminals their pun- ishment; for example, one can be banished for a certain number of years. Alternatively a criminal might have a cleansing ceremony and he or she is responsible for providing all that is needed. People want to see your con- tribution to the community, and they want to engage and use your expertise and ex- perience \u2014 no matter what you have done. They do not want to see you locked away where you are not seen or heard from again. In Africa, our justice system is restorative. Despite the fact that someone has commit- ted atrocities, at some point in our coexist- ence we need each other. With the looming ICC indictments, does Kony have a reason to leave the bush? Kony cannot leave and instead he is say- ing, \u2018come and get me\u2019. Recently one of the other LRA commanders whose name is not on the ICC indictment list, Opiyo Makasi, surrendered after Kony arrested his dep- uty commander.

We also met the leadership of the Moro National Lib- eration Front (MNLF) and had a series of consultations with them. Equally important was meeting with the Department of For- eign Affairs in Mindanao and fi nding out how would they see a group of internationals coming in and making an intervention. At the same time we continually consulted with other leading activists in that area. We soon realised that no internationals stay and work at the grassroots level doing the kind of work NP does. First of all be- cause of security reasons and second because it\u2019s not easy to maintain a relationship with the local civil society. Civil society is very demanding; they\u2019re very experienced. They wanted expertise from NP and they wanted us to bring an international team of well- trained civilian peacekeepers who could work hand in hand with local peacekeepers. Civil society wanted us as international ac- tors, who are the eyes and ears of the inter- national community, to be there. They also wanted NP to help build the capacities of local peacekeepers. Finally, they wanted us to link local civil society with the key organisations at the national and international levels working for peace. These are also three key areas where NP thought we could play a pivotal role. in areas only where we have an invitation. We then sent an exploration team to the Philippines in 2005 and conducted focus groups especially in the fi eld locations. The NP mandate is specifi cally in peace- keeping; we don\u2019t do any development or other kind of work. In the fi rst assessment we didn\u2019t get the right kind of \u2018results\u2019 and thought perhaps we were not very much needed. At the same time the local civil so- ciety were persistent in asking us to set up a programme. The next step was to send two NP people for three months in Mindanao. Before, this kind of work was done by local people on behalf of NP. In this case we decided to do our own assessments on the ground as to whether we were really needed or not. We checked whether other organisations were doing a similar kind of thing and if it was working or not. Two people were sent; one was myself and the other someone else who had also worked with NP in Sri Lanka. We already had some kind of understanding about the NP mandate; the way we make interventions and how we assess the project realities. First, we identifi ed the key civil society actors who were playing a proactive role in terms of contributing toward sustainable peace. They helped us to identify six or seven dif- ferent platforms where the confl ict started \u2014 the real hotbeds. Mindanao, home to a majority of the coun- try\u2019s Muslims, is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 in the last three decades. Confl ict in Mindinao, the easternmost island in the Philippines, has been largely concentrated in the Muslim- majority areas of central and south-western parts of the island. Clashes have been partly characterised by resistance to central govern- ment control and resentment of an increasing number of Christian settlers. Several armed rebel factions are operational, including the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Abu Sayyaf and the New People\u2019s Army. Although religious differences have partly shaped the confl ict, the roots of the confl ict have been clashes of interest in land and other natural resources, and the identity issues emerging from the secondclass status of much of the Moro, or Muslim, population. Can you tell me about how Nonviolent Peaceforce (NP) established a programme in the Philippines and what steps were involved to deploy a team on the ground? Local civil society in Mindanao felt it needed a non-violent intervention to strengthen its efforts and the overall peace process, especially on the ground level. On that basis they extended an invitation to Nonviolent Peaceforce. As always, we work Atif Hameed is the project director of the Nonviolent Peaceforce (NP) project in the Philippines, which is based in the heart of the confl ict in Mindanao. He also served on the team of civilian peacekeepers in the NP pilot project in Sri Lanka. In both cases he and his fi eld team members carry out the mission of accompanying civil society activists, provide protective presence to vulnerable groups and communities and monitor ceasefi re agreements.

We work in such locations to directly contribute toward the maintenance of peace and to link these isolated areas to the rest of \u2018mainstream Mindanao\u2019. If the links are there \u2014 and if there is peace \u2014 then more internationals will go and there will be development in- come generated. NP doesn\u2019t do anything in development directly, but we want to link these isolated areas up. From there we contacted the Department of National Defence and the Department of National Security, and we met all the army generals and chief commanders of all the rebel groups. You need to get permission from everybody to ensure your own safe- ty and security and to be more effective. It\u2019s also a way to ensure our own non- partisanship. NP was in Mindanao for those initial three months working with the community, which was a way of securing our legitima- cy. It was important for the communities to know why we were there and that we really wanted to be there. During the assessment period there were confl icts in the area and because of the presence of our team the level of the confl ict was minimal. How do confl icts typically start? Sometimes confl ict starts because of ru- mours. For example, there was a case where one of the rebel groups was getting very close to the buffer zone. The rebels were actually going there to have an internal meeting. However, the Armed Forces of the How is the confl ict in Mindanao char- acterised and what can a team of interna- tional civilian peacekeepers bring? In Mindanao there are so many cycles of war. It\u2019s not like there is violent confl ict all over the place all the time. Confl ict will happen all of a sudden in this or that loca- tion. Last year there were two \u2018mini-wars\u2019. Institutional donors were interested in NP because no one else was doing this kind of work, and it was helpful to have people who could effectively ensure safety and security at the fl ash points. Initially our team was to be made up of six or seven international civilian peace- keepers deployed in two areas around Mindanao. We decided not to have our head offi ce in the capital, Manila. Most internationals operating in the Philippines are based in the capital. We decided to put up our head offi ce in the heart of the con- fl ict, which is the city of Cotabato. Then we set up two fi eld sites around central Mindanao. The situation on the ground is troubling. In one year people are sometimes displaced 12 to 14 times. There are many factional fi ghts, sometimes involving rebel groups and sometimes paramilitaries. People are really on the move. The other location we identifi ed is in Sulu Province. This is in an area famous for Abu Sayyaf, which is associated with Al Qaeda. There are a lot of Philippine Army soldiers and US Marines in that area, and it is also the base of the MNLF. We decided to put up an offi ce there because it is so On this basis we formulated a proposal and submitted it to the Nonviolent Peace- force international programme committee. They gave us the green light to go ahead with the Philippines project. But of course you cannot go ahead with a project without fi nancial support, and it took a lot of effort to secure funds. We contacted all donors who were funding some kind of work in Mindanao. When about 65 per cent of the total funds needed had been gathered we decided to go ahead with the project. Our partners wanted us there immediately. Concretely, what kinds of activities do you engage in the fi eld? Often we are involved in what is called \u2018protective accompaniment\u2019 when, for ex- ample, families are threatened. We come and we bring a presence. Occasionally we engage in something called \u2018inter-position- ing\u2019: if the chances for confl ict look high, we put ourselves there in the middle. We would only engage in this in areas where NP is recognised by all sides \u2014 namely, where we have fi eld sites. We engage in early warning and early response so local people can come to re- ally believe in peace and dialogue. They are more likely to do so when they have a support structure and they do not feel alone. As far as early warning, we do a daily assessment where we analyse dif- ferent indicators. Ideally, I would like the team be between 25 and 29 people. Then I think we could really be a \u2018third force\u2019 in the peace process. ",

Many were killed, and the government re- settled many from the north of the country in the region. Local people can only have 14 hectares of land while outsiders [set- tlers] can have 24 hectares. Peace talks are continually held up be- cause of issues related to territory, gov- ernance and natural resources. The MNLF signed a peace agreement in 1996 that cre- ated the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Since then billions of dollars have been spent, but the confl ict continues. Bridges are being built, but communities have no food to eat. In 1996 they achieved autonomy, but the reality of the agreement has had no im- pact. There are more paramilitaries in the equation. Back then there were two; now there are six. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough: we can- not talk about development; we need to talk about security. I hear people say, \u2018We don\u2019t want noodles, we don\u2019t want sardines \u2014 we want security\u2019. Actually, the cycle of violence revolves around the growing sea- son. When the crops are ready, that\u2019s when the AFP attacks. The people say the armed forces cultivate the fruits and send them off to the capital city, Manila. If you ignore the people, new actors en- ter in and play a part in violence. When people feel involved in the process, though, they are more likely to stick to peace agreements. People are often involved in cal people and have them comment on our goals. This helps to share each others\u2019 work, as what we\u2019re really doing is creating a network of networks. Not just in your work, but also living in a confl ict zone, how diffi cult is it to stay non-partisan? It\u2019s extremely difficult. There are so many groups and stakeholders. You have the MILF, the MNLF, Abu Sayyaf, the AFP, the US Marines and civil society. We have regular communication with each in some way. If you have one intervention with an affected group of Christians, for example, you also have to have one in a Muslim community. Otherwise you can be accused of favouritism or taking sides. It really helps to have a multi-religious team as well. On our team currently we are two Buddhists, two Christians and two Muslims. We also aim for a gender balance. Since 1917, more than 165,000 people have been killed in this confl ict and mil- lions have been displaced. About 60 per cent of the population of Mindanao are IDPs (internally displaced persons). But ac- cording to national law, if you leave an area and are present somewhere else for six months, you lose IDP status. But of course you can\u2019t go back to where you came from because someone else is living where you were. Mindanao is sometimes called \u2018the land of promise\u2019 because it is so rich in every- thing in terms of natural resources. The people there say you don\u2019t even have to Philippines (AFP) thought maybe they were planning to attack the checkpoint near the buffer zone, so the AFP also moved their troops close to that location. Normally both parties are supposed to maintain a distance around the zone of about 2-3 km, but at that point it was reduced to 300 m. Meanwhile the communities thought there would be an attack, so hundreds of families started evacuating. We got the news quickly. Immediately we got in touch with the commanders at the ground lev- el and told them that the rebels said they didn\u2019t have any plans to attack but were having an internal meeting. And on the other side we told the rebels we had had contact with the AFP and that they were thinking there was going to be an attack. This goes to show that passing information at the right moment really helps a lot. It also reinforces that as an organisation you cannot go to a place for a short time. Stay there. If you move out it makes the people feel more vulnerable. In such situations only one gunshot is needed. After that fi rst gunshot you then see rockets and shells everywhere. Our presence has avoided many confl icts, and this is a great example of early response. There is often a lot of talk about Track I and Track II mediation, but you hear very little about Track III \u2014 the grassroots. This is really key. The NP operational structure is simply \u2018do no harm\u2019. All NP interventions at all levels have regular checks at each fi eld site. We want to hear directly from the lo- ",

S WORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES \u2014 DISARMAMENT , DEMOBILISATION AND REINTEGRATION IN Z IMBABWE , N AMIBIA AND S OUTH A FRICA 1 Introduction In the past three decades Zimbabwe, Na- mibia and South Africa implemented the disarmament, demobilisation and reinte- gration (DDR) of redundant combatants as part of war to peace transitions. Successful DDR is seen as a sine qua non for long-term peace and stability. The immediate goal of the process is to restore security and stabil- ity through the responsible management of weapons of combatants. The gradual goal is to enable former combatants to become productive members of their local communi- ties. DDR thus has the potential to facilitate security and development by ensuring the human security of ex-combatants through their long-term sustainable reintegration in secure post-confl ict frameworks. The United Nations was deliberate- ly excluded from playing a pivotal role in Zimbabwe\u2019s independence process. Britain, the former colonial power, desired to exclu- sively control and infl uence a short transi- tional period that would not include a bur- densome post-confl ict peacebuilding role. 2 Following the Lancaster House Agreement on Rhodesia of 21 December 1979, a small British-led Commonwealth team supervised Zimbabwe\u2019s ceasefi re monitoring and transi- tional elections leading to genuine majority rule and legal independence. The post-inde- pendence regime tackled the integration of a new army amidst DDR. Namibia experienced UN-managed disarmament and demobilisa- tion. In 1989\u201390, Namibia was host to the multidimensional UN Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG), which successfully super- vised the country\u2019s transition to independ- ence. UNTAG\u2019s mandate was specifi cally on the disarmament and demobilisation of all armed groups. Following UNTAG\u2019s exit, the independence government established a new and professional military while having to formulate a reintegration policy. In South Africa DDR was internally activated, local- ly owned and state managed. It was close- ly linked to the high priority establishment of the new South African National Defence Force (SANDF). This paper reviews the country-specifi c DDR processes and the outcomes in Zim- babwe, Namibia and South Africa. It does so in four sections. The fi rst three deal with the three countries on an individual case basis. The concluding section then draws some practical policy recommendations and food for thought for enhancing future DDR efforts. Zimbabwean case study Background Zimbabwe\u2019s DDR was formulated and implemented after the end of a protracted, widespread and bitter liberation war, or Sec- ond Chimurenga. The 1960s and 1970s lib- eration war pitted the military wings of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU), 3 ZANLA and ZIPRA, respectively, against the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF). In October 1976, ZANU and ZAPU merged into the short-lived loose Patriotic Front (PF) tactical alliance in a bid to wage a unifi ed military strategy against the RSF via the Zimbabwe Peoples Army (ZIPA). However, just as a mutual inter-force hostility ex- isted between the PF and RSF, intra-force hostility existed within the liberation ar- mies\u2019 alliance. 4 Zimbabwe\u2019s experience of a 1 This article has prior been published by ISS, Pretoria 2 See S.

ZANU was formed as a splinter group from ZAPU in 1963 under the leadership of the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole. ZANU established ZANLA in 1964 and ZAPU established ZIPRA in 1965 as their military wings to wage a liberation war against the Rhodesian Government. 4 Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation war movement had competing ethnic, ideological and strategic components. ZANLA was mainly Shona while ZIPRA was mainly Ndebele in composition. ZANLA\u2019s liberation war strategy was Chinese-infl uenced and relied on mass mobilisation to sustain a protracted liberation struggle. ZIPRA\u2019s strategy was Soviet-oriented and placed emphasis on conventional warfare strategy. ",

Since the Lancaster House Agreement did not provide the legal frame- work for the process, Zimbabwe\u2019s post-inde- pendence government implemented practi- cal DDR alongside the military integration of the three former warring parties, namely the RSF, ZANLA (Zimbabwe African Na- tional Liberation Army) and ZIPRA (Zim- babwe Peoples Revolutionary Army), into a national army. Pre-integration disarmament and demobilisation Prior to the integration of the three forces, some units of the RSF, including the Selous Scouts, Guard Force, and Muzorewa\u2019s Aux- iliary Forces, were disbanded. These units were not eligible for wholesale integration, as they had been established for specifi c counter-liberation purposes and were not intended to be permanent forces. 8 Moreo- ver, these units were associated with atroci- ties during the war and had become wholly political during the negotiations; reminis- cent of the Koevoet in Namibia. Many RSF members also withdrew from the forces prior to the integration process. RSF conscripts simply opted out and returned to their pre- enlisting employment. Regular RSF mem- bers also took advantage of the Inducement Scheme that provided for the upgrading of offi cers by one rank on retirement for threatening to withdraw bases for the PF, given savage punitive RSF raids on guer- rilla sanctuaries and general infrastructure in these neighbouring countries. The possi- bility of Britain legitimising the incumbent Muzorewa-led Rhodesian coalition govern- ment, the \u2018second-class solution\u2019 in the event of a PF pull-out from the negotiations, also permanently hung over the peace confer- ence. In addition, the PF predicted electoral victory that would enable them to preside over the post-independence integration and DDR processes. The elite\u2019s concurrence to the Lancaster House Agreement, that skirted DDR and the post-independence status and recompense of PF forces, did not fi nd favour among the common combatants. The Lancaster House Agreement, effected through a ceasefi re agreement between the RSF and PF forces, and enforced from mid- night on 21 December 1979, provided for a demilitarisation process by means of the separation and containment of the liberation combatants in designated Assembly Points (APs), and of the RSF in their established bases. The Ceasefi re Commission (CFC) and a modest Commonwealth Monitoring Force (CMF) provided the institutional framework for the implementation of the Agreement. Operational defi ciencies and organisational fl aws did not impede Zimbabwe\u2019s success- long and brutal armed liberation struggle, in which two fully-fl edged guerrilla armies (ZANLA and ZIPRA) actively engaged the RSF against a background of mutual hos- tility and suspicion, called for a complex post-liberation war DDR process. Lancaster House Agreement and DDR: Ending the war at the cost of long-term stability? The Lancaster House Agreement \u2014 a \u2018largely pre-conceived British settlement plan\u2019 5 \u2014 that was not specifi c on integration and DDR, ended the war. Integration and DDR were neither sticks nor carrots in the peace negotiations and agreement, despite attempts to have these issues discussed. 6 The British/Commonwealth mediators, pre- occupied with expediently ending the war, conveniently sidestepped these issues, ar- guing that this would be the responsibility of the elected government. This played into the hands of the RSF commanders who had predicated their participation in the Lancas- ter talks on the maintenance of the military status quo prior to elections. While envisaging their military victory, albeit at an enormous human and mate- rial cost, the PF were pressured into signing the Lancaster House Agreement. 7 Mozam- bique and Zambia had issued ultimatums 5 NAN A.636/2, E.

An estimated 10,000 civilians lost their lives and thou- sands more were harmed during the 5 th Bri- gade\u2019s campaign, as violence and insecu- rity rocked Matabeleland and parts of the Midlands until the signing of the historic Unity Accord of 1987 by ZANU and ZAPU. This dealt a major blow to post-independ- ence peace, and to nation building and reconstruction. Zimbabwe\u2019s security policy framework shifted, as it also had to strengthen its de- fences against apartheid South Africa\u2019s \u2018Total National Strategy\u2019 against those southern African states that were inclined to Marxism and supportive of African liber- ation and ANC operatives. The total strategy was in part prescribed the military equipping of the RENAMO surrogate forces, as well as some dissident elements that launched in- cursions into Zimbabwe. Information that came to light during the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission revealed the South African Defence Force\u2019s involvement catastrophic, as ZANU\u2014ZAPU ethnic-based tensions spilled over from the liberation war. The passage of time did not heal the wounds, distrust and tension between ZANU and ZAPU; this played out against a back- drop of incomprehensive Ndebele\u2014Shona reconciliation. Apartheid South Africa, the major economic, political and military force in the region exploited these mutual hostili- ties to further entrench the wedge between the two parties. The insecurity threats posed by the reten- tion of weapons materialised in the eventual clashes in the APs between the ZANLA and ZIPRA combatants. Following the promi- nent Entumbane clash of 9-11 November 1980, the government disarmed the guer- rillas. Perceiving disarmament as dispa- rate, and designed to buttress the political and military power of the Shona, \u2018many ZIPRA guerrillas left the armed forces and the camps, joining the ranks of those armed members of the lumpen elements who could be a reservoir of future destabilisation\u2019. 10 These mutinies were spontaneous and were not part of ZAPU policy. 11 However, Zim- babwe experienced armed dissident activ- ity in Matabeleland and parts of the Mid- lands 1981-1987, during which some former ZIPRA combatants took up arms against the government. pension purposes. The war-disabled ex-RSF could also claim compensation in terms of a Rhodesian Act of Parliament. In addition to the disbandment process, PF combatants who were in the Assembly Points, and were unfi t or unwilling to en- list in the military forces, were demobilised. While these combatants were given ques- tionnaires in the APs to compile their pro- fi les and preferred post-war occupations, no elaborate reintegration policy was de- signed, besides the provision of a demobili- sation grant of Z $400. The opportunity to plan a comprehensive DDR strategy at the earliest possible stage was lost. The limited monetary reintegration strategy resulted in the ineffective reintegration of these demo- bilised combatants, the majority of whom re-registered under the Demobilisation Pro- gramme of 1981. As the Lancaster House Agreement had failed to provide for practical disarmament, Robert Mugabe, then Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, outlined the govern- ment\u2019s policy of disarming combatants as they demobilised, while those awaiting in- tegration would retain their weapons. 9 The retention of weapons by ex-combatants dur- ing the long idle months spent in APs await- ing integration and demobilisation proved 9 Ibid. 10 H.

This was an enforced antithesis to demilitarisation. 15 The resultant increase of the army by 10,000 to 51,519 16 was ac- companied by constant and substantial de- fence expenditure. 17 The relegation of DDR meant that the envisaged peace dividend, which should have been characterised by the release of resources for social and eco- nomically productive projects, remained elusive. Demobilisation policy of 1981-1983: demobilise and scatter? The integration process resulted in a new army of about 70,000 members, against an initial projected target of 30,000. Fiscal and security objectives underpinned the govern- ment\u2019s policy decision to plan and imple- ment demobilisation of the over-manned army. The government set up the Demo- bilisation Directorate in July 1981, appro- priately under the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, to implement demobilisa- tion and reintegration with relevant sister ministries. 14 For more, see D.

The relationship between the ruling ZANU PF and the war veterans has consistently been characterised by \u2018power- seeking agendas, their appeals to the revo- lutionary liberation, their use of violence and intimidation,\u2019 and their \u2018simultaneous confl ict and collaboration as party and vet- erans manipulate one another\u2019. 24 The costs of this programme including an initial out- lay of more than Z $4.5 billion on gratui- ties and lifetime pensions for over 52,000 nomic, social and political confi guration. 21 Despite these obvious programmatic limitations the Zimbabwean Government stressed that \u2018those (ex-combatants) who had not furthered their education or gained some skills or training, or were unemployed, would be on their own after the (demobili- sation) payments expired\u2019. 22 By 1990 up to 25,000 ex-combatants were unemployed, as indicators of human insecurity dominat- ed their livelihoods. Since the government did not initiate further reintegration assist- ance beyond the ill-fated 1981 program, ex-combatants perceived this as offi cial in- difference to their plight. Instead of turn- ing ex-combatants into productive civilians, (ineffective) DDR transformed them into war veterans, an identity they would later vio- lently mobilise to achieve varied aims. The Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA), established after the Unity Accord of 1987 between ZANU and ZAPU, offered the ex-combatants the plat- form to launch their demands. The groundswell of discontent, and the threat to national stability posed by inef- fectively reintegrated and disgruntled ex- combatants, exploded in 1997. This followed the Zimbabwean government\u2019s suspension of the War Victims Compensation Fund (es- identifi cation documents authorising them to withdraw the demobilisation allowance from bank outlets countrywide. At the end of the physical demobilisation exercise in June 1983, 35,763 combatants had been demobilised. (See Table 1.) Notwithstanding the existence of a dedi- cated Demobilisation Directorate, there were programmatic and institutional gaps. These included the lack of a broad and consistent socio-economic profi ling of combatants, the failure to implement fi nancial management skills training for the many ex-combatants inexperienced in handling (demobilisation) money, incompetent and corrupt directorate staff, an absence of elaborate and workable business or cooperatives support mecha- nisms, and the lack of a proactive moni- toring mechanism. The majority of the ex- combatant enterprises collapsed due to these factors, while agro-based enterprises were also hard-hit by drought. The ex-combatants had been \u2018thrown into a sophisticated world without adequate preparation\u2019. 20 Compound- ed by unfavourable post-independence eco- nomic, social, and politico-military frame- works, the DDR process disintegrated. This translated to the absence of a dedicated re- integration policy by government, impacting profoundly on the independent state\u2019s eco- 20 PARADE, April 1990. 21 G. Mazarire and M. R.

On the day on which the ceasefi re was to come into effect, 1 April 1989, South African forces clashed with PLAN combat- ants who had crossed the border from Angola into northern Namibia. UNTAG has since confi rmed PLAN\u2019s explanation that it had been engaged in establishing military bases inside Namibia that would be monitored by UNTAG, only to be ambushed by South Af- rican forces. However, at the time, South African forces, authorised by the UN to de- ploy and enforce the ceasefi re, engaged in a major onslaught against the outnumbered and less well-equipped PLAN combatants, in which more than 375 PLAN combatants were killed. 26 UNTAG\u2019s operational and lo- gistic capacity was expeditiously boosted to enable it to credibly carry out its mandate. The parties\u2019 ultimate commitment to the in- dependence process and amenability to UN- TAG pressure facilitated signifi cant disarma- ment and demobilisation. UNTAG subsequently demobilised the SWATF and the citizen commando forces. The arms, military equipment and ammuni- tion collected from these units were depos- ited in \u2018double-locked\u2019 drill halls guarded by UNTAG infantry. 27 However, South Africa\u2019s attempt to maintain its tactical presence in Namibia\u2019s security sector, and SWAPO\u2019s al- leged retention of a strategic reserve force threatened to blot disarmament and demo- UNTAG and DDR The New York Accords of 28 December 1988 (signed by Angola, Cuba and South Africa) facilitated the implementation of Na- mibia\u2019s independence plan as outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 435 (1978). Disarmament and demobilisation were part of the Settlement Plan and were concretely enshrined in the mandate of the United Na- tions Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). UNTAG\u2019s tasks included: (cid:129) monitoring the ceasefi re; (cid:129) ensuring that troops (both SADF and SWAPO) were confi ned to bases; and (cid:129) supervising the rapid reduction and even- tual removal of South African military forces from Namibia. 25 Resolution 435 also provided for the dis- bandment of all \u2018ethnic and paramilitary\u2019 units that had been established by colonial South Africa. Disarmament and demobilisa- tion were thus incorporated into the overall strategy to create secure conditions for Na- mibia\u2019s transition to independence. As UN- TAG did not have a post-confl ict mandate to assist with the reintegration of the demobi- lised combatants, this was left to the devices of the independence government. UNTAG\u2019s implementation of disarmament and demobilisation was marked by an in- auspicious start. The delay in the full em- placement of UNTAG in Namibia had seri- war veterans and the negative impact on the country\u2019s broader economy meant that Zimbabwe did not experience the fi nancial dividend of DDR. To date the government is burdened with war veterans\u2019 pensions, which constantly have to be adjusted to keep pace with rampant hyper-infl ation. Namibian case study Background Namibia\u2019s liberation war mainly pitted SWAPO\u2019s military wing; the People\u2019s Liber- ation Army of Namibia (PLAN) against the SADF from August 1966-1989. This meant that Namibia\u2019s DDR would involve one lib- eration army. The SADF, whose presence in Namibia was declared illegal by the UN, was an external army that could be easily withdrawn from Namibia in the post-war era. South Africa established indigenous forces to fi ght against PLAN alongside the SADF, such as the South West Africa Terri- torial Force (SWATF), and citizen and com- mando forces. The San, also disparagingly known as the Bushmen, whose tracking and hunting skills were considered invalu- able in the bush war against SWAPO, were recruited as SWATF soldiers. South Africa also trained the counter-insurgency unit Koevoet (\u2018crowbar\u2019), which terrorised Na- mibians. These forces had to be included alongside PLAN combatants in the proc- ess to establish Namibia\u2019s national armed forces and DDR programmes. 25 United Nations (1996).

Prioritising the powerful political imperatives of na- tional reconciliation and nation building, the Namibian government embarked on stop- gap reintegration measures for the superfl u- ous ex-fi ghters. Ex-SWATF members were better placed than their ex-PLAN counterparts. For in- stance, SWATF ex-fi ghters continued to re- ceive salaries from South Africa after dis- charge, until Namibia\u2019s independence. This was meant to facilitate their reintegration into civilian life, and to retain their loyalty to the SADF in case Namibia\u2019s transition to independence collapsed. 31 In 1991-1992 South Africa implemented a compensation scheme comprising \u2018a once-off payment of 12,000 Namibian dollars (US $2,600) to former Koevoet and SWATF forces as a gra- tuity to tide them over until they found em- ployment\u2019. 32 In any event, their possession of the standard 8 level of education entry requirement stood them in good stead for civilian employment and reintegration. The same cannot be said of the ex- PLAN fi ghters, whose employment pros- pects were restricted by their lack of formal qualifi cations. The majority, unable to be absorbed into limied public sector employment, remained a part of the mainstream unem- of a slow start, more than 5,000 were ulti- mately confi ned to bases in Angola. 28 The in- itial diffi culties can probably be attributed to the dispersal of PLAN fi ghters, following the clashes of April 1989, 29 and the intimidat- ing visible presence of South African forc- es outside their bases. UNTAG\u2019s small team of 31 military monitors, based in Lubango, Angola, and known as UNTAG A (Angola), supervised the disarmament of PLAN by the Angolan military and their confi nement to Angolan camps. Angolan General Ndalu later asserted that all SWAPO personnel re- treated north of the 16 th parallel. 30 Creating a time bomb? Post-independence reintegration The success of the two \u2018Ds\u2019 in DDR was undermined by the independence govern- ment\u2019s failure to plan and implement com- prehensive reintegration programmes. Na- mibia had no constitutionally established defence force at independence. One of the priorities of the new government was the formation of an integrated Namibian De- fence Force (NDF) against a backdrop of mistrust and suspicion. The successfully established NDF and the transformed Na- mibian Police combined absorbed between 8,000 and 10,000 combatants, offering them and their dependants some stability. How- ever, this accounted for but a fraction of the bilisation. For instance, the majority of the SWATF retained their camoufl age, main- tained contact with their \u2018former\u2019 command- ers, and remained on the payroll. In addi- tion, instead of disbanding the paramilitary Koevoet unit in line with UN recommenda- tions, South Africa \u2018infi ltrated\u2019 about 2,000 of its original 3,000 members into SWAPOL, thereby bypassing the demobilisation pro- visions. These \u2018demobilised\u2019 personnel were responsible for widespread intimidation and destabilisation activity, including hunting down and eliminating PLAN combatants and threatening the masses, particularly in the sensitive and populous northern areas. Under pressure from UNTAG, South Afri- can administrators eventually agreed to the demobilisation of 1,600 ex-Koevoet mem- bers of SWAPOL under UNTAG supervi- sion by 30 October 1989. The remaining 1,500-strong \u2018Merlyn Force\u2019 was withdrawn after the certifi cation of the elections on 21 November 1989, completing the with- drawal of the SADF and its concomitant military equipment. Disarmament of PLAN was carried out in Angola. PLAN troops who had been in Na- mibia on 1 April 1989 were assembled at designated camps before being escorted un- der UNTAG supervision to assembly points north of the 16th parallel in Angola.

In- stead of mollifying the disgruntled and ri- otous former combatants in the short term with monetary pay-offs, the Peace Project enhanced prospects of the long-term reinte- gration of its benefi ciaries. Instructively, the Peace Project has for seven years managed to prevent new security threats posed by the ex-fi ghters. South African case study Background South Africa\u2019s violent anti-apartheid con- fl ict involved seven major armed antago- nists. The apartheid security forces were the SADF and the armed forces of the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei (TBVC) homelands. The liberation movements, the African National Congress (ANC) and Pan African Congress (PAC), established their re- spective military wings; Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army (APLA). The involvement of varied armed formations in South Africa\u2019s anti- apartheid struggle meant that the country had a heterogeneous, ex-fi ghter population to deal with under its DDR process. How- ever, a major feature of the anti-apartheid confl ict was that there were limited military ex-combatants who are not treated as a spe- cifi c preferential target group under the na- tional land reform programme. About 3,800 mainly white farmers continued to own 44 per cent of arable land. 34 Other institutional and operational prob- lems, including a lack of funding, a lack of technical expertise and qualifi ed personnel, as well as inappropriate training, resulted in the Development Brigade programme failing to acquire self-suffi ciency status and wean the trainees into productive employment or viable projects. Bilateral donors such as the Swedish International Development Coop- eration Agency (SIDA) and later the Euro- pean Community withdrew sponsorship on the basis of negative evaluation reports on the performance and viability of the Devel- opment Brigade. Namibia\u2019s initiatives broadly failed to fa- cilitate ex-fi ghter reintegration. This pre- sented a potential threat to national sta- bility and security. The public disruption and rioting by ineffectively reintegrated and disenchanted former fi ghters in the mid- 1990s demonstrated this. 35 In a gratifying response to avert full-scale instability, the government decided to implement the aptly named Peace Project, aimed at affi rmative job placements, mainly in the public service, ployed population years into independence. This was at a time when the transition to independence was accompanied by a neo- colonial economic structure and a small pri- vate sector that was not immediately re- structured to facilitate economic growth and job creation. The government also did not develop the potential of the informal sector to meet the reintegration goals of creating jobs and alleviating poverty among unat- tached ex-fi ghters. Former PLAN combatants were each paid a nominal once-off gratuity of 1,400 rand in 1991. 33 The intention was that this gratu- ity would be complemented by the succeed- ing two-year (1991 and 1992) Development Brigade (later Development Brigade Cor- poration) training programme, designed to impart practical agricultural and construc- tion skills suffi cient for sustainable post- graduation income generation to the un- employed ex-combatants, but which did not quite work out as planned. The Development Brigade was strategically placed under the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and Reha- bilitation (MLLR), as land reform was to be central to its success. However, Namibia\u2019s slow and cumbersome land resettlement pro- gramme has resulted in the perpetuation of skewed land ownership patterns. Access to land has been problematic, in particular for 33 This followed demonstrations by ex-fi ghters in Windhoek, who demanded recompense for their liberation war efforts.

The provisions of the Malan Accord included the control over the cadres and arms of MK, which had been in- creasingly infi ltrated into the country. One of the results of the Accord was the regis- tration and legalisation of specifi c MK fi re- arms after the ANC \u2018raised concerns about the need to protect our leadership\u2019, and \u2018this was one of the processes that helped in the disarmament process'. 38 In addition, a facilitative Government Gazette of March 1991 authorised automatic indemnity for MK members who received military training and engaged in armed military activities up to 8 October 1990. 39 A result of the above initiatives was the disarmament of some 4,000 MK fi ghters, and their return to South Africa from camps in Uganda and Tanzania as \u2018unarmed ci- vilians\u2019 during the UNHCR voluntary re- patriation operation. 40 Interviews with MK ex-fi ghters confi rmed this. Disarmament and repatriation under the UNCHR was not elaborately linked to ex-fi ghter reintegra- tion. The repatriated fi ghters received lim- ited rehabilitation assistance, provided for under the repatriation process. The weapons collected \u2018went back to the headquarters of the liberation move- defence forces. Whereas the formation of the SANDF was structured and well thought out, \u2018the demobilisation of former APLA and MK soldiers was an afterthought\u2019. 37 Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration: the process and the impacts Against a backdrop of signifi cant meet- ings between the apartheid government and the un-banned ANC, the ANC suspended its armed struggle in August 1990. This was un- der the framework of the Pretoria Minute of 6 August 1990, which reaffi rmed both par- ties\u2019 commitment to \u2018moving as speedily as possible towards a negotiated peaceful po- litical settlement\u2019 By agreeing that \u2018no fur- ther armed actions and related activities by the ANC and its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [MK] will take place\u2019, the nationalist movement ostensibly opened the opportu- nity for self-managed disarmament. The Pre- toria Minute, however, did not end mistrust, competition and military machinations. The ensuing volatile political and security frame- work constrained disarmament efforts. Against this unstable backdrop the South African Government and the ANC signed the D.F. Malan Accord of February 1991. The Accord reiterated the parties\u2019 commit- ment to the upholding of the most pertinent engagements between the larger and so- phisticated SADF and the liberation armies inside South Africa. Jacklyn Cock described South Africa\u2019s confl ict as a \u2018low-level civil war\u2019. 36 The fact that armed confl ict was low- key may inadvertently have resulted in the low emphasis on the planning and execu- tion of DDR. The settlement of South Africa\u2019s violent confl ict was concluded in a series of minutes and accords. These included the Groote Sch- uur Minute, Pretoria Minute, National Peace Accord and CODESA Declaration. The Multi- Party Negotiating Forum with the National Party Government and ANC elite as major players recommended the creation of an in- ternal Transitional Executive Council (TEC) to supervise South Africa\u2019s transition to democ- racy. A Sub-Council on Defence (SCD) was established as part of the TEC to implement the military aspects of the transition. The multi-party negotiations emphasized the es- tablishment of a new, unitary SANDF. While this was important as part of a broader strat- egy to ensure control of the levers of the new state in an uncertain political environment, the plan of an essential and comprehensive DDR gave way. For instance, the SCD\u2019s ma- jor tasks included ensuring compliance by all armed forces with the objectives of the TEC, and research and planning for the new 36 J.

As demobilisation had started in 1995 after the democratic elections, this had to work retrospectively. The demobi- lised were supposed to be catered for by a three-legged demobilisation and reintegra- tion strategy: (cid:129) a gratuity payment, calculated according to length of service in the liberation ar- mies, and at scales approved by Cabinet, with sums in excess of 30,000 rand; sub- ject to normal taxation; (cid:129) counselling and advisory services to guide the ex-fi ghters on how to man- age their gratuities, as well as to advise on the options available to support their reintegration; (cid:129) a skills upgrade via the Service Corps training scheme. Africa\u2019s multi-causal and destructive small arms scourge. For example, fi rearms are said to \u2018feature prominently in violent crime and contribute directly to the distinctively high murder rate in SA\u2019. 45 South African Police Services (SAPS) Deputy Provincial Commis- sioner Africa Khumalo, a former MK com- mander in charge of disarmament, noted: \u2018Finally, not all fi rearms were collected. Some of them we have found in the cash- in transit robberies. Thus (until) today, the government is still giving amnesties with regards to handing in of illegal fi rearms'. 46 Demobilisation was secondary to the es- tablishment of the SANDF. It was imple- mented on the basis of a cabinet decision of 16 August 1995, as an exit strategy for personnel listed on the liberation armies\u2019 Certifi ed Personnel Registers (CPR) but in- eligible or disinclined to join the SANDF. In 1995 the then Minister of Defence, now late, Joe Modise, announced the demobilisation process as involving the voluntary release of members of the former liberation armies (referred to as Non-Statutory Forces), who, despite being constitutionally part of the SANDF, did not wish to serve in the full- time force or who could not do so due to age, ill health or did not meet the minimum ments because there were some form of records on the movements\u2019 weapons and which units were given what. They may not have returned all but people returned their weapons'. 41 The liberation movements then handed over these weapons to the Transi- tional Executive Council, established by the multiparty negotiations to deal with mili- tary aspects of the transition, and they were supposed to be destroyed. 42 Further attempts at disarmament includ- ed a July 1993 month-long amnesty pe- riod, during which people could hand over weapons and be immune from prosecu- tion. However, in a statement that could be strongly construed to imply the retention of weapons by ANC cadres, ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said, \u2018The ANC will never hand over weapons to this illegal govern- ment'. 43 Notably, only three days before the amnesty ended, only 18 weapons had been handed in. 44 However, South African police spokesman Captain Louis le Roux attributed the poor response to the possession of arms by criminals who feared to be linked with other arms. Disarmament was not in any way com- plete.

        "[ 267 ] The fact that the demobilisation and re- integration process lacked clear monitoring and follow-up mechanisms meant that no corrective measures were designed to assist ex-fi ghters who had failed to reintegrate. This created a potentially disruptive sense of neglect, betrayal and marginalisation among the ex-combatants. The threats to security and stability posed by ineffectively reinte- grated ex-fi ghters became a reality in the form of armed criminal activities, mainly cash-in-transit heists. 52 Small-scale protests by ex-fi ghters 53 were held, largely \u2018motivat- ed by the needs of the individuals concerned to highlight their grievances\u2019. 54 The government has since enacted the Military Veterans Affairs Act of 1999 as part The absence of a timely and comprehen- sive DDR strategy was aggravated by the post-apartheid economic context, character- ised by \u2018jobless growth\u2019, making the large- scale and sustainable reintegration of ex- combatants impossible. Several scholarly studies have confi rmed the ineffective re- integration of ex-fi ghters. For instance, Ian Liebenberg and Marlene Roefs 50 state that 37 per cent of their sample was unemployed. The Centre for Confl ict Resolution\u2019s study 51 on the livelihood of ex-combatants found that 66 per cent of ex-fi ghters interviewed were unemployed, with a third suffering psychological problems. The situation was particularly depressing for ex-fi ghters who had hoped that independence would trans- late into guaranteed human security. The once-off gratuity for the common ex- fi ghter without fi nancial management skills did not effect the up-liftment and sustainable reintegration of most ex-fi ghters. While a no- ble gesture, the fl ash-funding gratuity would have needed to be relatively substantial and partnered by a solid skills development and entrepreneur-friendly scheme in order to sus- tainably reintegrate the ex-fi ghters. The good intentions of the Service Corps were unhinged by the absence of an ena- bling and appropriate institutional frame- work. The location of the Service Corps in the Department of Defence, and its manage- ment by military offi cers was problematic. The military can quite easily train civilians to become military personnel, but is least fi tted to reverse the process. In any event, the military was averse to sponsoring a per- ceived \u2018non-core\u2019 project at a time when international and non-government fund- ing for the resource-intensive venture was limited (except for an initial 141 million rand grant by the Taiwanese government to set up the fi rst vocational training centre). Further technical and fi nancial assistance promised by Taiwan was precluded by the government\u2019s political decision to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of mainland China. 49 Table 2: Demobilisation payments Category Years of Service Amount paid Numbers A 22-23 42,058 rand 172 B 18-21 34,313 rand 144 C 12-17 28,721 rand 534 D 5-11 20,201 rand 1,049 E 0-4 12,734 rand 2,003 Z Unspecifi ed 242 Source: James Higgs (1998).

About this article This paper explores the processes in the peace agreement and transitional arrange- ments from 2003 and 2005. It seeks to put into perspective the challenges faced thus far and argues in favour of a long term ap- proach to defence transformation as opposed tional defence forces, and the demobilisation of superfl uous fi ghters, the equally impor- tant reintegration component of DDR was inadequately addressed in all three countries. The government-led reintegration strate- gies were poorly implemented where policy statements were in place, but worse when they were an afterthought. This effectively created a gap between the two Ds of DDR (disarmament and demobilisation) and the R (reintegration). Despite the fact that some former fi ghters managed to secure cabi- net, government, parastatal and diplomatic postings, the sustainable reintegration of most former liberation fi ghters remained a problem. The governments that had failed to properly reintegrate ex-combatants later found themselves with a price to pay, as res- tive ex-fi ghters threatened national stability. This was a red fl ag that national authorities could hardly ignore, resulting in the im- plementation of various new reintegration initiatives. While DDR occurs in unique settings, the following broad recommendations can be taken from the three case studies, and should be considered when undertaking fu- ture processes: (cid:129) crafters and implementers of DDR should understand the dynamics of the preced- ing confl ict of which the process is a product; (cid:129) DDR should be an integral part of the peace negotiations, agreement and suc- ceeding peace process; of the new initiatives to correct the defi cien- cies of past reintegration strategies. Slow steps are being made towards the establish- ment of a representative national war vet- erans association that would facilitate im- plementation of the support provided under the Military Veterans Act. The full imple- mentation of the Act would mean public expenditure on war veterans translating to an elusive peace dividend, more than a dec- ade into democracy. At the time of writing, the Department of Defence is also working on the reorganisation of the Service Corps, mainly on matters relating to its appropriate location and partnerships.

As a photographer I have tried to show a realistic view of real daily life, far away from politics, away from what is associated with the confl ict and everything that comes with it. In general every war is analyzed from a political angle forgetting that, in most cases, the supporters are human beings. Human beings form in one way or another part of the drama called Iraq. This is a drama that not only affects the Iraqis who have to say goodbye to their family before leaving their homes; it has also infl uenced the fi rmest beliefs of people who have voluntarily embarked in a confl ict defending their values and who have with time seen themselves become relegated to a simple and primitive political weapon. Iraq is the birthplace of broken ideals \u2014 a place without future \u2014 which for those who sur- vive marks them for life, regardless if they are Iraqi or part of the international forces. It is a scenario which every day suffers from increasing dehumanization and with every passing day becomes an even sadder and more forgotten armed confl ict. Iraq is a confl ict forgotten by the media, as the coverage of the war diminishes day by day. Statistics and numbers are the only reality shown to the rest of the world to describe this tragedy. Since when can you summarise a human life into a fi gure? A confl ict forgotten by the large non-governmental organisations who barely approach or speak about the situ- ation in Iraq. Why are they actually there? A confl ict forgotten by the large powerful na- tions, who no longer see solutions to introduce order in a country which bleeds to death. As photographer I have committed myself to showing Iraq from the inside, from the daily life, from the familiar side. I wanted to show that daily life in Ramadi, Faluja, Baghdad\u2026 isn\u2019t very different to ours in the tranquillity of our own homes. The only \u2014 and biggest \u2014 difference is that our days aren\u2019t marked by death, while in Iraq they are. A LVARO Y BARRA Z AVALA ",

        "Introduction As in previous epochs, the world of the 21 st century faces a variety of political, economic, social and ecological pressures that threaten stability in many areas of the globe and embody a potential for violent confl ict. Many of these pressures are akin to those that have imperilled regional and international stability in the past: ethnic and religious antagonisms, the struggle for dominance between aspiring and established powers, territorial disputes, economic com- petition, and so on. It is likely, however, that additional sources of friction and instabil- ity will arise in this century, emerging from the distinctive features of the current era. Of these, one of the most signifi cant will be global competition for access to scarce or vital supplies of critical resources: water, oil, natural gas, arable land and key indus- trial minerals. 1 Facing resource competition The signifi cant role played by resource competition in sparking confl ict is evident in many of the recent outbreaks of armed violence, such as those in Aceh, Angola, Chad, Chechnya, Chiapas, Colombia, Con- go, Congo-Brazzaville, Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan. Like all human confl icts, these upheavals have more than one cause; all, however, are driven to a con- siderable extent by competition over vital or valuable resources: diamonds in the case of Angola, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; oil in the case of Aceh, Chechnya, Colombia, Congo-Brazzaville, Iraq and Sudan; timber and minerals in the Congo; arable land in Chiapas and Zimbabwe; and so on. It is true, of course, that competition over scarce and vital materials has long been a source of confl ict. Indeed, many of the ear- liest recorded wars \u2014 notably those occur- ring in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Jordan River valley \u2014 were driven by strug- gles over the control of critical water sources and arable land. Similarly, many of the wars of the 16th through to the early 20th cen- tury were sparked by competition between the major European powers for control over resource-rich colonies in Africa, Asia, the East Indies and the New World \u2014 struggles that culminated in the First World War. The rise of Nazism and the US-Soviet rivalry of the Cold War era tended to overshadow (but not eliminate) the importance of resource competition in the mid-20th century, but the end of the Cold War brought this factor once again to the fore, as evinced by the confl icts identifi ed above. One can argue, then, that the re-emer- gence of resource confl ict in the current pe- riod is nothing more than a return to the status quo ante : to the long stretch of time in which resource competition was a domi- nant force in world affairs. But it is the con- tention of this chapter that the situation we face today is not just more of the same: it is, instead, a qualitatively different situation, in which resource competition has assumed a more decisive and central role in armed confl ict than has been the case in the past. To appreciate this, it is necessary to con- sider both the importance of key resources to contemporary human endeavours and the unique pressures on the world\u2019s resource base at the onset of the 21 st century. Some resources are, of course, essential for human survival. All humans need a cer- tain amount of food and water, plus access to shelter, clothes and, in northern climates, heat. At a very primitive level of existence, human societies can function on relatively modest quantities of these materials, so long as their numbers remain few. As societies grow more complex, they require more re- sources for their own use and to produce trade goods to exchange for the things they lack, including luxury items sought by their elites. Modern means of warfare also con- sumes vast quantities of resources, especially petroleum to fuel the tanks, planes, helicop- ters and ships that have come to dominate R ESOURCE COMPETITION IN THE 21 ST CENTURY Michael T. Klare is the Five College Professor of Peace and World Security Studies (a joint appointment at Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, and Smith College and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst), a position he has held since 1985. Professor Klare has written widely on US defence policy, global resource politics and world security affairs. 1 The author fi rst articulated this argument in Michael T. Klare (2001).

        "the contemporary battlefi eld. The more de- veloped, urbanised, and prosperous a soci- ety, the greater its requirement for all re- sources of all types. The dilemma that confronts us at the dawn of the 21 st century is the fact that hu- man consumption of almost all types of ma- terials is growing at an ever-increasing rate, imposing growing and possibly intolerable pressures on the world\u2019s existing stockpile of natural resources. Until now, humans have been able to mitigate these pressures by de- veloping new sources of supply \u2014 for ex- ample, by digging deeper into the earth for metals and oil \u2014 and by inventing alterna- tive materials. No doubt human ingenuity and the power of the market will continue to generate solutions of this sort. At some point, however, the demand for certain vital resources will simply overwhelm the avail- able supply, producing widespread shortages and driving up the price of what remains; in some cases, moreover, it may prove impos- sible to develop viable substitutes. (There is no known substitute, for example, for fresh water). As resource stocks dwindle and pric- es rise, the divide between those with ac- cess to adequate supplies and those without will widen, straining the social fabric and in some cases leading to violent confl ict. 2 Even if disputes over the distribution of resources do not result in violence, the stresses engendered by resource pressures will affect human society in several ways. For many countries, the tempo of econom- ic growth will decline as domestic supplies of vital materials contract and the price of imports rises. For those states still in pos- session of valuable resources, the impulse to extract and sell as much as possible while prices are high could lead to severe and costly environmental damage. And the entire planet will suffer from the by-prod- ucts of unrestrained resource consumption \u2014 among them, increased greenhouse-gas emissions, the build-up of toxic wastes, fi sh- eries collapse, biodiversity loss and severe soil degradation. It is apparent, then, that resource competi- tion will play an increasingly signifi cant role in world affairs as time proceeds. Just how substantial its impact will be will depend, to a considerable extent, on the evolution of human consumption patterns. The greater the pressure we bring to bear on the world\u2019s existing resource base, the higher the risk of major social and environmental trauma. It is essential, then, to consider the implication of fi ve key trends in contemporary human behaviour: globalisation, population growth, urbanisation and resource depletion. Globalisation The growing internationalisation of fi - nance, manufacturing and trade is having a powerful effect on many aspects of hu- man life, including the demand for and con- sumption of basic resources. Globalisation increases the demand for resources in sev- eral ways. Most signifi cant is the spread of industrialisation to more and more areas of the world, producing a dramatic increase in the demand for energy, minerals and other basic commodities. The spurt in demand for energy is espe- cially evident in the newly industrialised countries of Asia, which are expected to continue growing at a rapid pace in the coming decades. According to the US De- partment of Energy (DoE), energy consump- tion in developing Asia (including China, India, South Korea and Taiwan) will grow by an estimated 3.2 per cent per year dur- ing the fi rst three decades of the 21 st cen- tury, producing a net increase in demand of more than 215 per cent over this period. The growth in demand for petroleum will be par- ticular pronounced, with total consumption in developing Asia jumping from 14 million barrels per day in 2001 to 30 million barrels in 2030. 3 A similar pattern is evident with respect to consumption of natural gas and coal \u2014 both of which are projected to expe- rience a substantial increase in demand in this region in the coming decades. The rising consumption energy, along with other ma- terials needed to sustain economic growth in the newly industrialised countries, will 2 For discussion, see Thomas Homer-Dixon, \u2018Environmental scarcities and violent confl ict,\u2019 International Security, vol. 19, no. 1 (summer 1994), p. 5-40. 3 US Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (DoE/EIA), International Energy Outlook 2007 (Washington, D.C.: DoE/EIA, 2007), tables A1 and A5, p. 83, 88.

        "signifi cantly increase the pressures already being placed on the global resource base. Globalisation is further adding to the pres- sure on resources by contributing to the emergence of a new middle class in many parts of the world. As families acquire ad- ditional income, they tend to acquire more goods and appliances, eat higher-end foods (such as beef, pork and chicken), and to move into larger living quarters \u2014 all of which generates a steep increase in the consump- tion of basic materials. Most signifi cant in this regard is the growing international de- mand for private vehicles, a process known as the \u2018motorisation\u2019 of society. The motori- sation rate (usually measured in number of vehicles per thousand population) is sky- rocketing in many developing countries as economic growth accelerates and personal income rises. \u2018In many urban centres, such as Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta, Shanghai, and Mumbai, car ownership is among the fi rst symbols of emerging prosperity\u2019. 4 By 2020, the global population of motor vehicles will grow to an estimated 1.1 billion units \u2014 425 million above the level for 1996. 5 Just to produce all of these vehicles will entail the consumption of vast amounts of iron, alu- minium and other minerals; once in opera- tion, they will consume millions of gallons of oil per day, year after year. Finally, globalisation affects the global re- source equation by extending the worldwide reach of multinational companies (MNCs), generating signifi cant economic benefi ts for many poor and isolated countries but also providing incentives for cash-starved gov- ernments to permit the extraction of raw materials beyond sustainable levels or the destruction of forests to make way for ex- port-oriented ranching and agriculture. The ever-expanding reach of MNCs also facili- tates the entry of warlords, insurgent groups and corrupt military factions into resource- related enterprises. In many cases, these ac- tors have used their ties to such fi rms to fi nance the illicit acquisition of arms and other military items. In Liberia, for example, the rebel force once led by Charles Taylor traded timber and mineral rights for the cash needed to purchase arms and ammunition; in Sierra Leone and Angola, the rebels trad- ed diamonds for guns. 6 These transactions have increased the duration and severity of a number of internal confl icts, producing vast human suffering and placing a mam- moth burden on the world\u2019s humanitarian aid organisations. Population growth Rising population is further adding to the pressures on the world\u2019s resource base. Ac- cording to the World Resources Institute (WRI), total world population will reach ap- proximately 8 billion people in 2025, or two billion more than the number in 2000. These two billion additional people will need to be fed, housed, clothed and otherwise provided with basic necessities \u2014 producing a corre- sponding requirement for food, water, wood, metals, fi bres and other materials. Although the earth can supply these materials, at least in the amounts needed for a relatively mod- est standard of living, it cannot continue to sustain an ever-growing human popu- lation and satisfy the rising expectations of the world\u2019s middle and upper classes. At some point, signifi cant shortages will oc- cur, intensifying the competition for access to remaining supplies and producing severe hardship for those without the means to pay the higher prices thereby incurred. Of all basic necessities, the one that is most likely to be affected by population growth is fresh water. Humans must have access to a certain amount of water every day, for drinking, personal hygiene and food produc- tion. Fortunately, the world possesses suf- fi cient renewable supplies of fresh water to satisfy current requirements and to sustain some increase in the human population. But the pressure on many key sources of supply is growing, suggesting that severe shortages will develop in some water-scarce areas over 4 Doe/EIA, International Energy Outlook 1999, p. 133. 5 Ibid., p. 117. 6 On Liberia, see William Reno, \u2018Reinvention of an African patrimonial state: Charles Taylor\u2019s Liberia\u2019, Third World Quarterly, vol. 16, no. 1 (1995), pp. 109-20.

        "the next few decades. This is especially true in the Middle East and North Africa, where fresh water is already in short supply and population growth rates are among the high- est in the world. For example, the number of people who will be relying on the Nile River, the Jordan River and the Tigris\u2014Euphrates system for all or most of their water supply will grow from approximately 325 million in 2000 to 740 million in 2050 \u2014 without any appreciable increase in the net supply of water in the region. Unless the existing sources of supply are used more effi ciently, or the desalination of seawater proves more affordable, competition over access to water will become more intense in these areas and could lead to war. 7 Population growth is also likely to place growing pressure on the world\u2019s supply of arable land. This is especially true in the developing areas, where many people still rely on agriculture for their basic survival or for family income. As population expands, farmers tend to crop their existing plots more intensively or to bring marginal lands into cultivation, thereby depleting the soil of es- sential nutrients and risking the onset of erosion. The ever-growing demand for cro- pland also leads to the accelerated clearing of virgin forests, eradicating the habitats of many unique plant and animal species. Urbanisation Closely related to population growth but adding distinctive pressures of its own is the growing concentration of humans in large towns and cities. Throughout the world \u2014 but especially in the developing world \u2014 people are moving from rural to urban areas, and from small to large cities. According to WRI, the world\u2019s urban population surged from 1.5 billion people in 1975 to 2.6 bil- lion in 1995, and is expected to jump again to 5.1 billion by the year 2025. 8 In many cases, moreover, people are moving to very large cities: by 2015, an estimated 1.7 bil- lion people (nearly one-fourth of the world\u2019s total population) will be living in cities of over 1 million people. 9 This has enormous implications for global resource stocks, as urban communities tend to consume more energy, water and building materials, and to generate far more waste products than rural areas. The outward expansion of cities and suburbs is also usurping areas previously used for agriculture, thereby adding to the pressure on the world\u2019s remaining supply of arable land. 10 From a resource perspective, the impact of urbanisation cannot always be distinguished from that of globalisation and population growth. All of these phenomena are adding to the worldwide demand for water, energy and other basic commodities. But the con- centration of more and more people in large cities does have a particularly pronounced impact on global water supplies, as urban areas require vast quantities of water for sanitation and personal use, and also be- cause cities produce copious waste products that are often poured into rivers and lakes \u2014 thereby diminishing the amount of clean water available to other users. Providing adequate supplies of water to large urban centres and neighbouring areas, therefore, prove to be one of the most demanding tasks facing local and national leaders in the 21 st century. Resource depletion The three factors described above \u2014 globalisation, population growth and urban- isation \u2014 are combining to create a fourth: the irreversible depletion of some non- renewable resources. While the earth contains large amounts of many of the most vital materials, these supplies are not unlim- ited and can be exhausted through excessive extraction or utilisation. And, in the case of some vital resources, humans have reached this point or are likely to do so in the early decades of the 21 st century. For example, humans have harvested some species of fi sh (such as the once-prolifi c cod) so intensively that they have virtually disappeared from [ 296 ] 7 For background and data, see Peter H.

        "the world\u2019s oceans and are not expected to recover. Similarly, some valuable types of hardwood have largely disappeared from the world\u2019s forests. Of the resources that are facing depletion in the decades ahead, none is more impor- tant to human life and society than natural petroleum. Oil supplies about two-fi fth\u2019s of the world\u2019s basic energy supply \u2014 more than any other source \u2014 and provides about 97 per cent of the energy used for transporta- tion. It is an essential feedstock for many valuable products, including plastics, ferti- lisers, pesticides, asphalt and certain phar- maceuticals. Petroleum is also a non-renew- able resource: once we consume the existing world supply (produced by geological proc- esses many eons ago), there will be none left for future generations. So far, humans have consumed nearly one-half of the earth\u2019s original petroleum inheritance (1.0 trillion barrels out of the 2.2 trillion barrels that are thought to have existed in 1860, when commercial extraction began), but we are extracting oil at such an intensive rate that much of the remaining supply could disap- pear in the next 30-40 years. The introduc- tion of new technologies and fuel sources \u2014 such as ethanol, coal-to-liquids and hy- drogen-powered fuel cells \u2014 could slow the rate of oil depletion in the years ahead, but at present we are continuing to increase our total consumption year after year. Fresh water is a renewable resource and so will never disappear, but it can be viewed as a non-renewable substance because the earth\u2019s habitable areas only receive a cer- tain amount of it each year in the form of precipitation. Of this amount \u2014 approxi- mately 110,000 km 3 \u2014 a large share is lost to evaporation, discharge into the oceans and absorption by plants and the soil, leav- ing only 12,500 km 3 for use by humans. At present, we are using approximately half of this supply, and are increasing our utilisa- tion at such a high rate (because of popula- tion growth, urbanisation, industrialisation and irrigated agriculture) that we will begin to approach full utilisation by the middle of the century \u2014 at which point billions of people can be expected to suffer from severe water shortages. Global climate change All of these problems are bound to be ex- acerbated by the effects of global climate change. Although climate scientists cannot be certain about the future effects of climate change on any particular locale, they are in- creasingly convinced that large parts of the plant will suffer from persistent droughts, di- minished rainfall, and the invasion of coastal areas by a rise in the sea level. This will, in turn, jeopardise water supplies and food production in many tropical and temper- ate areas of the world, forcing millions of people \u2014 perhaps tens or even hundreds of millions \u2014 to abandon their ancestral lands and migrate to other, less-severely affected areas. The result could well be an increase in confl ict over access to fresh water and arable land. 11 Climate change will also effect the planet\u2019s energy equation in various ways. An in- crease in severe storm activity, for example, will endanger oil and natural gas production in such key producing areas as the Gulf of Mexico, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea. Because so much of America\u2019s oil produc- tion, distribution and refi ning is concentrat- ed in the Gulf of Mexico area, future storms like 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina will have a devastating effect on the nation\u2019s oil out- put. The reduced levels of rainfall expected from global warming in many parts of the world will also reduce the fl ow of water into many rivers that have been dammed for the purpose of generating electricity; with less rainfall, these hydro-electricity plants could sit idle for long stretches of time.

Great Britain\u2019s determined efforts to retain a presence in Iraq after the Second World War and to retain control of its refi nery at Abadan in Iran after its nationalisation by Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1951 also fi t this pattern. For the United States, ensuring access to the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf has long been a major military objective. This was made an explicit strategic objective in the so-called \u2018Carter Doctrine\u2019 of 23 January 1980. Asserting that \u2018[a]n attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region\u2019 \u2014 and impede the fl ow of oil \u2014 \u2018will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America\u2019, Carter warned that his country would repel such an assault \u2018by any means necessary, including military force\u2019. 13 This basic prin- ciple was then cited by President George H. W. Bush as the justifi cation for going to war against Iraq when it invaded Kuwait in 1990 (and, it was said, posed a threat to Saudi Arabia) as well as for the subsequent quarantine of Iraq by Presidents Bush senior and Clinton. 14 From a strategic perspective, it can also be viewed as the impetus for the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. 15 trea and Ethiopia being a conspicuous ex- ample \u2014 but have become less frequent in recent years as states have slowly but surely resolved outstanding boundary disputes. Confl icts over offshore territories, howev- er, appear to be becoming more frequent as governments fi ght over contested maritime EEZs (exclusive economic zones) with valu- able fi sheries and undersea resources, such as oil and natural gas. For example, China has fought with Vietnam and the Philip- pines over ownership of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, a potential source of energy; likewise, Iran and Azerbaijan have clashed over disputed offshore territories in the Caspian Sea. 12 So long as states see a vital national interest in controlling such areas, disputes over contested EEZs will be a recurring factor in international affairs. Access confl icts Access confl icts arise from efforts by a re- source-importing nation to ensure its ability to procure needed resources from a distant source and to transport them safely to its own territory. Many of the colonial wars of past centuries were sparked by such efforts, as was Germany\u2019s 1941 invasion of the Sovi- et Union (intended in part to seize control of the oil fi elds of the Caucasus region) and Ja- pan\u2019s subsequent invasion of the Dutch East sources of vital materials. In the extreme case, such antagonisms can lead to the out- break of armed violence. In general, violent struggle over resources can take one of four forms: fi rst, territorial disputes between competing states over the ownership of contested border zones or off- shore areas harbouring valuable supplies of critical materials; access confl icts arising from efforts by an outside power to gain or preserve access to a foreign source of critical materials; allocation disputes arising from disagreements over the distribution of sup- plies from a shared resource source (such as a multinational river system); and revenue disputes arising from struggles between con- tending factions for monopolisation of the rents or profi ts generated by control over a valuable resource source, such as an oil fi eld or copper mine, or the illicit traffi c in \u2018loota- ble\u2019 goods, like diamonds or old-growth tim- ber. Most of the confl icts of the post-Cold War era embody aspects of one or another of these confl ict types.

Indeed, the exigen- cies of national security have been cited by government offi cials to justify the onset or continuation of combat in many of the con- fl icts mentioned above. For some countries, notably those with very limited supplies, water has been por- trayed as a national security matter. For ex- ample, Israel has declared that access to the waters of the Jordan River is vital to its sur- vival, just as Egypt as long viewed the Nile River in this fashion. For other nations, es- pecially the United States and China, it is oil that has been viewed as a matter of national security \u2014 as exemplifi ed, for example, in the \u2018Carter Doctrine\u2019 of 1980. So long as vital resources are viewed through the lens of national security, governments will often respond with military force when possession of or access to critical sources of supply is deemed to be at risk. Violence is also likely when internal factions in divided states be- lieve that control over a valuable resource site is essential to their survival. Only by posing an alternative perspective \u2014 one that posits the advantages of cooperative, non- violent outcomes to such disputes \u2014 will it be possible to avert recurring confl ict over scarce and valuable resources. Devising such outcomes and promoting their benefi ts is, therefore, an essential precondition for last- ing peace and stability in the 21 st century. Averting confl ict over scarce resources Assuming that the necessary political will can be generated, friction arising from the key fi gures involved. Hence the tenacity with which groups like UNITA (National Un- ion for the Total Independence of Angola) and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) of Sierra Leone fought for control over their nation\u2019s diamond fi elds and resisted all at- tempts at a negotiated settlement. Confl icts over the possession of valua- ble resources sites can also fi gure in efforts by ethnic groups living in areas adjacent to such assets to establish a separate enclave and the corresponding efforts by the domi- nant state to retain possession of the region \u2014 a pattern seen in Indonesia\u2019s struggle to retain control of oil-rich Aceh and copper- rich Irian Jaya (West Papua). This pattern is also a key factor in the sectarian fi ghting in Iraq, with the Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south seeking exclusive control over the abundant oil reserves in their respective regions and the Sunnis in the middle (which mostly lacks oil) struggling to prevent this from occurring. Violence is not, of course, the only pos- sible response to resource competition: as will be argued below, there are many other plausible responses to scarcity. But the risk of violence is always latent when states per- ceive the possession of certain materials as national security matter \u2014 that is, as some- thing so vital to the survival and a well-be- ing of a nation that it is prepared to employ military force when deemed necessary to ensure access to that resource, even if this means that other countries will be forced Allocation disputes Allocation disputes arise when neighbour- ing states jointly occupy or rely on a shared resource source \u2014 a river system, under- ground aquifer or oil fi eld. In such cases, confl ict can erupt from disagreements over the distribution of materials taken from the shared resource. For example, Iraq, Syria and Turkey have been fi ghting over the al- location of water from the Tigris\u2014Euphra- tes river system, which originates in Turkey but travels for much of its length through Iraq and Syria. The Jordan and Nile Rivers have also provoked allocation disputes of this sort, both in ancient times and in the present. The extraction of petroleum from a shared underground reservoir can also be a source of confl ict, as demonstrated by Iraq\u2019s dispute with Kuwait over the prolifi c Rumaila fi eld. Revenue disputes Revenue disputes usually occur in deeply divided or failing states where the national government has lost control of much or part of its territory and competing factions \u2014 warlords, ethnic or tribal militias, separatist groups and the like \u2014 are fi ghting for control over an oilfi eld, mine, diamond fi eld or some other resource that represents a signifi cant source of revenue. Such struggles can prove particularly intense, as the outcome will of- ten determine which faction will secure the revenues they need to procure arms and am- munition, pay its soldiers and otherwise en- sure its survival; these revenues can also be- come a major source of personal wealth for ",
        "[ 300 ] through mediation and adjudication, or through schemes for the joint exploitation of a shared or contested resource site. Bound- ary disputes are particularly well suited to international mediation and adjudication: a number of such disagreements have been resolved in recent years when the parties in- volved agreed to seek a determination from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague. For example, the ICJ has taken up the disputes between Bahrain and Qatar over Hawar Island, and between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula. (Both areas are thought to sit above signifi cant reserves of oil or natural gas). Mediation by the World Bank also led to the adoption of the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960, thus avert- ing war between India and Pakistan over the distribution of water from the shared Indus River system. Joint development of contested resources is another approach that is gaining favour in some areas: China and the ASEAN countries have discussed the joint develop- ment of oil and gas in the South China Sea area, and Egypt and its upstream neighbours have met to consider plans for the joint de- velopment of the Nile River system. Conservation Technology and adjudication can help ad- dress some resource problems, but ultimately the best way to avert signifi cant shortages of scarce or limited supplies is to consume less of what we do possess of these materi- als. Indeed, conservation is often the least costly and most practical method of expand- ing the long-term supply of a resource. For example, the imposition of tougher fuel ef- fi ciency standards on American automobiles and trucks would reduce America\u2019s petrole- um consumption by millions of barrels per day. Likewise, the widespread use of drip irrigation would greatly reduce the wastage of water through existing irrigation tech- niques. The systemic recycling of materials also helps to reduce the depletion of scarce resources. These and other such techniques can be employed to slow the consumption of vital resources and to channel confl ict into pro- ductive, non-violent outcomes. Many sci- entists, economists, environmentalists and government leaders perceive the urgent need for such efforts, and have advocated them in every available setting. As a result, progress is being made in many critical areas. But strong resistance to such efforts has been mounted by some companies that benefi t from exist- ing modes of consumption and from politi- cians who view vital resources from a tradi- tional national security perspective, with its zero-sum, all-for-us-and-nothing-for-them outlook. For example, the major US auto companies have fought against any increase in minimum fuel effi ciency standards, and some conservatives in the United States have advocated efforts to constrain China\u2019s access to the petroleum supplies of the Persian Gulf. Many consumers, especially in the wealthier countries, are also reluctant to reduce their consumption of water, petroleum, rare timber (like teak and mahogany) and other scarce or limited materials. resource scarcity can be channelled into constructive, non-violent outcomes through three types of initiatives: technological innovation; adjudication, mediation and cooperation; and conservation. Technological innovation Technology can go a long way to reducing the threat of confl ict over scarce resources by providing alternative materials and less resource-depleting processes. For example, improvements in desalination technology would make it possible to convert sea water into fresh water at an affordable cost (ex- isting methods consume large amounts of energy and are very costly). Similarly, the consumption of petroleum in transporta- tion could be substantially reduced through the widespread use of hybrid (gas/electric) vehicles and fuel effi cient diesel engines. Eventually, the use of petroleum products for ground transportation could be elimi- nated altogether through the introduction of alternative fuels derived from biomass or the widespread utilisation of hydrogen-powered fuel cells. Improved methods of harnessing solar and wind energy would also reduce the need for petroleum. Technological innova- tion can help eliminate or minimise a wide variety of other resource constraints, greatly reducing the risk of confl ict. Adjudication, mediation and cooperation Given the risky and costly nature of war, states and other parties often conclude that it is preferable to resolve resource disputes ",

Circumvention is not being addressed through the FLEGT Action Plan. For three years ICS travelled to various Member States and the European Commis- sion to lobby for new laws. They wanted additional measures that would tackle the consumption, the demand, and drive for timber and wood products. With pressure from other civil society and the interna- tional NGO community a process is now in place to look at what laws could be brought to bear that would stop illegally sourced timber and wood products from entering the European markets. There are currently four options on the table to be considered as new laws: \u2022 expanded coverage of the bilateral ap- proach through VPAs; \u2022 private sector measures like codes of con- duct, certifi cation schemes, etc; \u2022 an import ban on illegally harvested timber; \u2022 legislation prohibiting the placing on the EU market illegally harvested timber or Over the past three years Indonesian civil society has taken the lead on this issue. They have led a process within Indonesia in ob- taining common positions with regard to the many issues from independent monitoring, money laundering, indigenous rights and access to land. They have together with the government and industry worked toward a defi nition of legality. This defi nition was concluded this year and is now in process through the Ministry of Forestry. Indonesia is the fi rst country to look at the myriad of laws and recognise that reform was needed in this sector and has gone ahead together with stakeholders to set the standard for other countries negotiating VPAs.

We have witnessed a fl owering of civil society groups campaign- ing on a host of issues such as corruption, labour rights, press freedom, land rights and the environment. The strengthening of civil society has been the key in advancing the fi ght against corruption, exposure of abuse and violence in the forest and part of the solution to confl ict within this environment. Such was the pressure and public exposure of the role Indonesia was playing in the global trade of illegally sourced timber and wood products that in 2001 it hosted a min- isterial conference in Bali that resulted in a declaration to combat this crime. In essence what we had was an acknowledgement from some of the biggest producer countries that illegal logging existed and at the core of this was corruption. Following the Bali conference the EU re- sponded. What is now known as the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), an action plan has been agreed to by Member States. 5 The FLEGT Action Plan focuses on improving governance in timber- producing countries, and establishing sys- tems to exclude illegally sourced timber into the European market. Further it allows for timber producing countries to enter into a bilateral agreement with the EU called a Vol- untary Partnership Agreement (VPA).

If you look at confl ict timber from a coun- try such as Burma/Myanmar the only thing in place to address this is the sanctions im- posed against the country from the United States under the Freedom and Democracy Act. Within that, these sanctions only deal products derived from such timber. These included two variants: one making it an offence to trade or process timber and timber products harvested in breach of the laws of the country of origin, and one that would require that only legally harvested timber and timber products be placed on the market: proof of legality.

If illegally cut timber from Cameroon is ex- ported, it is effectively laundered as soon as it reaches international waters. The US is on the verge of passing into law the Legal Timber Protection Act and in the EU, NGOs have lobbied for a law to prohibit importing illegally sourced timber. However, under the FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Government and Trade) process, this has morphed into bilateral licensing agreements between EU states and producing countries. These kinds of voluntary partnership agree- ments between two countries are much eas- ier to bypass. Smuggled timber could still originate from other countries or be sold to those who have not signed the agreement. We hope that there will eventually be an EU regulation on this. It is crazy to allow a trade in stolen goods. It is not allowed for cars so why should it be allowed for timber? How did Global Witness pick up the issue of confl ict diamonds? Why did the campaign gain such a high profi le and how did it lead to the Kimberley Process? The civil war in Angola, which took place throughout the 1990s, was killing hundreds of thousands of people. On the UNITA rebel side, the confl ict was funded primarily by ging around the world is that tropical forests are very often regarded by economists as a resource that can kick-start an economy in a post-confl ict or economically vulnerable country. We have seen that attitude in many countries from Cambodia to Cameroon. In reality, illegal logging, incredible levels of corruption, and the over-cutting of trees mean the forests do not deliver the durable benefi ts that the economists expect. On the contrary, poverty is usually exacerbated. In Cambodia, after our work on the Khmer Rouge issue, we investigated the govern- ment\u2019s role in the allocation of forests to pri- vate logging companies. It was very corrupt and in one particular year, a minimum of US $187 million of timber was smuggled out of the country and only US $12 million made it into the exchequer. Eventually the international community called on the Cambodian government to in- troduce independent oversight of the trade and Global Witness was appointed to do that. Our role was not law enforcement but monitoring of law enforcement. Our work was effective in terms of the reduction in illegal activities but the vested interests went right to the top level. Expos- ing that kind of information put us in an uncomfortable position and in Cambodia our contract was terminated, while in Cam- eroon, a similar contract expired and could not be renewed with terms that would have maintained our independence. Why did you create Global Witness? Global Witness is a British-based NGO, which I founded in 1992 together with two colleagues, Simon Taylor and Charmian Gooch. At the time, we were working for an environmental agency that looked at is- sues such as the ivory trade. We created Glo- bal Witness because we realised there was a whole area not being addressed: the crosso- ver between the exploitation of natural re- sources and confl ict and corruption. This became clear in 1992 when the UN was brokering elections in Cambodia. At the time, it was the most expensive intervention in the UN\u2019s history. According to news re- ports, the Khmer Rouge rebels had boycotted the elections and were trading timber with the Thais. The rainforest was being cut down and was obviously providing some kind of revenue to the Khmer Rouge, which they were using to fi ght the war. We saw that no one was look- ing at this link. We also thought, with the campaigning knowledge that we had, that if we closed the Thai-Cambodia border to that trade, we would cut funding to the Khmer Rouge and stop the war. Perhaps that sounds simplistic and na\u00efve, but it worked. What progress has been made in tack- ling the illegal timber trade since then? Can you explain your role as an independent monitor?

Production conditions are not really an issue for the Kimberley Process, which was never meant to be a panacea for all the ills of the diamond trade. Of course, labour condi- tions in the extraction process are a concern. Other actions, such as the Diamond Devel- opment Initiative, are looking at that. There are also environmental issues: alluvial dia- mond mining is very destructive, for exam- ple. Global Witness has not looked at these issues, not because we do not think they are important, but because we have our hands full with the Kimberley Process. Would it be appropriate to have a Kimber- ley Process equivalent for other gemstones or natural resources? The Kimberley Process was the fi rst time natural resources had gained prominence in that way. It captured the public and politi- cal imagination because diamonds are sexy. Therefore, the agreement was made. In hindsight, there are several things wrong with it. For example, the defi nition of confl ict diamonds is fl awed under the Kimberley Process: it talks about diamonds from \u2018rebel-held areas'. That would not ap- ply to confl ict diamonds traded by even the most brutal dictator in the world. There has been a knee-jerk reaction from many policy-makers who would be in fa- vour of replicating the Kimberley Process success story for other resources. There sim- ply would not be the appetite for that. The Kimberley Process resulted in a lot of meet- the industry did get the message fast. In the early days of the campaign, De Beers was terrifi ed that we were planning an anti-fur type approach, i.e. to promote a boycott of diamonds. They were spending around US $200 million a year in advertising and they knew that we could wreck that with just tens of thousands of dollars. But that was never the case. We are not against the diamond trade, only against the trade in confl ict diamonds. \u2018Blood Diamond' was amazingly helpful. Ivory Coast is now the only country where there are still technically any confl ict dia- monds, but the potential for the confl ict diamond trade to continue or return is still there. When the fi lm came out, the industry was trying to tell the world that the prob- lem was solved, which was not the case. In a way that nothing else could, the fi lm was able to bring it up in a way that the public could understand. Establishing the Kimberley Process was a great success but questions have been raised as to how it can be effectively monitored. It also does not cover other issues such as labour conditions during the production process. Monitoring is a diffi cult question. You need verifi cation of the trade chain in the producing countries, and this was one of the challenges from the beginning. That is what certifi cation is all about. The latest Kimberley Process meeting, held in Brussels in November 2007, started to look at trading centres, not just production. Momentum is growing. That is the kind of diamonds and on the government side, pri- marily by oil. The De Beers cartel was buying 80 per cent of the world\u2019s rough diamonds at that time. They freely admitted in their annual reports that they were buying from Angola, yet the diamond fi elds were un- der the control of UNITA. This was clearly a problem! Angola was not the only place with this kind of situation but, in campaign terms, you have to deliver a message that people can read and understand. In 1998, we produced a report, \u2018Rough Trade\u2019, which included ex- tracts from the De Beers report. We con- cluded that there was an unacceptable open trade in diamonds and noted there was no policy initiative to deal with this. Our report coincided with the war break- ing out once again in Angola. Consequently, journalists covering the war used our report and we were inundated with requests from the media. You usually have to work hard for press coverage, but in this case, it came easily. It hit the right vein in both public and political consciousness. The term \u2018confl ict diamonds\u2019, hitherto un- known, was suddenly on everybody\u2019s lips. To give credit, the governments in Britain and the US were already sympathetic to the issue and we had meetings with them and other governments, which led to the creation of the Kimberley Process. How have consumers made an impact? Was the 2006 fi lm \u2018Blood Diamond\u2019 helpful? I could not say how many consumers we reached in our awareness-raising work, but ",

The US has the same attitude with oil-rich states like Equa- torial Guinea. The Western consuming pow- ers blazed a trail in unethical acquisition of resources that others have followed. How can communities and national gov- ernments negotiate good deals with strong, multinational companies that often have an annual turnover that dwarfs the country\u2019s GDP? The international community needs to help nations that are economically vulnerable or in a post-confl ict situation. If I use the lat- ter case as an example, there can be an in- terim period of two-to-four years between a peace deal being signed and a democratically elected government being installed. In these cases, a caretaker government is often put in place with the support of the international community. In Liberia, for example, a transitional gov- ernment signed a 25-year iron ore deal worth only US $900 million with Mittal Steel. Un- der the terms of the contract, the company controlled every stage of the revenue fl ow because neither the price nor the method of setting the price was fi xed. It even effectively created a state within a state. An unelected transitional government, which at the time only had six months left before elections, should not have had the right to sign such a deal. Fortunately, in this case, when the oil companies to publish what they pay. That is the campaign we launched in 1999. We became a co-founder of the Publish What You Pay coalition. It was essentially about revenue transparency. That has grown into a very effective coalition of over 300 NGOs. It has also led to the creation of the Extrac- tive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is the major mechanism to deal with revenue transparency. How does China\u2019s demand for resources affect the situation in Africa? I have an African friend who says that people do not care who buys the resources; what they want is the revenue to go to the right places. Having said that, transparency initiatives such as EITI and Publish What You Pay are put at risk because China\u2019s fi nancial support has no political strings attached. Any attempt at exerting pressure on African countries \u2014 regarding corruption, transpar- ency, or human rights \u2014 is undermined if they can get what they want from China. In countries where too much GDP is based on primary commodity exports, it can lead directly to what is known as the \u2018resource curse\u2019. Governments become less account- able to their people and it breeds instability. In the longer term, it is neither sustainable for those countries, nor for China. To address the issue, we need to look at how resources are accessed. Revenue trans- parency is critical, as is how those revenues are used. It is very important the internation- al community get together to make that hap- pen. It is not something that can be achieved ings around the world involving hundreds of people, which would not happen for every resource. We need to look at what worked for the Kimberley Process and fi nd something that is a catchall for all those resources. Let\u2019s not get distracted by just one. We also need a much better understanding of what a con- fl ict resource is. Until we have that, there will never be a coherent response to it. What impact can transparency initiatives such as \u2018Publish What You Pay\u2019 make? Have governments been willing to cooperate? This also grew out of our work in Angola. As I said previously, the war was funded on the government side by oil and the rebel side by diamonds. We thought we could not just address one side of the problem because it would make it a partisan issue. Shortly after we produced our fi rst work on diamonds, we came out with a report on oil. A country has a sovereign right to sell its oil. The question was how the govern- ment was spending the revenues. Angola was amazingly opaque on this issue. Our best estimates, and those of the IMF, were that around a quarter of the US $4 billion oil revenues was going missing. While the war effort was being funded, health and education systems were at a standstill. People need to know what their governments are earning to be able to call them to account. Nobody could question the Angolan government because nobody knew what the revenues were. Since they refused to publish what they received, we asked the ",

Vested interests are a diffi culty: for exam- ple, when we were trying to get sanctions on Liberian timber through the UN, the two countries that initially objected were France and China who also happened to be the big- gest buyers of Liberian timber. When Charles Taylor was causing the situation in the Ivory Coast to degenerate, France changed its view because its interests suddenly changed. Bureaucracy is a major issue, wheth- er dealing with the UN or the EU. And the size of the EU is a diffi culty. The timber is- sue passed through several directorates and the result was a watered down process that was much longer than necessary. The simple thing would have been to pass a law. The donor community, including the World Bank, condemn corruption in many countries as a major barrier to development. Very often aid provision has been suppos- edly conditional on eradicating corruption. But when push comes to shove, they do not do anything about it. Corrupt dictators can freely come to our shores to do their shop- ping and conditions that are imposed on aid are not enforced. This does not only fail to solve the problem, it exacerbates it. new government was elected it had a lot of public and political support and a few phi- lanthropists, such as George Soros, came in and helped President Johnson-Sirleaf nego- tiate a better deal. The international community must fi nd a cohesive position on post-confl ict devel- opment. Natural resources must be a major part of any post-confl ict process because they are probably a country\u2019s best route to economic prosperity. It is not just about post-confl ict situations. Even if the new Liberian government had ne- gotiated the fi rst deal, they would not have had access to the same level of corporate le- gal advice as Mittal Steel. Countries are ter- rifi ed of frightening off investors and some- times do not realise the strong position they are in. They need top legal help to negotiate good deals and to get wise in a cut-throat corporate world. Your role involves not only partnership with NGOs, but also with governments and international organisations. What diffi cul- ties arise? We know that to change policy you have to deal with the policy-makers.

How does WATEX\u00a9 work? This paper describes how the geospatial WATEX\u00a9 process was utilised by RTF to as- sess the water potential of Eastern Chad and Darfur in Sudan without requiring time- consuming fi eld surveys on ground cali- brations for the remote sensing portion of the project. Field surveys in Sudan were completed with ground penetrating radar equipment. As demonstrated in Chad with the case study of Gaga Camp, the project enabled the UNHCR to, in a very short time, identify new campsites in eastern Chad capable of the identifi cation of four major campsites able to host some 200,000 new refugees. It also led to the transfer of the fi rst group of 15,000 refugees to the newly identifi ed Gaga Campsite, 65 km east of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 and to the increase of drilling success rate from 33 per cent before WATEX\u00a9 to 89 per cent using the WATEX\u00a9 methodology. In December 2005, the US State Depart- ment invited me to apply the WATEX\u00a9 proc- ess throughout Darfur in Sudan, over an area of 135,000 km 2 , for 2.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), under the supervi- sion of Dr Saud Amer from the US Geologi- cal Survey (USGS). 3 This project, accomplished in six months, revealed that there is enough groundwater in Darfur for several million people \u2014 enough to sustain the peace process and the recon- struction through agricultural development. 4 These results were forwarded at the request of the US Agency for International Develop- ment (USAID) to 40 NGOs in October 2006 in Khartoum. The Darfur Drilling Handbook, 5 based on WATEX\u00a9 results, was distributed to all the organisations attending the training seminar supported by USAID and UNESCO (Chair in Water Resources, Sudan). Introduction In March 2004, the UN Offi ce for the Co- ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNO- CHA) faced a severe challenge in providing assistance to 110,000 refugees from Sudan in Chad, which grew to 200,000 a few months later. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) requested urgently the services of Radar Technologies France (RTF) to use the WATEX\u00a9 process in order to de- tect and map the water potential of Eastern Ouadda\u00ef in Chad to support existing camps, identify new buried aquifers and support future refugee camps throughout the region and avoid costly water trucking. In just four months, RTF recorded amazing results applying the WATEX\u00a9-based method- ology 1 to map the water potential of a region nearly 100,000 km 2 in size. The humanitarian dimension of the project demanded timely and effi cient identifi cation of sustainable aq- uifers producing suffi cient volumes of clean water to support existing and future refugee operations.

The WATEX\u00a9 process UNHCR, together with USAID, recognised an opportunity to apply geospatial technolo- gies in responding to the Darfur crisis, creat- ing an excellent example of the positive role the private sector can play in humanitarian assistance and sustainable development. The WATEX\u00a9 process is a groundwater exploration package used to locate renew- able groundwater reserves in arid and semi- arid environments. This process dramati- cally improves the ability of humanitarian and development organisations to identify areas suitable for (temporary and perma- nent) settlement, agriculture and sustainable development. gional geological phenomena. Basic analysis confi rmed that the \u2018Basement Complex\u2019 of Darfur degrades groundwater storage poten- tial, except within alluvial sediments, which are unfortunately prone to rapid evapo- transpiration if not thick enough. Long- term programs to deliver water by tankers to the refugee camps were not sustainable because of long distances and unreliable tracks, lack of security and defi cient bridge infrastructure. Recognising the severity of these chal- lenges and the inadequacy of utilising tra- ditional water exploration drilling methods and in order to meet the above challenges, UNHCR and USAID decided to employ RTF\u2019s WATEX\u00a9 proprietary remote sensing tech- nology. It guided water drilling operations and optimised the location of refugee camps in minimum time. It was developed by RTF to support water exploration in arid and semi-arid areas and exploits the increasing data stream from civilian geospatial technologies to analyse large, heterogeneous climatic and geologic regions for water potential. Several recent trends have made the use of such technology possible: 1. The availability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) earth observation satellite imagery, which provides highly sensitive geological and hydrological intelligence not discern- able through optical imagery. supporting tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees. In Sudan, the study has, in six months, revealed vast stretches of land in central Darfur hosting enough groundwater reserves to sustain 33 million people year round with the Sphere Humanitarian Charter Standards of 15 litres of water per day. The study has also identifi ed 27 micro- dam sites suitable for aquifers sustainability and agriculture. These aquifers are renewable and easily accessible within a depth ranging from sub-surface to 50 m in unconsolidated sediments, which are easy to drill. Challenge and opportunity The response agencies needed to main- tain operations over a region of 300,000 km 2 . Not only was this region undeveloped and largely inaccessible, it was also within a zone of confl ict that affected the security of both refugees and humanitarian relief work- ers. Facing a refugee population that quickly approached 200,000 in Chad and 2.5 million IDPs in Sudan, the authorities needed to dis- cover, develop and deliver massive water re- serves able to sustain water distribution for several years without depleting the natural resources of local communities. This challenge was further complicated by the extreme urgency imposed by the es- calation of the refugee crisis, the limited resources with which to assess hydrological potential and the poor understanding of re- ",

However, even under ideal conditions, the penetration of microwave signals is restricted to near-surface moisture detection, and therefore RTF focused upon the assessment of alluvial water potential along existing wadis and nearby fractures and faults. (Deeper reservoirs can still be detectable if capillary moisture fl ow or satu- rated zone reaches near-surface strata). Large-scale groundwater reserve assessment After the region of interest had been suf- fi ciently mapped, RTF began an assessment of the following fi ve key hydrologic param- eters in order to establish an overall rank of each \u2018water potential anomaly\u2019: 1. Dimension of the radar anomaly, which is an indicator of the potential of a buried aquifer within a wadi . As previously in- dicated, an aquifer with a renewable ca- pability to produce 90,000 m 3 per year is able to support a camp of 20,000 refu- gees. Assuming an average rock porosity of 10 per cent, this implies the need to fi nd a buried aquifer with an overall produc- tion of nearly 1 million m 3 per year. This is equivalent to a wadi reservoir of about 2 km long and 60 m wide, assuming a reservoir thickness of 7.5 m at an average depth of 10-15 m. Accordingly, only radar anomalies Process The radar and optic data acquired by sat- ellite are processed to achieve the project\u2019s overarching goal \u2014 to detect large renewable water reserves capable of supporting refugee settlements of 20,000 per camp, for up to 200,000 Sudanese refugees, in accordance with the UNHCR\u2019s target provision rate of 15 litres per day per person. This automati- cally precluded water exploration of small or non-renewable reserves, and limited anal- ysis to areas of sizeable, renewable water potential. General mapping After interpreting Landsat 7 to determine lithology, weathering processes, vegetation cover, agriculture, settlements, roads/tracks, the SRTM model was used to delineate wa- tersheds, slopes and river profi les, and to es- timate energy level of transportation along wadi (i.e. riverbed) courses. Radar images were processed using WATEX\u00a9 to map fractures, uplifts and sub- sidence, which control river direction and affect groundwater circulation, aquifer thick- ness and storage by reservoir accretion or erosion. WATEX\u00a9 was also applied to enhance the soil volumetric moisture effects of near-sur- face stratum.

Too shallow a slope, and the reservoir can be prone to excessive silt accumulation, compromising its ability to store suffi cient water reserves. Too steep a slope, and the reservoir can be prone to the erosion of the gravel bed that must recharge during the rainy season. Overall suitability assessment The completion of steps 1-5 allows RTF to identify areas of high water potential. In or- der for these areas to be suitable for refugee inhabitation, RTF also considered the impli- cations of refugee resettlement near areas of existing cattle ranching, crop farming, indigenous settlement, etc. In addition to UNHCR-mandated restrictions in Chad on resettlement within 50 km of the Sudan bor- der or other areas of insecurity, RTF favoured potential camp locations that were close to roads and wood fuel sources. Reservoirs/aq- uifers with high suitability were then exam- ined to ensure close proximity to a suitable camp platform, located above the seasonal fl ood plain. (This should be less than 500 m, as recommended by the SPHERE Humanitar- ian Charter Minimum Water Standards). 7 Development of drilling strategy The fi nal step in the project was to iden- tify drilling locations that were away from the central aquifer and towards the edge of the containment fracture. The construction the aquifer determine its ability to reliably absorb and store suffi cient water volumes. WATEX\u00a9 discriminates between \u2018reservoir feeders\u2019 and \u2018reservoir poisoners\u2019. For ex- ample, basaltic rock types create excessive silt and reduce reservoir porosity and per- meability. Alternatively, \u2018reservoir feeders\u2019 such as quartzite and sandstone can pro- duce high-quality gravels. 4. Major fault, since the ideal scenario is an old, well-framed river bed with a reliable and unchanging watercourse, downstream from a high-quality reservoir feeder. A reliable, linear river system controlled by graben-like structures is more likely to con- tain thick, multi-layered reservoirs, partic- ularly if it sits downstream from a source of gravel or water-storing material. 5. Slope of upstream wadi course, since the optimum riverbed slope needs to be be- covering a minimum surface of 12 hectares (2 km x 60 m) were considered by RTF in order to meet the above project goal. At this stage, it is not possible to know if the anomaly is due to a buried aquifer or sur- face moisture linked to clay or silt deposits. More analysis of the short-listed anomalies is required. 2. Amount of upstream watershed drain- age, since each potentially suitable target must also be fed by an upstream water- shed capable of supplying at least 1 mil- lion m 3 per year of water to the reservoir. (The watershed surface area and average annual rainfall were used by RTF to esti- mate total yearly catchment, which was then corrected for estimated losses due to evaporation, erratic run-off, etc.) 3.

In May 2005 UNHCR announced that the site had the capacity to shelter up to 30,000 refugees to the area. The Wadi Dalal settlement of Gaga Camp is about 65 km east of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, and was rec- ommend by RTF because of its exceptional combination of hydrogeologic characteristics respecting the aforementioned fi ve key hy- drologic parameters. In February 2005, prior to UNHCR\u2019s deci- sion to begin construction of the new refu- of well platforms directly in the path of peak wadi fl ow can be catastrophic. By consider- ing the fault structure immediately adjacent to an aquifer but away from the wadi chan- nel, well damage from fl ood-induced erosion can be prevented.

Application of the fi ve hydrologic parameters 1. Size of the radar anomaly: Medium to high amplitude, very big size, indicates important aquifer. 2. Amount of upstream watershed drainage: an exceptionally high yield of 230 million m 3 /year minimum coming from the Azum watershed in Sudan (after removing runoff and evaporation). 3. Quality of the aquifer gravels: migmatites, granites, quartzites and schists provide high quality grains for the aquifers. Good conductivity is expected from future wells. 4. Major faults: this system is well structured by old fractures: alluvial sequences must be thick all along the Bahr Azum alluvial deposits (Lebotigue wells produce more than 30 m 3 per hour throughout the year from 9 to 45 m). 5. Slopes upstream wadi course: with an average of 0.689/100 m the slope is small but due to the water quantities fl owing every year, the energy of transportation remains high enough to clear the silts, leading to a favourable vertical recharge. Conclusion: Bahr Azoum is most likely the most productive site of Eastern Ouadda\u00ef, with sustainable reserves and soils to feed several hundred thousand people. ",

This is the most prolifi c site of Eastern Ouadda\u00ef. It offers a unique combination of groundwater potential and soils which can be the base of the future reconstruction of the economy of Eastern Chad for the benefi t of the local population and for the refugees from Sudan.

Since October 2006, some 300 wells have been drilled thanks to UNICEF with 100 per cent success under the recommendations of RTF\u2019s Darfur Drilling Handbook near the camps of: \u2022 North Darfur near El Fasher: IDP camps of Abu Shouk, Shagra and Mellit; \u2022 South Darfur around IDP camps of Nyala and Kas; and \u2022 West Darfur near El Geneina, on the IDP camps of Riyad, Kereinik, Um Tagouk, Ar- damata, and near the camps of Murnei, Zalingei, Dereisa, Habilah, Ararah, Nyertete and Foto Burunga. The most important yields of 30 m 3 per hour have been recorded within shallow bur- ied aquifers around 30 m deep and the drill- ing effi ciency expressed in cubic metres per metres drilled is 20 times higher inside the recommended WATEX\u00a9-mapped areas than outside. An important drilling success was recorded at greater depths down to 200 m for the UN peacekeeping forces on Shagra wells, in the Nubian sandstones West of El Fasher, as rec- ommended in the Darfur Drilling Handbook. All these results have been monitored and validated by UNESCO (CWR) in Khartoum- Sudan. ",
        "[ 318 ] Conclusions WATEX\u00a9 is an innovative, holistic approach to hydrology, involving a fusion of geological exploration science and geospatial analysis that would not have been possible even just a few years ago and with very limited ground verifi cation only 10 months ago. It has signifi - cantly increased the drilling success rate from 33 per cent to more than 95 per cent on new sustainable aquifers which have been discov- ered after scanning vast stretches of land (over 300,000 km 2 ) between Chad and Sudan. There is always, of course, some level of exploration risk, but in conditions of humani- tarian urgency, timely response, scarce re- sources, security concerns, and inaccessible and massive areas of interest, this system has demonstrated the ability to identify suitable areas for resettlement and meet international standards for water access. In Chad, key evidence of the effi ciency of the WATEX\u00a9 process is UNHCR\u2019s decision to settle a new refugee campsite of Gaga, based on the analysis provided by RTF. UNHCR an- nounced in May 2005 that this site had the capacity to shelter up to 30,000 refugees. RTF\u2019s identifi cation of the most prolifi c site along the Bahr Azum watershed in East- ern Ouadda\u00ef, with a unique combination of groundwater and soils, offers the base of fu- ture reconstruction of Eastern Chad for the benefi t of the local population and for the refugees of Sudan.

The world\u2019s environment ministers made a very clear statement with the UNEP Mal- mo Ministerial Declaration in May 2000: \u2018Environmental threats resulting from the accelerating trends of urbanisation and the development of mega-cities, the tremen- dous risk of climate change, the freshwater crisis and its consequences for food secu- rity and the environment, the unsustain- able exploitation and depletion of biologi- cal resources, drought and desertifi cation, and uncontrolled deforestation, increasing environmental emergencies, the risk to hu- man health and the environment from haz- ardous chemicals, and land-based sources of pollution, are all issues that need to be addressed'. Common sense dictates that we treat these issues as a top priority. But only sud- den events catch our attention. Our soci- eties seem to be led by short-sighted vi- sionaries. There are several reasons for this affl iction. We prefer to avoid trouble. Nobody can be accused of causing tropical cyclones, but it is relatively simple to identify the culprits behind continuous environmental destruction. Government leaders and the senior management of large companies are until the next tragedy takes its place? Our relationship with the media resembles that of a scavenger. The higher the death-toll the bigger the audience. Politicians travel to the scene of a disaster and express their concern for families, but once the tragedy is forgotten what happens to the measures needed to prevent the next disaster? The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station shocked the whole world. But with privatisation of the electrical sector we read more about cutting costs than im- proving the safety of nuclear reactors. The media reported every detail of the wreck of the Kursk submarine and the loss of 118 sailors. But they say nothing of the doz- ens of Russian nuclear submarines slowly rusting in the Barents Sea. Much has been written about the crude oil escaping from the wrecks of Prestige and Erika . Yet every day petrol tankers are voluntarily degas- sing to cut down on cleaning costs, while media and politicians remain largely indif- ferent. Double-hulls are still not compul- sory. Nor is tank cleaning. Over-fi shing affects 72 per cent of our oceans but no regulations are being drafted for interna- tional waters, despite the fact that simple measures \u2014 the introduction of nets with a bigger mesh and a ban on bottom trawl- ing \u2014 would help to prevent depletion of fi sh reserves. These are just a few examples of slow degradation of environmental and A man jumps from a skyscraper and as he passes each fl oor says to himself: \u2018so far so good!\u2019 This sums up our short-sighted way of thinking. Our daily lack of con- cern, let alone action, regarding depletion of natural resources, increasing poverty and poor spatial planning, is a recipe for disaster. We behave carelessly and then we are surprised when things go wrong. Most disasters are not random events without underlying causes. They are the sudden manifestation of slow but continu- ous degradation processes. Risks multiply through lack of concern or our failure to fi nd alternatives. For example, we cannot put all the blame for the death of 2,750 Hai- tians on Hurricane Jeanne. The long proc- ess of deforestation that preceded it was greeted by deafening media silence. Only after the disaster did USA Today write: \u2018The torrents of water that raged down onto this city, killing hundreds of people, are testi- mony to a man-made ecological disaster. Poverty has transformed Haiti\u2019s once ver- dant hills into a moonscape of bedrock rav- aged by ravines\u2019. Would any of the main- stream media have written about Haiti\u2019s 98 per cent deforestation rate before Jeanne struck? Why does slow degradation go unno- ticed?

        "[ 322 ] As long as our main concern is economic growth, we forget that our planet is a fi nite space in which continuous growth is im- possible. We cannot catch more fi sh than the numbers that hatch each year. The same is true of the trees we cut down. Such un- sustainable practices could soon lead to the collapse of entire systems on which a large proportion of the population depends. We can no longer wait for the next disas- ter to happen. We urgently need to reduce the impact of our mismanagement on com- munities and the environment as a whole. It is a huge task but the goal can be achieved. We must stop ongoing degradation of so- ciety and the environment by helping all communities to live on sustainable resourc- es. Priority must be given to renewable energy sources and resources, to support- ing development, and promoting family planning and education. Only then we will see a signifi cant reduction in risks. Our economy will certainly benefi t from this. We cannot afford to postpone investments in our future. Otherwise the bill will just be too high. Our perspective is strictly short-term. To stand a chance of being re-elected politi- cians must focus on what can be achieved in a four to fi ve-year mandate. Long-term issues tend to be sidelined. Our political and economic refl exes prefer quick ben- efi ts, leaving the mess to be cleared up later. We are obsessed with visibility. The me- dia will focus on aid following disasters and government rescue operations. But preventive measures are not attractive enough to make the headlines. Lastly, we imagine natural resources are infi nite, so their price does not refl ect the cost of producing such resources. For ex- ample, there is no such thing as a petrol producer. Bacteria produce petrol. It takes them 200 million years to transform 24.5 tonnes of fern into one litre of crude oil! If we restricted oil consumption to the quantity produced the previous year its price would be stupendous. We can ap- ply the same reasoning to many natural resources. directly responsible for contamination of rivers by mining, erosion following unsus- tainable timber exploitation or soil pollu- tion by industry. But to make such accu- sations against infl uential people is tricky. Putting the emphasis on natural hazards is a much safer attitude. We are fascinated with speed, which makes it diffi cult to make the headlines with continuous degradation. Although the long-term impact may be much worse, the media just will not make a week-long issue of the underlying causes of thousands of people dying of starvation. It is an uphill struggle keeping readers\u2019 and viewers\u2019 at- tention. The media need rapidly changing events to avoid boring their audience. With our blinkered vision, security and the fi ght against terror have monopolised the global debate. Climate change threat- ens millions of people with more frequent heatwaves, rising sea levels, landslides and more severe storms, among others. But combating it will never attract the same amount of funds. ",

UNEP/GRID-Arendal http://www.environmenttimes.net/ But we cannot rule out the impact of cli- mate change on the frequency of hazardous events. Although the number of reported earthquakes is very steady (with an annu- al range of 20-40 events), the number of reported floods and cyclones increases dramatically over time (a correlation of R2 = 0.81 and 0.64, respectively, compared with 0.25 for earthquakes). If the fl ow of information was increasing the number of reported earthquakes would be increasing too. But if tectonic events are steady and cli- matic events on the increase, there is cause for serious concern about the impacts of climate change on the frequency of associ- ated hazards. If the scientists can demonstrate that glo- bal warming is causing higher casualty rates then countries facing higher risks may de- cide to sue the largest CO 2 producers to cover the extra cost of adaptation. It is equally possible that families of the victims of tropi- cal cyclones may sue them for gross negli- gence. The failure to introduce measures to combat global warming may rebound, with victims sending in the bill much as they did in the United States when they took the to- bacco industry to court. formation worldwide. How, the reader may ask, do we know that? The number of earthquakes (of suffi cient magnitude to register on a seismograph) that hit populated areas has not increased; rather it is steady. But EM-DAT only reported some of them. In the 1970s only 11 per cent of earthquakes affecting human settlements were reported. The fi gure for the 1980-1992 period increased sharply reaching 25 per cent. It carried on rising, to 31 per cent be- tween 1993-2003. Demographic factors can- not explain the sudden increase in reporting. The most logical explanation is the tremen- dous improvement in information technol- ogy. By the end of the 1970s the media had achieved global coverage. For the fi rst time television channels broadcast live cover- age of a war (in Vietnam). Before 1980 only places with a powerful information network supplied data on events involving natural hazards and only major disasters were likely to be reported. The second sharp increase appears in the mid-1990s (circa 1995). The emergence of the internet as a global means of informa- tion access immediately springs to mind. With growing populations and infrastruc- tures the world\u2019s exposure to natural hazards is inevitably increasing. This is particularly true as the strongest population growth is lo- cated in coastal areas (with greater exposure to fl oods, cyclones and tidal waves). To make matters worse any land remaining available for urban growth is generally risk-prone, for instance fl ood plains or steep slopes subject to landslides. Studies of this reveal an ex- ponential increase in disasters. This raises several questions: is the increase due to a signifi cant improvement in access to infor- mation? What part does population growth and infrastructure development play? Final- ly, is climate change behind the increasing frequency of natural hazards? As it seems less likely for tectonic haz- ards (such as earthquakes, volcanoes) to be infl uenced by climate trends we may take them as a benchmark. If we look at data from EM-Dat1, the only publicly available global database on the impact of hazards on humans, we can see that the occurrence of reported earthquakes is increasing along similar lines to other hazards. The increase is certainly exponential but mainly due to a signifi cant improvement in access to in- I S CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF HAZARDOUS EVENTS ?

This type of tailored information, if de- livered in a timely fashion, can be an in- valuable asset in planning and prioritising locations for needs assessments, not to men- tion providing huge cost and time savings. For example, obtaining initial impact as- sessments in a natural disaster by conduct- ing a visual survey from a helicopter costs an organisation many thousands of dollars. Helicopters alone rent for approximately US $6,000 each per hour. The current use of remote sensing and GIS, carries virtually no cost to WFP, and has provided extremely valuable information during a time when there is normally an information vacuum. WFP has recently tested this technology in West Africa, and found that it was extremely useful in supporting decisions about where to undertake needs assessments. The map- ping outputs have also been used in several cases for operational planning, especially with regard to pre-positioning food stocks where needs are anticipated, and establish- ing logistics corridors based on information about damage to infrastructure. When an early warning alert is issued about signifi cant fl ooding or a hurricane, A key challenge still facing WFP is how to link its preparedness systems with decision- making and how to encourage anticipatory action and preparedness at all levels in a timely way. This year, through several pilot projects with leading academic and technical institutions, WFP has taken the opportunity to enhance its capacity to anticipate food se- curity crises and launch rapid needs assess- ments, especially in natural disasters, using advanced Geographical Information Systems (GIS), high resolution satellite imagery and other forms of remote sensing. Early warning and early impact analysis WFP is building its capacity to anticipate and respond to sudden-onset natural disas- ters, including any brought on by extreme weather patterns, possibly linked to global climate change. In 2007, WFP started to de- velop a network of partnerships with aca- demic research institutions, governments and UN agencies working in applied tech- nology (remote sensing, GIS). Particularly notable is a partnership between WFP, the Polytechnic University of Turin (Politecnico di Torino) and the Higher Institute on Inno- vation Territorial Systems (SiTI). This joint project called ITHACA (Information Technol- ogy for Humanitarian Assistance Coopera- tion and Action) is establishing historical data patterns, developing forecasting mod- Introduction: WFP and preparedness Increasingly the World Food Programme (WFP) is being called on to respond to hun- ger in the context of a wide range of emer- gencies, from natural disasters like the tsu- nami tragedy in Asia to manmade crises such as the ongoing civil confl ict in Darfur, Sudan. In 2006, WFP emergency operations provided food aid for 63.4 million people caught up in the ever-widening net of hu- manitarian disasters. To respond success- fully to emergencies entailing food shortages WFP must be able to mobilise its response quickly and effi ciently, making prepared- ness a critical component of any emergency operation. In recent years, WFP has developed and adopted methodologies and tools for emer- gency preparedness including a dedicated preparedness unit at its headquarters, estab- lishing a global Early Warning Monitoring Service, mainstreaming the practice of Con- tingency Planning in its country offi ces, and creating internal and external web-based information platforms to share key prepar- edness documents, maps and data. WFP also maintains an active role in promoting pre- paredness, early warning and \u2018early action\u2019, through co-chairing the UN humanitarian Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) sub-working group on Contingency Plan- ning and Preparedness.

The alert was posted on WFP\u2019s Emergency Preparedness and Response in- tranet, EPWeb, and disseminated via email to its list of email subscribers. 14 November 2007 WFP Early Warning picked up additional reports noting that tropical cyclone Sidr was due to make landfall as a Category-4 Storm on 15 November around 20:00 hours GMT close to the India-Bangladesh border between West Bengal and Khulna. Reports were confi rmed at fi eld level. According to the WFP offi ce in Dhaka, the cyclone\u2019s im- pact was potentially devastating, especially in the south-west of the country because of extensive fl ooding from exceptional rain- fall. Early Warning indicated that analysts feared the cyclone would cause severe dam- age along coastal areas of Bangladesh, east- ern India and Myanmar. WFP Bangladesh GIS and the Remote Sensing focal point in the country offi ce were contacted by the preparedness unit in HQ to discuss the best analysis. The CO sug- gested priority areas, based on fi eld experi- ence and additional data, thereby guiding the focus of the remote-sensing analysis. At 10:00 hours, the GIS team at WFP HQ produced the fi rst maps of potentially af- fected areas based on the forecast typhoon path, including the number of people living in the cyclone corridor who would be affect- ed by high wind speeds. This map was sent lustrates WFP\u2019s coordination of analytical and mapping functions and dissemination of practical early warning information and early impact analysis for the operational re- sponse. The timeline below looks at WFP\u2019s early warning and early impact activities during the days leading up to the storm making landfall, as well as the fi rst 48 hours post-impact. While WFP\u2019s early warning early-impact activities were just a compo- nent of a wider preparedness and response framework involving a broad range of UN, government and NGO actors, the agency\u2019s experience piloting remote sensing and GIS technologies in this case further indicates the great potential value obtained from us- ing these forms of applied sciences in hu- manitarian emergencies. In the case of Sidr, WFP\u2019s activities both pre- and immediately post-impact also established a network of actors that continued the critical situational awareness and mapping support to opera- tions, including ongoing mapping updates on road damage in the affected areas. Cyclone Sidr timeline 12 November 2007 WFP\u2019s Early Warning global service issued an alert based on information from the Bangladesh Disaster Management In- formation Centre, Tropical Storm Risk and other weather and news sources that tropi- cal storm Sidr had formed over the Bay of Bengal south-west of the Andaman Islands and was moving north-westwards. Sidr was forecast to strengthen to a Category-2 Storm by 14 November and was expected to af- specialised analysts are mobilised within hours through the ITHACA partnership to analyse the satellite images. The analysis and mapping products produced by the ITH- ACA team are developed at no cost, spe- cifi cally for WFP\u2019s operational needs. The analytical process requires new, timely im- age acquisitions, although historical data is also needed to detect changes. To acquire, process and analyse the satellite images and disseminate the mapping outputs quickly for WFP staff on the ground, the Remote Sensing partners have established a net- work between image providers, analysts and users. The main source of the images are satellites owned by governmental space agencies, which publicly disseminate images or provide ad hoc acquisitions at no cost to WFP through bilateral and multilateral agreements. Case study of preparedness in action: Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh The above tools and methodologies have been piloted for fl oods during 2007 in Pa- kistan, Mozambique and, most recently, in West and East Africa, where the mapping has supported WFP emergency assessments and was shared with governments and in- ter-agency partners. The essential elements of the approach are timeliness, continuing optimisation of information and outputs ac- cording to user needs, and the close coordi- nation of internal and external actors.

The con- tinuing support from HQ dealt mainly with obtaining images through the International Space Charter as well as bilateral agreements with national space agencies. Data from sat- ellites started to arrive on 18 November and the next day the fi rst analyses were shared with the fi eld. These were also used during conference calls between HQ, the regional bureau and country offi ce. Five WFP assessment teams left Jessore fi eld offi ce at 07:45 hours when the all- clear signal was given. The fi rst WFP con- voy set out at 13:00 hours with 20 Metric tonnes (MT) of biscuits to feed 100,000 peo- ple. Follow-up convoys were prepared for the afternoon and the following day to pro- vide an additional 300,000 people with 80 MT of biscuits. An additional 100 MT was made available from the Bangladesh coun- try program. Conclusion The forward-looking alerts, coupled with the data and analysis obtained through re- mote sensing translated into practical maps that served the needs of the country offi ce in establishing early on priorities for under- taking needs assessments and operational decision-making. From the pre-positioning of food, to establishing where needs assess- ments should be undertaken, to providing essential information about damaged infra- structure to our logistics staff on the ground \u2014 the use of Remote Sensing and GIS holds would then perform additional analysis as per WFP/ITHACA procedures. 15 November 2007 The storm hit the coast of Bangladesh as a Category 4 (5 being the highest) and was downgraded to Category 2 on moving to- wards the centre of the country. After discussing with the country offi ce the previous day\u2019s outputs, WFP\u2019s prepared- ness unit agreed that the simulation model was oversimplifi ed and might not yield reli- able information. Feedback was sent to ITH- ACA, which produced a revised model for fl ood-prone areas. Two additional maps, giving updates on potentially affected areas, were produced by the preparedness unit and disseminated. 16 November 2007 The preparedness unit support shifted from primarily forecasting to providing informa- tion to WFP operations. ITHACA issued a map at 10:00 hours Rome time, indicat- ing potentially fl ooded areas based on the revised modelling methodology. At 12:00 hours, the information management team activated a Crisis Monitoring page dedicat- ed to the situation, so that WFP staff could access all the maps, along with the key op- erational data and documents related to the emergency. Meanwhile the country offi ce, now well into its early response phase, issued a situ- to the country offi ce. At 13:00 hours, the team produced another map giving hazard level, mortality and economic risk indica- tors from historical records. Also, on the day before impact, the ITH- ACA team ran a simulation model to iden- tify fl ood-prone areas and produced a map. (N.B.: this modelling methodology is a pro- totype and is being refi ned). The Bangladesh case modelling was shared with the country offi ce for preliminary validation. Acquiring images quickly was a major concern before the storm actually hit. WFP requested the triggering of the International Charter Space and Major Disasters based on information received from the Bangladesh offi ce, with technical backup from ITHACA. However, the Space Charter refused to book the satellite before the fl ood as only post- shock activations are currently allowed. To obtain imagery before the event, WFP reached a bilateral agreement with the Ital- ian Space Agency (ISA), which agreed to ac- quire images for WFP through their COSMO Skymed satellite and transfer the images to ITHACA for analysis. Additionally, WFP together with UNOSAT requested and endorsed the assistance of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the GMES RESPOND project. The ENVISAT sat- ellite was booked for the time during which fl ooding was expected to peak (Friday- Saturday). It was agreed that the processed data would be provided to ITHACA, which ",

Additionally, this case and other recent experiences underscore the importance of having an active network of technical part- ners for the timely acquisition and analysis of the satellite images. Whereas the Charter activation suited delivery of images post- event, WFP also relied on its bilateral rela- tionship with the Italian Space Agency in order to obtain images pre-event for fore- casting purposes.

People and politicians began calling it an environ- mental catastrophe. Neighbouring countries, namely Bulgaria and Romania, expressed their deep concern about the possible toxic sludge in the Danube and trans-boundary air pollution. Meanwhile, NATO argued that the environmental damage was minimized by the use of sophisticated weapons and se- lective targeting. So, what was the truth? This is where UNEP came in \u2014 using environmental ex- perts, mobile labs and satellite images, we pieced together the risks and the environ- mental legacy. Even though the fi rst causal- ity of war is truth, the samples of air, soil, and water do not lie. UNEP\u2019s fi rst report con- cluded that the damage was not as bad as people fi rst thought. High concentrations of chemicals were identifi ed at four main hotspots, but the overall situation could not be called a catastrophe. However, a clean up at the four hotspots was needed to protect health and the environment from further risks. The clean-up was considered an urgent humanitarian priority. This example makes the link between environmental damage and human health clear. Since Kosovo, we\u2019ve done similar work in Iraq, looking at the risks posed by the 50 oil fi res during 2003, as well as at some ing of the factories and industrial sites that NATO referred to as \u201cstrategic targets\u201d. To cite one example, the Pancevo industrial site was hit 12 separate times during the confl ict. Some 80,000 tonnes of burning oil were re- leased into the environment. Black rain fell onto neighbouring towns and villages. If you need a way to visualize what 80,000 tonnes of oil looks like, consider that one oil tanker truck holds 20 tonnes. We are there- fore talking about 4,000 oil tankers spilled during the war in one single site alone. In addition, a toxic soup of compounds and substances leaked into the air, soil and wa- ter around Pancevo, including 2,100 tonnes of ethylene dichloride (a substance causing kidney, liver and adrenal damage), 8 tonnes of metallic mercury (known to cause severe birth defects and brain damage), 460 tonnes of vinyl chloride monomer (a known human carcinogen and a source of dioxins when burned) and fi nally 250 tonnes of liquid am- monia (which can cause blindness, lung dis- ease and death). In total, another 140 tankers of chemicals. Remember that this is only a single site among more than 50 industrial sites that were hit. How was this environmental disaster tackled? Imagine if this happened next to where you live. What would you feel? You would most probably be wondering if the air safe to breathe. If the water is safe to drink. If the What do we know about the environmental dimensions of confl icts and disasters? UNEP has been conducting detailed as- sessments on the environmental impacts of confl icts since 1999 and disasters since 2005. To date we\u2019ve operated in 25 crisis-affect- ed countries and mobilised US $75 million towards environmental assessment and re- covery. UNEP\u2019s role is to use science and technology to determine the environmental damage caused by confl icts and disasters and to assess the impact this damage may have on humans. UNEP can then provide assist- ance to address the environmental damage \u2014 either in terms of site clean up or restora- tion or through capacity-building of envi- ronmental authorities. In the last eight years of our post-crisis operations, we have learned two critical les- sons that are relevant for today\u2019s discussions. First, confl ict and disasters always cause en- vironmental damage; while the types and magnitude of damage differ, there are always impacts. Second, this damage affects humans in three specifi c ways: it threatens health, it threatens human livelihoods and it threatens human security. In which way do you mean that confl ict causes environmental damage? Go back to 1999 \u2014 the Kosovo confl ict. What do you see? Most will recall the streams of refugees fl eeing Kosovo \u2014 500,000 in to- tal, but some might also recall the bomb- \u2018E NVIRONMENTAL NEEDS IN POST - CRISIS ASSESSEMENTS AND RECOVERY \u2019 I NTERVIEW WITH D AVID J ENSEN David Jensen heads the Policy and Planning Team of the UN Environment Programme's Post-Confl ict and Disaster Management Branch in Geneva, Switzerland.

        "[ 330 ] What about the link between environmen- tal damage and security? How do you see the risk of confl icts rising out of the ashes of natural disasters? Most people don\u2019t realize that natural resources can act as buffers against natu- ral hazards, thereby reducing their impact. For example, coastal mangroves forests, sea grasses, and coral reefs absorb some of the energy of coastal hazards thereby reducing overall impacts. As we saw in the wake of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand, the loss of these coastal resources makes coastal vil- lages more vulnerable to natural hazards. New Orleans also learned this lesson all too well. A similar lesson was also learned in Pakistan. Removing forest cover from steep slopes can have a catastrophic impact dur- ing an earthquake, as unstable soils can slide right off the mountainside. So, in a post- crisis situation, we also need to assess if key resources were damaged and if this dam- age could somehow increase vulnerability to disasters. On the other side, we need to understand if access to critical resources such as land and water or high-value resources such as timber and minerals was changed in such a way that could cause confl ict. For example, one could point to DR Congo \u2014 which I have recently returned from \u2014 where high-value natural resources in the east are now again fuelling confl ict. They are controlled by various mi- litias who fi ght with each other, with local communities and with the government over control. Therefore, the resources themselves impact. What do I mean? I led a team look- ing at the conditions of forests in Afghani- stan. In some areas, we found that up to 95% of the landscape had been deforested during the confl ict. It was cut for fuel, it was bombed to remove cover and it was removed to grow crops and for grazing. Many people say to me: \u201cwell that\u2019s sad but at the end of the day who really cares?\u201d How about the people that use the forest for fuel wood for heating and cooking? How about the people that need timber for shelter? How about the people that used to collect nuts and seeds to sell at the market? In fact, what we found was that many livelihoods were fundamen- tally dependant on these forests. Without them, and without alternatives, they were being displaced to cities or engaging in other forms of income generation such as poppy production for the drug trade. But Afghanistan taught us something much more important about the impact of confl ict \u2014 at the end of the day what caused the deforestation was survival com- bined with a complete breakdown in gov- ernance. This breakdown not only affected forest management, which I can assure you did exist prior to 1979, but also local sys- tems for water, wildlife and land manage- ment \u2014 all destroyed leading to a free for all situation and major environmental damage across the country. Following Afghanistan, we had a new un- derstanding and approach. Environmental damage can affect livelihoods, cause dis- placement, and fundamentally undermine stability and peacebuilding. of the industrial sites that were bombed or looted. In one former arms manufacturing site, called Al Qadissiya, UNEP teams found nearly 100 tonnes of toxic abandoned chem- icals including sodium cyanide and hex- avalent chromium. Again, fi ve oil tanker trucks worth. You may know that adding water to sodium cyanide creates hydro- gen cyanide \u2014 the lethal substance used in a gas chamber. Meanwhile, those that have watched the American film \u2018Erin Brockovich' will know that hexavalent chro- mium is highly toxic causing mutations in DNA and making your teeth turn yellow and fall out. The fact that both substances were found in the open is not only a health risk, but also a major security risk if they had fallen into the wrong hands. So the environment and health analysis makes sense when you have a short-duration war in highly industrialized locations using sophisticated weapons. What about the environmental impact in other confl icts and civil wars? I am think- ing now about situations such as Afghani- stan, Liberia, Sudan and DR Congo where the infrastructure is not as advanced as in the Balkans. Take Afghanistan as an example. Afghan- istan was the fi rst time UNEP dealt with the linkage between environmental dam- age and livelihoods. In Afghanistan, there was virtually no heavy infrastructure. There was nothing to be bombed and no specifi c sites to be assessed. But 23 years of confl ict had a much deeper and more fundamental ",
        "[ 331 ] be more important than human survival, but only that these impacts could easily be avoided by the use of energy effi cient stoves coupled with sustainably produced wood from woodlots for example. If one of the key humanitarian principles is \u201cdo no harm\u201d, this should equally apply to the environ- ment. Another recent example comes from Darfur where groundwater aquifers are be- ing pumped above sustainable levels to meet urgent needs. While this may be a short-term solution, what are the medium term impli- cations for local communities that also rely on the groundwater? Wouldn\u2019t loss of those aquifers lead to another crisis or potential confl ict. Is this smart? Can\u2019t we do better? Now, when it comes to the recovery proc- ess itself, we face similar challenges. The post-confl ict period represents a massive injection of capital and a fl urry of rebuild- ing activity. About 6 to 20 times more aid per capita is received following a disaster or confl ict. As a result, the natural resources that are normally consumed for example over a 5 to 10 year period are consumed in a year in a post-crisis setting. We call this hyper-development and while it is not yet fully quantifi ed, it is possible that more en- vironmental damage actually happens dur- ing the reconstruction process than in the confl ict or disaster itself. The reason is sim- ple: in the rush to rebuild infrastructure and restore economies, there often isn\u2019t time for planning, environmental safeguards, and wise decisions on the sustainable use of re- sources. Political pressure dictates immediate and visible progress. This is precisely why an both as a cross-cutting issue and as a sector. If it is only cross-cutting it tends to be lost. If it is only a sector, the other sectors tend to neglect it. Therefore, a twin approach as we saw in Haiti or Somalia is needed. We expect the Post-Disaster Needs As- sessment (PDNA) to perform a similar role, and UNEP is currently taking the lead for developing the environmental assessment module within the Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery (CWGER). However, as we use this opportunity to critically refl ect on the PCNA and PDNA processes, UNEP can say that both tools must begin to look beyond environmental damage caused by the con- fl ict or disaster in order to take a sustainable approach to recovery planning. Isn\u2019t there also a risk that the relief opera- tions themselves result in an environmental impact? In terms of relief operations, I\u2019m just back from DR Congo where recent fi ghting in North Kivu has lead to the displacement of around 60,000 people into fi ve camps for internally displaced persons (IDP) near the boarder of Virunga National Park. Virunga Park is one of the last two places on earth where mountain gorillas can still be found. In the camps, we have a typical situation where food, water, and shelter are considered essential needs and are being provided by relief agencies. But when it comes to energy for heating and cooking, the IDPs are left to fend for themselves. Of course, the supply comes primarily from the park. Now, I am not saying that conservation needs should have become security threats. In this regard, immediate management of these resources is fundamental to peacebuilding and stability. What does UNEP do to aid in these issues? In addition to assessing environmental damage, UNEP also evaluates the capacity of affected governments at the local and na- tional levels to actually respond to identifi ed impacts and needs. What we\u2019ve found is that in most post-confl ict situations, environ- mental institutions are either non-existent or non-functional, and therefore incapable of putting environmental needs on the political agenda. In post-disaster situations, they are likewise often weak and struggle for a politi- cal voice and infl uence. UNEP has therefore played a key role in assessing their capac- ity, strengthening their hand, and providing technical and political backstopping in the weeks and months following a crisis. What can be done to improve the global response to environmental disasters and se- curity threats? In terms of assessing and addressing envi- ronmental damage, the Post-Confl ict Needs Assessment (PCNA) has emerged as a criti- cal tool in post-confl ict countries. UNEP has been involved in all six PCNAs so far and has tried to identify key environmental risks and needs. By integrating these issues in the PCNA, UNEP\u2019s aim is to fully integrate envi- ronment within the recovery and peacebuild- ing process. But the key lesson in the PCNA is that the environment should be treated ",
        "[ 332 ] homes. All of these risks could have been prevented with better planning and on-the- ground technical advice. In my fi nal example, I\u2019d like to highlight the importance of understanding the region- al dimension in recovery. Rwanda\u2019s 2006 policy decision to ban charcoal production provides an important lesson. While the pol- icy may have been effectively implemented in Rwanda, charcoal production and supply shifted to neighbouring DR Congo thereby further increasing extractive pressures, in- cluding on the Virunga National Park and World Heritage Site. So, I\u2019ve talked about using the early re- covery process as an opportunity to look ahead and re-orient countries towards more sustainable forms of development. At the same time, we must also look to the past to understand how environmental degradation actually contributed to the confl ict or disas- ter in the fi rst place. What needs to be done for the future in order to ensure more successes like these? In my mind, one of the issues that the in- ternational community has not yet success- fully addressed relates to the underlying root causes of disasters and confl icts. This goes to the heart of the prevention issue. In this regard, there is a fundamental link between environmental management and vulnerabil- ity to confl icts and disasters. I\u2019ve already mentioned the tsunami, New Orleans and Pakistan disasters, but I want to fi rmly and clearly emphasize that better management of natural resources would have actually energy for the Maldives. And fi nally, in Ban- da Aceh, Indonesia, efforts are being under- taken to prevent groundwater contamination from household sewage by installing sep- tic tanks and leach fi elds. Another example from Banda Aceh is that a signifi cant por- tion of the debris waste was recycled \u2014 the timber was transformed into furniture and the concrete became road foundation. Unfor- tunately, for every positive case, I can prob- ably list nine where new environmental risks and impacts are being created due to poor planning. For example, back in Aceh, there was a massive fl urry to replant mangroves in order to provide protection from future hazards. In total, 30 million seedlings have been planted. However, 95 per cent were the same species \u2014 making the new forests a monoculture and highly vulnerable to dis- ease. Also, incredibly, earthquake standards were not used in rebuilding thousands of new homes: they had to be retrofi tted af- ter this critical lapse was discovered. What makes this even more appalling is that In- donesia has earthquake standards that were not followed. This is a good example of not understanding local context, laws, and risks coupled with low institutional capacity for legal enforcement. Moving on to the Maldives, they tried to take the right approach in terms of crush- ing and recycling debris waste into building materials for new homes. The only problem is that they did not realize the previous roof- ing was asbestos. The asbestos was crushed releasing carcinogen fi bres into the air and then embedding within the walls of future early recovery approach is so critical. Early recovery thinking must already begin in a humanitarian setting \u2014 if it happens only when recovery starts, it is already too late. The PDNA is a critical tool for defi ning en- vironmental needs from an early recovery perspective. As I have mentioned, UNEP is currently working with UNDP to develop and test an environmental module. At the end of the day the PDNA process and the early recovery plan should help to re-orient the country towards more sustainable forms of development and to reduce underlying risks of all forms. Of course, we are not saying not to use the resources, only to ensure they are used in sustainable ways \u2014 in ways that help to build back better rather than doing more harm and increasing vulnerability. Has this already been done? Can you men- tion some examples? I can think of many positive examples coming from the tsunami-affected countries where environmental needs were seriously considered in the recovery process. In Sri Lanka, the NGO Practical Action is help- ing to commercialise a new bio-gas scheme to provide alternative forms of energy. The government is also in the process of iden- tifying environmentally sound locations for landfi lls. In the Maldives, the Safe Islands Programme was developed as part of the rebuilding process. This has involved as- sessing risks from sea level rise and ensuring re-building does not take place in vulner- able areas. The Clinton Initiative also tried to catalyse major investments in alternative ",

In phase two, we will do more detailed en- vironmental assessments integrated within the PCNA / PDNA process which look at environmental damage and risks to heath, livelihoods, and security. The assessments should also look ahead at building back better, as well as behind in terms of un- derstanding the root causes of the event. Cross-cutting the analysis would be gov- ernance capacity at the national and local levels. All agencies that collect relevant en- vironmental data would feed it into a single shared database. UNEP would be systemati- cally included in each assessment or del- egate the roll to a sister UN agency that is better suited for a specifi c situation. Within the assessments and early recovery plans, it would be essential to build in environ- mental indicators and monitoring metrics so that progress can be objectively monitored and that all actors can be held accountable. UNEP could also be involved down the road in terms of monitoring and evaluating the environmental performance of the recovery process itself. Thirdly, following the PCNA / PDNA, UNEP needs to develop capacity to ensure that environmental technical assistance is available to agencies struggling with en- vironmental issues. What specifi c envi- ronmental technologies can be used and what is best practice. What are the key risks that should be considered? UNEP would of water change? Which regions will dry out, which regions will be completely fl ooded, and what is the potential for confl ict? What do the predicted increases in the frequency and intensity of storms and weather-related hazards mean for disasters? How should we be planning to take this into account? Where are the hotspots and what do they need to prepare and adapt? What are UNEP\u2019s priorities for the future in addressing the environmental dimension of confl icts and disasters? Our vision fi rst begins with prevention and risk reduction. We need to start identi- fying on a more systematic basis countries that are vulnerable to confl icts and disas- ters from poor natural resource manage- ment. In particular, fragile states where we can build natural resources management capacity and crisis preparedness. We also need to see things from a climate change perspective, understanding which regions will be affected, how, and what the impli- cations for disaster and confl ict risk will be. We do not currently have this capacity and need to build it. Secondly, if a confl ict or disaster does occur, then UNEP will conduct its response assessment in two phases using existing ca- pacities. In phase one, UNEP and OCHA will conduct a rapid environmental assessment of critical threats to human life and health from the release of hazardous substances in a confl ict or disaster. Basically, things that can kill you today or tomorrow. What this means is a more systematic deployment of reduced the overall damage that was sus- tained from the hazards. On the confl ict side, since 1990 there have been 17 major confl icts that have centred on the exploitation of natural resources \u2014 nine of these were in Africa. Paul Collier\u2019s recent book, \u2018The Bottom Billion' looks at 40 years of instability and concludes that high-value natural resources have been a critical desta- bilizing factor \u2014 acting as more of a curse than a blessing. Natural resources can be both a trigger and a source for funding wars and war economies. In this regard, the EC has played a fundamental role through the Kimberly Process to stem the fl ow of confl ict diamonds, for example. More is needed for timber and other minerals. Further strength- ening of the Kimberly Process is also needed, as Global Witness reports that confl ict dia- monds funds the current instability in the Ivory Coast. UNEP\u2019s recent post-confl ict assessment in Sudan also points out that the scarcity of natural resources, particularly land and water, is a critical factor in the Darfur con- fl ict. So we know there is a fundamental connection between natural resources and confl ict. What we haven\u2019t yet done very well is focus resources on building capacity to govern these resources in fragile states. At the same time, we have not done enough to prepare countries for the recovery process following a confl ict or disaster. And what we need to start thinking about more than ever is the impact that climate change could have on natural resources and climatic haz- ards. In particular, how will the distribution ",

We are also planning to work with Care International to mainstream en- vironment in humanitarian relief and across the cluster approach. Most of these partner- ships are in the embryonic stage and need to be expanded and matured. The one miss- ing element in this list is the private sec- tor. There is a fundamental need to engage them in this discussion, with a possible en- try-point through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). What role do you see EU having in the work on addressing the environmental di- mension of confl icts and disasters? The EU\u2019s Stability Instrument and Peace- building Partnership present a major op- portunity to address the issues I have just outlined. UNEP sees the European Commis- sion as a major partner in implementing the vision through a combination of political leverage, technical expertise, and fi nancial resources. We have the facts, we have the experts, we have the momentum: now is the time to truly integrate environmental issues within the overall meaning of stability and sustain- able development. This is not something we can achieve alone, which is why I would en- courage cooperation with UNEP to develop a common vision and achieve a shared set of goals. It is like the old African proverb that says a lot about partnerships: \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d allow us to achieve the vision I have set out above. However, UNEP cannot and should not act alone. We need partners. Political partners technical partners, national part- ners and fi nancial partners. In this regard, we are already working with the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) and the World Bank to in- clude environmental management tools in risk reduction and to identify global risks from natural hazards. We are seconding an expert to the Peacebuilding Commission Support Offi ce to provide expertise and best practice on natural resources management in post-confl ict countries. We are working within the UN country teams and UNDP to implement environmental recovery pro- grammes in Afghanistan, Sudan, Sri Lanka, DR Congo, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Nepal. We are partnering with the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Woodrow Wilson Center, the Universities of Maryland, Duke, and California and Glo- bal Witness in developing analytical tools on environment and confl ict for the PCNA and the Peacebuilding Commission. We are working with Environmental Law Institute and the International Union for Conserva- tion of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) to identify best practice on natural resource management in post-confl ict countries. We are providing advice to the Capstone Policy of the Department of Peacekeeping Opera- tions (DPKO). We are a member of the Inter- national Recovery Platform and the Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery and are maintain a trained roster of experts and de- ploy specialists on an as needed basis. The specialists would collect lessons learned and feed them into a global database on best and worst practices. Fourthly, in some post-crisis situations, UNEP will need to establish an in-country project to provide targeted capacity build- ing assistance to national environmental authorities. For example, like we have done in Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq, Sudan, and Sri Lanka. We provide training and techni- cal assistance in terms of developing and implementing laws and policies. The fi fth priority is for UNEP to build fur- ther capacity in using shared natural re- sources as platforms for peacebuilding and confl ict prevention. In the European Re- gion, UNEP has been piloting activities with UNDP, NATO, and OSCE called the Envi- ronmental Security Initiative. Good lessons have been learnt at the regional level, and it is now time to scale up the services, in particular to Africa. UNEP plans to expand these efforts to the global level, starting with post-confl ict countries in Africa. I would like to add that UNEP is going through a long overdue major internal re- form process. The reforms will focus our work into fi ve core areas, instil a results- based management approach, and make us more relevant at the national level. Within the discussions, addressing the environmen- tal dimensions of confl icts and disasters is being proposed by our senior management team as one of the core topics. This would ",

        "[ 365 ] Introduction The international community\u2019s growing concern with security has generated a re- newed and obvious interest in systems to provide warnings and forecasts of crises and confl icts. These can no longer be un- derstood in terms of the relatively simple paradigm of the Cold War. These are jointly known as \u2018early warning systems', able to improve the action capabilities, in particular for preventative action, of both the interna- tional community and its member states. In a world increasingly seen as a glo- balized, it has become more diffi cult to ignore the effects of wars or disasters even though in some cases they are unfolding thousands of kilometres away. The col- lapse of a state, or a civil war, can destroy past efforts in terms of economic develop- ment, can destabilize an entire region, re- duce business markets and sources of supply and destroy their industrial investments. It can also signifi cantly disturb raw material and energy markets. It can involve fl oods of refugees creating, in turn, immigration problems and generate a favourable breed- ing ground for hostile thinking, which may D EVELOPING AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR CRISES Dr H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lavoix currently works as an independent researcher and consultant, specialising in strategic early warning, confl ict prevention, genocide and Eastern Asia. She carries out studies and contributes to seminars, workshops, mainly for state actors (especially the French government), quasi-state actors and with research centres, such as CERI-Sciences Po and Ifri. She has contributed to international conferences, such as the 2007 Canadian Association for Security and Intelligence Studies (CASIS) and a series of seminars like \u2018Strategic Foresight and Warning \u2014 Emerging Threats in the 21 st Century\u2019, organised by the Centre for Security Studies, Zurich (ETH/CSS). She has published on strategic early warning, indicators, fragile states and genocide. Prior to this, she served as an analyst in international relations for the European Commission and created and headed the Cambodian branch of a development NGO during and after the UN peacebuilding mission (1992-1994). then be refl ected in terrorist acts in far-off lands, thus enlarging the theatre of war to cover the entire world. In addition, there are purely altruistic concerns, which may also motivate members of the international community. 1 These altruistic concerns led to a number of interventions, usually made once the crisis had begun, aimed at minimising its direct and indirect effects. Such actions, however, are not only inadequate but also extremely burdensome, whereas, in view of the risk, taking no action may not always be an option. Besides, Jack Straw, former British Foreign Secretary, stressed that the intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina, al- though it was not able to prevent the civil war or the ethnic massacres, cost the British taxpayer at least \u00a31.5 billion, whereas the cost of preventative action in Macedonia only amounted to \u00a314 million. 2 The aid to Rwanda during the three years following the genocide amounted to over US $2 bil- lion, whereas a preventative intervention would certainly have made it possible to avoid this human tragedy at a cost approxi- mately a third of that amount. 3 We should therefore make the shift from a reactive strategy to a preventative one, including identifi cation of the signs of cri- ses and, therefore, suffi ciently early antici- pation 4 \u2014 i.e. an operational early warn- ing system \u2014 to make it possible to set off an alarm, to provide a detailed diagnosis following the alert, a decision to inter- vene, planning, and implementation of the response. However, there is another pitfall. Inter- ventions, even preventative ones, are some- times ineffective or, worse yet, counter- productive. For example, not only is the preventative nature of the war in Iraq con- ducted by the coalition subject to question, but so are its effects, particularly in terms of destruction of the machinery of the State contributing to the civil war. Prevention and early warning systems therefore need to be based on an understanding of the mecha- nisms giving rise to the situations that one is attempting to prevent. I will fi rst of all give an introduction to the prevention process as a whole, thus lo- cating early warning systems within their 1 With regard to \u201cmixed\u201d motivations, both altruistic and otherwise, that give rise to certain actions, reference may be made, in the case of wars, to Michael Walzer, Guerres justes et injustes : argumentation morale avec exemples historiques , Paris, Gallimard, 2006. 2 Speech by Jack Straw, British Foreign Secretary, at the Foreign Policy Centre, 25 March 2002. 3 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Confl ict, December 1997, <www.carnegie.org/sub/research/> quoting Rebuilding Post-War Rwanda, The International Response to Confl ict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience , Study 4, Copenhagen: Steering Committee of the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda, March 1996, p. 32, and Michael E.

I will then attempt to refute some of the major objections generally raised re- garding confl ict prevention in general and early warning systems in particular, using them as fi ndings of diffi culties that need to be resolved. Finally, taking into account the needs identifi ed earlier, using the experience gained from several early warning systems such as those already existing in Germany, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, 5 I will deal with the various stages which, in our view, should be priorities in the development of an op- erational and effective early warning sys- tem should a country such as France wish to equip itself with such a system. The prevention process: several actors, various operations I will give a brief outline here of the con- text of which the early warning system forms a part, namely the prevention process as a whole, in the case of a confl ict, highlighting the main actor types and the operations im- plemented. As we will see later, prevention and thus the warning system may also cover other subject matter, such as instability. At the centre of the process, therefore, is the situation to be prevented: the confl ict. This is depicted on an arc, showing escalation towards a confl ict as a succession of continu- ous and contiguous stages.

Various actions and actors are involved in these various stages of confl ict. During non-violent stages, and this is a relatively new development, development actors are of fundamental importance. They carry out long-term action through development and cooperation aid programmes which, at the very least, attempt to have no detrimental or accelerating effect on the possibilities of confl ict. This is the approach known as \u2018do no harm\u2019. During these stages, diplomatic and military personnel generally focus on their traditional roles, although they may also be involved in cooperation programmes. In ad- dition, their function, in relation to stages of confl ict, tends to be connected with observa- tion, collecting information and analysis. As tensions increase, usually in stage 3, actions known as \u2018preventative diplomacy\u2019 begin. These cover a whole range of nego- tiations with the aim of resolving disputes, preventing the outbreak of war or reaching a peace agreement once war has broken out. Until recently, preventative diplomacy was the main means for preventing confl icts.

Questions about early warning systems: identifying constraints and diffi culties When speaking about early warning sys- tems, several points of opposition, resistance and doubts/questions of three types arise. 11 It is vital to respond to these criticisms, not only to convince those who voice them who, very often, will, to a greater or lesser ex- tent, have to take part in the early warning system, but also because the obstacles men- tioned often have a solid basis in fact and must therefore be overcome to ensure that forecasting can work properly. The fi rst type of perceptual constraint is not limited, in fact, to early warning systems but questions the justifi cation for prevention itself; the second poses questions regarding the validity, usefulness, and signifi cance of an early warning system for crises and con- fl icts; the third, fi nally, has to do with the prevent, manage or resolve the confl ict or reconstruct peace is managed through information structured in a relevant man- ner, so as to enable an understanding of the situation. Since the action must be prepared, planned, and implemented, the information must be supplied as a fore- cast, as early as possible. These forecasting procedures, jointly known as \u2018early warn- ing systems\u2019, therefore aim to identify as early as possible a risk or a situation that we desire to prevent, so that the necessary prevention means may be implemented. The specifi c act of giving a warning on the risks or situations identifi ed \u2014 in other words the alert \u2014 is only one step in this process. Originally, \u2018classical\u2019 early warning sys- tems tended to start at stage 3, in an at- tempt to forecast stages 4 and 5. With the international community\u2019s growing interest in preventing confl icts in the long term, this perspective has become inadequate. Early warning systems must now also make it possible to forecast stages 1 and 2. Early warning systems must be opera- tional not only during stages of escalation but also during stages of stabilisation, when part in these actions, but they also incorpo- rate, and increasingly so, a civil component. Their aim is to keep in check and monitor the escalation or de-escalation of tension. 7 Once a peace agreement has been signed, the de-escalation or stabilisation stages commence. All actors participate in these stages and the actions are multi-dimen- sional. These operations are known as \u2018peacebuilding\u2019. The actors involved are both states and international governmental organisations (IGOs) or non-governmental organisations (NGOs). With regard to crises, the latter now have an established role, although on some occasions this is controversial for some types of action 8 and may therefore need to be reconsidered. In addition, the interna- tional community\u2019s efforts to take action on the funding sources of the various par- ties involved in a war, such as in the case of confl ict diamonds, suggest that private actors as well as commercial and industrial companies also have a role to play in terms of prevention. 9 The relationship between the confl ict on the ground and the actors wishing to 7 Emma Stewart, \u201cConfl ict Prevention: Consensus or Confusion?\u201d, Peace, Confl ict and Development , No 3, Dept of Peace Studies, University of Bradford, 06/2003, <www.peacestudiesjournal.org.uk/>. 8 B.

        "[ 369 ] try in crisis, which might be of interest for the various stakeholders. For example, there are the diffi culties in the peacebuilding op- erations such as those currently taking place in Afghanistan. With regard to the politi- cal dimension, the \u2018country risk\u2019 approach is therefore inadequate. Some companies, such as the Eurasia group, have positioned themselves on the specifi c market of political risk forecasting. Thus, together with Deut- sche Bank, Eurasia has created the DESIX index of political stability. 15 However, the aim of this approach, namely to evaluate the \u2018impact of politics on the markets\u2019, is again different from that of an early warn- ing system. 16 Taking into account the disparity in aims and thus in results of these different fore- casting tools ought to enable us, in an en- riching and constructive manner, to seek the complementary aspects of these methods, including crisis early warning systems, with a view to optimising their usefulness. Is an early warning system useful? With regard to the very relevance of a forecasting system, critics point fi rstly to the intuition of practitioners and special- ists from the countries and regions under analysis, who need no additional tool to know exactly what is happening in their Is an early warning system and a refl ection on its signifi cance necessary? Country risk analysis and the early warning system The existence of \u2018country risk\u2019 analytical tools already in place may possibly con- stitute an obstacle to the introduction of a specifi c early warning system. The aim of the \u2018country risk\u2019 practice is to analyse the economic and fi nancial risks faced by a country and thus potential investors, wheth- er public or private. Examples of this type of measure are the Coface system or those of the US company World Markets Research Center (WMRC) or the British company The Economist Intelligence Unit . 14 Although they do not aim to forecast in- stability or confl icts, these methods none- theless incorporate a certain measure of po- litical risk, but this is given less weight, in terms of the calculations, than economic and fi nancial risk. Nevertheless, politics is a crucial factor here since, in general, any situation of war or major political instability gives rise to a classifi cation in a very high- risk category, linked in particular to default on payments. With such a classifi cation, which is rela- tively broad, it is not possible to distinguish developments in the situation within a coun- posited impossibility of translating the warn- ing into a response. Does the need for certain crises invalidate prevention? The argument whereby a confl ict may be positive poses the tricky question of the validity of preventative action. The need for these crises is, in fact, widely acknowledged. 12 With regard to prevention, however, it is not precisely a question of preventing any crisis or confl ict from occurring but, on the contrary, of attempting to mitigate its most negative and destructive effects that are destabilising for the region and possible for the world. The issue is therefore not making a choice between saving lives, which would be put at risk during a violent confl ict, while allowing an unsuccessful system to survive, or allowing human beings to die, which is in fact in breach of the current emphasis placed on human rights, on the grounds that once the crisis has been resolved the survivors would benefi t from a better system. Instead, it is a question of having a good understand- ing of the dynamics underlying the crisis that is underway or about to take place to allow the advent of a better situation with as lit- tle violence and national and international disturbance as possible 13 . 12 For example, Michi Ebata, From the discourse to the ground: UNDP activities in confl ict prevention , New York: UNDP Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, May 2003; Barrington Moore, Injustice: Social bases of Obedience and Revolt , London: Macmillan, 1978. 13 It should be noted here that some commentators, such as Edward Luttwak, emphasise that only a full victory can resolve a crisis, \u201cGive War a Chance\u201d, Foreign Affairs, July-August 1999. 14 For Coface, see <www.trading-safely.com/sitecwp/cefr.nsf>; WRMC is part of the Global Insight Inc. group <www.wm rc.com/>; for The Economic Intelligence Unit, see <www.eiu.com/>. 15 www.eurasiagroup.net/si/ 16 Ian Bremmer, \u201cManaging Risk in an Unstable World\u201d HBR Spotlight, Harvard Business Review, Onpoint article product 1126, 2005.

        "[ 370 ] to enable it to be applied in varying times and cultural and geographic spaces. For example, we know that a change of regime is a source of instability for a country and that such a period is therefore fragile. 19 If we remained at a lower level of abstraction we would only identify a series of changes, from democracy to more autocratic systems or vice versa, and would see an increase in the probability of confl icts, but we would be unable to draw any conclusion other than one based on the specifi city of the crises. The examples quoted above also cast doubt upon the argument that it is easy to forecast confl icts and that early warn- ing systems already exist. As for the fi rst point, a survey of the research carried out on confl icts and their dynamics reveals how complex the subject is, and that it is not at all obvious, 20 how knowledge can be \u2018forgotten\u2019 and how some results can be counter-intuitive. With regard to the loss of knowledge, it is worth asking how it was possible for the importance of the proper operation of the State, with its monopoly on legitimate means of violence, the the- ory of which was set out by writers such as Hobbes in the 17 th century and Weber in the early 20 th century 21 and which has been long practised, to be forgotten to such at fi rst denies that a confl ict is imminent, and then, having re-examined the various indicators, ends up recognising their rel- evance, shortly before the outbreak of the confl ict. 17 In this sense, intuition, knowledge of a country and experience are necessary but insuffi cient to enable the symptoms of escalation to be identifi ed precisely enough to ensure that forecasting and warning oc- cur in good time. It is, in fact, also necessary to know the mechanisms governing the outbreak of confl icts and crises or instability. Some may argue that each confl ict or crisis is specifi c and unique, which is a view emphasised by institutions such as the UNDP or the Department for International Development (DFID) which, as a result, are abandoning warning systems and prioritising analyti- cal methods. 18 It should, fi rstly, be noted that the use of a single analytical method actually stresses the similarities between confl icts. Secondly, while the manifesta- tions of crises and confl icts do in fact dif- fer, this does not negate either the existence of similar dynamics underlying confl icts or the identifi cation of causes that may give rise to the same effects everywhere, even though they have different outward appear- ances. Therefore, a scientifi c approach is needed, which must be suffi ciently abstract fi eld of expertise. While not wishing to cast doubt upon the value of this knowledge, the representatives of some institutions with an operational early warning system stress, in response, that on occasion it can be seen that even the best specialists or practition- ers, precisely because they are used to the country on which they are working, and in which they live, are sometimes incapa- ble of perceiving an escalation towards a confl ict suffi ciently early. Being able to put events and changes in them into perspective and summarising them in order to compare them to other situations is often vital for forecasting work, but it is not always easy or possible when one is immersed in the day-to-day life of a country. Very often, escalation towards confl ict and its varying causes are only clear once the confl ict has broken out. A famous ex- ample, although it has to do with response, is the appeasement policy adopted by Chamberlain and Daladier towards Hitler, which demonstrates how far the situation was misjudged at the time. More recently, it is useful to consider the crisis in the Ivory Coast and to enquire who forecast it and when. According to the testimony of an ex- pert in early warning systems, it does hap- pen that a country expert, confronted with an alert produced by an operational system, 17 Interview conducted by the author, spring 2006. 18 H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lavoix, Indicateurs et m\u00e9thodologies de pr\u00e9vision des crises et confl its: Evaluation , Paris, AFD, 2005b, <www.cedoc.defense.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=790> 19 E Mansfi eld & J.

It is vital, in fact, that the data available is verifi ed, classi- fi ed, identifi ed and organised so that it can lead to an understanding. This approach, once again, is that proposed by science and therefore needs to be based on a system which makes it possible to select relevant information, so that through analysis and incorporation into the warning system it is possible for the best forecast to be made, which may possibly lead to additional data being sought out, if it is not available in the current large mass of data. Do response diffi culties invalidate early warning systems? With regard to an inability to translate a warning into a response, 25 there are three arguments put forward. 1. The warning would not make it possible to defi ne a programme for action. 2. When the warning is submitted to politi- cians, it only receives, at best, a limited attention if not ignored. The lack of inter- est by politicians is said to be due, on the one hand, to the mismatch in time frames between election dates and preventative is certain that such early warning systems ought already to exist and to form an in- tegral part of the various institutions of the State focusing on foreign or domestic affairs since one of the State\u2019s duties is to ensure external security and domestic peace, 24 the fi rst task will be to verify the effectiveness and relevance of these systems, the extent to which they are geared to the modern world, and how far new knowledge acquired through research and experience has been incorpo- rated. The second task will be to produce an amalgamation of the warnings produced in this way, especially if they come from dif- ferent departments, agencies or ministries, in order to make them consistent with each other. This confi rms the importance of an actively managed early warning system and once again suggests that a federating struc- ture is needed. This need to bring together and compare existing different warning systems, in or- der to synthesise their results, emphasises a diffi culty which confronts those interested in forecasting, namely the over-abundance of information and reports usually emanat- ing from the experts and practitioners men- tioned above, and information, in the form of open or secret sources. This over-abun- dance of information can overload the in- an extent, whether we think of the cur- rent situation in Iraq, the negative political consequences of the macro-economic re- forms of the 1980s or, again, the current emphasis placed on fragile states, all of which is evidence of the rediscovery of the importance of the state. 22 With regard to the danger of false intuition, we might remember, for example, that pov- erty, usually measured in GDP per capita, is often considered to be a condition that makes confl icts more likely. Now, theoretical work as well as empirical data, such as the case of the former Yugoslavia as compared with many much poorer countries where war has not broken out, show that this supposition is false, and that it is in fact feelings of injus- tice and relative deprivation which increase the likelihood of confl ict. 23 This last example emphasises, additionally, the importance of early warning systems for crises and confl icts that can be applied universally, including to wealthy countries, because it is no longer elsewhere that crises can break out, affect- ing them in a knock-on manner, but they can also break out directly in wealthy coun- tries, since \u2018development\u2019 and \u2018wealth\u2019 are no longer guarantees of peace. With regard to the second point, while it 22 See the joint work to be published on this subject by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Development Agency. 23 Nicholas Sambanis, \u201cUsing Case Studies to Expand the Theory of Civil War\u201d CPR Working Papers , World Bank, Social Development Department Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network, Paper No 5, May 2003; Moore, op. cit. 24 Moore, op. cit. 25 Cf.

        "[ 372 ] attempt to improve even a very small part of a system contributes to the collective efforts required to improve the whole. Finally, with regard to the lack of response despite a well-known diagnosis, as in the case of Darfur, such a verdict would fi rstly require a detailed analysis including know- ing when the exact situation became known \u2014 in other words, at what stage in the confl ict was a warning given? In addition, develop- ing an early warning system does not imply intervention in all situations. It is a question of obtaining an as clear a picture as possi- ble of possible developments in the current situation, so that informed choices can be made based on the objectives and available resources. Thus, in view of the specifi c goals of an actor and its resources, or those of the international community, if the warning is given at too late a stage in escalation, it may become impossible to provide an appropri- ate response. So, having examined several major objec- tions to prevention in general, and to early warning systems in particular, we have seen that they may be dealt with if the diffi culties that they emphasise are taken into account. An early warning system must thus make it possible to select and organise a large variety of information derived from various sources, while being based on an understanding of instability or the dynamics of confl icts and crises, and of a scientifi c nature and regularly verifi ed and updated. It may use the results of other warning or risk analysis systems as increasing the likelihood of confl ict or in- stability. It follows that the \u2018crisis-generating\u2019 areas are known. Although, as a precautionary measure, practitioners of early warning emphasize the fact that they can only reveal problems and not propose solutions, it seems that we ac- tually have here, at the least, a preliminary identifi cation of factors in crises. If an ad- ditional more detailed diagnostic stage, pos- sibly having recourse to country experts, is incorporated as a fi nal stage in the warning system, then the broad outlines of action pro- grammes can be presented to the politicians or to those taking decisions when the warn- ing is made public. Thus, two of the objec- tions raised above have been dealt with. The second criticism is more serious and more diffi cult. It stresses the diffi culties en- countered by contemporary democracies, which are often prisoner to the media, and by complex machinery of State, in adapt- ing to the modern world. In the long term, it seems unlikely that political systems will be able to last if they cannot take decisions and act on the basis of political-historical time, which is a long period. We are therefore faced with an obstacle that goes beyond the subject of early warning and is an integral part of a major challenge confronting many countries. Overcoming it will probably require numer- ous adjustments and some time. However, the fact that we need to resolve this problem, which is broader than the one concerning us here, is no reason to do nothing, since any actions and, on the other hand, to the ab- sence of a suggestion for action accompa- nying the warning. These two fi rst criti- cisms are therefore partially connected. 3. In some cases, the diffi cult situation is said to be well known, and forecast for a long time, but no response is really given. At each stage in prevention, namely: 1. Forecasting; 2. Warning and dissemination of the warning; 3. Diagnosis; 4. Planning of the response, and fi nally 5. Response implementation. Decisions will be necessary and will, on each occasion, give rise to specifi c diffi culties. The fact that a stage, whatever it may be, may present an obstacle does not mean that the whole process should be abandoned. On the contrary, efforts need to be made to re- solve each problem. The fi rst stumbling block, which is the need to defi ne a programme for action, may only be a stumbling block at fi rst view. We have seen that the early warning system should be based on an understanding of the instability or confl icts and their dynamics, of a scientifi c nature. Thus, if such a system makes it pos- sible to forecast a situation and to set off a warning, it can only do so because the meas- ures arising from some of the indicators or mechanisms that form it have been identifi ed ",
        "[ 373 ] tion, and thus that its authority would be di- luted and its effectiveness diminished. Thus, the positioning of this body in the general establishment plan of the state concerned will be a crucial decision, as will the readiness to cooperate of the participating ministries or agencies and the investment and motivation of the staff leading it. Objectives and priorities The aim of an early warning system, as de- fi ned by a high-ranking offi cial in charge of such a system, is to obtain suffi cient details on the world situation suffi ciently early to enable the authority in place to establish a policy, whether this is in terms of total pre- vention or mitigation of potential adverse consequences, and this is to be achieved in line with overall political objectives. The smooth operation of an early warning system thus requires some effort with regard to the defi nition of the general objectives of the actor involved. For example, the main security objective could be to protect a coun- try from terrorist threats or from any kind of threat. This may be combined with an energy supply objective, with purely geopolitical considerations, with a wish to increase po- litical infl uence or strengthen historical links, a wish to protect its nationals, etc. Since it will lead to the defi nition of priorities, this prior highlighting exercise will also be cru- cial once the stage of planning a response is reached. 26 tion by other actors, depending on circum- stances, such as justice, commerce, customs, etc. As forcefully confi rmed by an offi cial with experience in early warning systems and forecasting systems within state institu- tions, it is therefore vital for the body to be given suffi cient authority, within the frame- work of its duties, and the requisite staff and resources. It is not a case of depriving traditional bod- ies of their various early warning capacities, nor of interfering with their tasks, but, on the contrary, of structuring in the best way pos- sible these different areas of expertise within a coherent whole. In cases linked to an emergency, in particu- lar, and thus to traditional type early warning systems, an overarching structure could also promote inter-ministry or inter-institutional dialogue, to discuss the results of the warn- ing and the diagnoses and to contribute to the planning of a coordinated response. Al- though having benefi ts in terms of cost, the most fl exible solution, consisting solely of inter-ministry or interdepartmental meetings, even if these are regular, seems in fact un- able to function, precisely because of the lack of an authority responsible for synthesising and acting as a referee, as well as monitor- ing and forecasting system management is- sues, in the event of a change in personnel. However, there is a risk that the federating structure could turn into an \u2018extra\u2019 institu- and present, as a minimum, outlines for ac- tion proposals when communicated to poli- ticians. These fi rst results must be included in the introduction of an early warning sys- tem for which we are now going to see in more detail how and in what stages it may be developed. Implementing an early warning system The structure responsible for the warning We saw in the introduction that by posi- tioning them at state level, for early warn- ing systems and for prevention more gener- ally, three main areas of intervention were involved: development and cooperation aid \u2014 the actors being, in addition, involved ear- lier and for longer in the prevention of the crisis \u2014 foreign affairs and defence. An early warning system should be able to meet the expectations of the three actors involved and facilitate joint action by them. In view of these imperatives and those concerned with coordination, joint work is required. Besides, in view of the diverse interests, ac- tions and perceptions of the various actors, the experience of some offi cials in charge of early warning systems appears to indicate that it is necessary to make use of a federat- ing body, or even to create one.

However, the qualitative method may be systematised by the use of indicators of the \u2018key ques- tions\u2019 type, measured in a binary or logical manner (yes/no). 32 Similarly, the automatic approach of the quantitative method can incorporate measures of qualitative analy- sis and consideration of causation chains (if these have previously been identifi ed), for example through event data analysis. 33 Briefl y, by coding each element of a phrase (who, what, to whom, where, when), this method makes it possible to calculate state bodies have done when they decided to equip themselves with an early warning system, to understand the mechanisms and dynamics underlying the problem in ques- tion. A synthesis of the various theoretical approaches will be required, together with transformation of social science research that is not always designed to be applied. The main types of method used for fore- casting can be placed along an axis ranging from purely qualitative, where there is a de- tailed analysis by one or more experts, in- cluding a varying number of cases, to quanti- tative, usually based on a statistical approach seeking to correlate various variables and the result sought, such as the ACTOR sys- tem of the US Center for Army Analysis, or some work done by the University of Mary- land. 27 The quantitative perspective also in- cludes the collection of varying sizes of in- dicators, measurable and measured, such as those of the Country Indicators for Foreign Policy (CIFP) in Canada, which offer its us- ers an exceptional database. 28 However, if no link between these indicators is provid- ed, it is then imperative that the whole be What phenomenon should the warning relate to? Depending on the objectives defi ned, the early warning system will attempt to iden- tify the main elements and dynamics leading to the risk or situation to be prevented. Thus, the warning may relate to insta- bility, if it has been judged to be the main cause of the threats that need to be forecast. It may also relate to confl icts, if identifying and preventing them makes it possible to achieve the objectives already defi ned. Creating the warning system Understanding, consistency and modelling Once the objectives and the object of the warning have been defi ned, as the experi- ence of those in charge of operational early warning systems teaches us, we need to cre- ate a system that can successfully identify and forecast the phenomenon to which the warning relates. This, as we have seen, re- quires a scientifi c approach. It will there- fore be necessary to attempt, initially us- ing the results of existing research, as some 27 The data on ACTOR, FORECITE and FOREWARN come from MORS Workshop: \u201cThe Global War on Terrorism: Analytic Support, Tools and Metrics of Assessment\u201d 30 November-2 December 2004, Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, Phalanx online The Bulletin of Military Operations Research \u2014 Vol. 38 No 1 2005, and from Chris Yiu and Nick Mabey, \u201cCountries at Risk of Instability: Practical Risk Assessment, Early Warning and Knowledge Management\u201d Risk Assessment; PMSU Background Paper, February 2005, p. 40 & 43, quoted in Lavoix, Op.

        "[ 375 ] The approach chosen may consist of a narrower and more specifi c defi nition of risks, which therefore attempts to create as many early warning systems as there are risks. At this stage in creating the system, it may turn out that these risks are all gen- erated by the same types of cause or are governed by the same dynamics, such as instability or civil wars, and therefore that an early warning system that takes a broader approach to the principal cause may be more successful and less onerous. It will then be necessary to carry out the process again for the new subject of the warning. Once these theoretical foundations have been defi ned, a synthesis or selection of the methods that seem to be the most successful with regard to the object must be carried out. Next, the task will be to translate these the- ories into an operational system that make forecasting and warning possible. With regard to confl icts, specifi c \u2018indi- cators/questions\u2019 can be created, based on the precise assumptions connected with the understanding that has been developed, making it possible to take into account the history and values of the countries in- volved with the aim of collecting and or- dering information. 37 The questions may be grouped by subject, with each category be- ing then given a different weight for fi nal of confl ict, as has seemed to be the case since early 2005. 35 If the objective is to prevent instability, then after having defi ned the concept, efforts will be made to fi nd the processes that under- lie instability. One could, for instance, use the following as analytical categories connected to instability: the collapse of states, humani- tarian emergencies, large-scale confl icts, vio- lent regime changes, or the existence of areas outside the law within the country. It will then be possible to make use of statistical quantitative methods. However, with these tools it is not possible to take processes into account. It would thus be necessary, for each of these categories, to understand their dy- namics, as well as the interactions between various categories that may increase the risks. For example, a humanitarian emergency is not destabilising in itself, but needs to be understood within its context and develop- ment. The famine linked to the desertifi cation of the Sahel or the tragic living conditions in certain parts of Bangladesh during the fl oods are humanitarian emergencies. However, the consequences in terms of instability may be neither direct nor immediate. It would prob- ably be necessary to introduce a special ap- proach for these kinds of risk which, along the lines of early warning systems linked to natural risks, might be categorised as \u2018slow and erosive\u2019. 36 the occurrence of events such as those spe- cifi cally defi ned by the user. In the sphere of prevention of an ethnic war, for example, one could thus know how many times, in a country X, a group of actors (to be de- fi ned) has threatened another group (also to be defi ned). A marked increase in such an indicator could suggest that the transi- tion towards violence is underway. This method is used by the Virtual Research As- sociate company (VRA) created by Harvard researchers; by SwissPeace Foundation\u2019s early warning system, FAST, in combina- tion with pure qualitative analysis focused on networks of actors; and by the FORECITE (using open sources) and FOREWARN (using restricted sources) systems of the US Center for Army Analysis. 34 Before adopting any method and being able to assess its relevance, it therefore seems necessary to understand the object of the warning as well as possible. If the warning relates to confl icts, then fi rst of all we must defi ne what a confl ict is. An effort will be made to understand its dynamics by including, for example, the Kosimo stages of escalation, as shown in Table 1 above. In view of developments in the understand- ing of the object of the warning, secondary objectives may also be added, seeking, for instance, to identify increasing fragility of states, this being considered to be a cause 34 Ibid .

        "[ 376 ] countries that fall within a traditional area of infl uence. It will be necessary, however, to check that such an a priori selection is consistent with the original objectives pre- viously defi ned. It might also be imagined that, for various reasons connected with the subject of the warning, a classifi cation using member states is not the most relevant. Thus, geographical regions that combine several states might in some cases be chosen, such as the Great Lakes region in Africa, or parts of states, as in the CEWARN early warning system of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), 38 provided that they are then subdi- vided into states again, these being the main actors on the international stage. Similarly, a warning system that seeks to forecast specifi c threats from non-state ac- tors defi ned in terms of their ideological af- fi liations, for instance, could validly choose these groups of actors as its population. They might later be combined with other criteria with a view to monitoring the emergence of new groups. For this forecasting method, it might then be useful to include analysis of networks of actors. 39 The states could com- bine such a system with a more traditional approach, and a synthesis would then again be required to obtain a coherent whole. sis to the statistical quantitative approaches and event data analysis based on an iden- tifi cation of the dynamics of confl icts or instability. More than just an early warn- ing system, such as system then becomes a process. The time period under consideration for forecasting and warning may range from six months to fi ve years, as we will see in the section dealing with results. It is vital for this to be linked in a consistent way with the system developed. What entities will the warning deal with? When the system is being created, and as a logical connection to the model developed, the \u2018population\u2019 which will be the subject of a potential warning must be defi ned. In view of the objectives of the warning, this population is usually made up of the mem- ber states of the international community. The basis may thus be the 192 member states of the United Nations, an approach chosen by some States. However, as confi rmed by some creators of early warning systems, depending on the original objectives of the actor implementing the warning system, this may be reduced, for instance, by only taking into account certain aggregation, in line with its signifi cance with regard to the outbreak of a confl ict. For instance, structural factors may be assessed as having less weight than those measuring escalation towards violence. This method can be described as belonging to the sys- tematic qualitative type. Faced with a great diversity of explana- tions and tools and attempting to retain the best of them, a synthesis appears impossi- ble and the choice may be to select some quantitative methods, and then to try to identify the countries with the same \u2018pro- fi les\u2019. These countries will then be grouped according to their similarities. The fi rst dis- advantage of this method is that it is not based on an understanding of the dynamics and therefore it seems that it will not al- low a warning focusing on a small period of time, whereas this is one of its main ob- jectives. In addition, it would tend to ag- gregate variables without seeking the links between them. The risk is therefore that of being left with an inoperative warning sys- tem or of generating unjustifi ed warnings as far as it mixes issues together without placing them in order. Another way of tackling the diversity of methods, and this choice has been made by some of institutions, is to add expert analy- 38 The member states of IGAD are: the Republic of Djibouti, \u00c9ritrea, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Republic of Kenya, the Republic of Somalia, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of Uganda.

",
        "[ 377 ] After this fi rst classifi cation, which is par- ticularly useful in removing from the \u2018popu- lation\u2019 to be analysed those countries with only a very slight degree of risk, those re- maining on the list may be grouped by geo- graphical regions. A second stage of classi- fi cation may then begin, using, for instance, detailed interviews with specialists, as well as a specifi c questionnaire connected with the subject of the warning. A particular con- cern at this stage will be to emphasise the dynamics of confl ict or instability that exist for each of the countries examined. This di- agnosis will then make it possible to prepare possible response options. Then, analysts from the early warning unit may meet and examine, one by one, the re- sults obtained for each country. They will thus locate each country within its category, either on the curve of confl icts or in relation to the risks of instability. Whatever form of organisation is cho- sen, it is important to combine two ingredi- ents: the use of human analysis and one or more of the most systematic, comparative, and objective methods that exist. As well as meeting the criteria seen above, a quantita- tive approach makes it possible to correct or minimise any bias linked to human per- ception or, in the case of meetings, to group dynamics; a qualitative approach adds back in, within a designed framework, intuition, analytical and synthetic capacities, emotion- al elements and complexity of thought. One person or a team, working coopera- tively and in such a way that the members can compare the results obtained, will then be responsible for collecting the information, analysing the responses and carrying out the calculation. If the results are very different from those obtained previously, the analyst must verify with the person who fi lled in the form the reasons for this change in or- der to reduce the likelihood of disparities that might be the result of bias in perception. For each country, the initial questionnaire may be summarised in one or two pages, stressing developments as compared with the previous analysis and giving a graphic depiction of the curves for the various indicators. When the warning system is made up of a mixture of various tools, the fi rst stage will be to obtain the results derived from the different methods. With regard to the use of analysts at the beginning of the process, it seems sensible to make use of as broad a range of experts as possible, combining knowledge that is external and internal to the actor for whom the warning is being carried out. The results will then be compared. Where they converge, the countries involved will be placed in the corresponding category. Where they diverge, the structure with responsibility for the early warning will contact the various experts involved and try to analyse the rea- sons for this divergence. A decision to place a country in a particular warning category will, in the end, be the responsibility of the structure in charge of the warning system. At all levels of designing the system, it is therefore crucial to develop a dynamic understanding of the subject and to abide by the logical links between the various stages, which will ensure that the system created actually does direct the forecasting and the warning towards the situation to be prevented. Using the early warning system: organisation, information and results Once the modelling of the warning system has been developed, it needs to be activated and managed, which requires an organisa- tion and an input of data, in order to obtain the results to which the warning will, in the end, relate. Organisation The experience of users of early warning systems shows that the whole warning proc- ess is conducted in general about once or twice a year. At the same time, units that are the subject of an extremely urgent warning may be monitored regularly. When the warning system is made up of a single mode, composed for instance of key questions, use can be made of an external centre of experts, or personnel working on the ground may be asked, after receiving brief training, if necessary, to complete the questionnaire. It is vital that the question- naire be made up of simple questions and that it can be completed in one or two hours per country. ",
        "[ 378 ] The results The fi nal result will display a distribution of the units covered by the warning system, which are usually countries, classifi ed with regard to the subject of the warning. As existing early warning systems show, if the subject is confl ict, then the countries may be classifi ed depending on their position on the curve of stages of confl ict. If the subject is instability, then the countries may be grouped in line with various time horizons of instabil- ity, such as six months, two years, and fi ve years. This second form of classifi cation, al- though more traditional and easier to manage in terms of planning a response, is also less certain. In fact, it imposes a measuring scale, namely time, as an extrinsic absolute, whereas historical time is really variable in terms of the actors\u2019 interactions. 42 To overcome this dif- fi culty, it would be necessary to explain the mechanisms and dynamics connected with instability, as has been done for confl icts. On the other hand, the locating of a re- sult on the curve of confl icts, which is more faithful to reality and therefore gives more reliable results, will possibly be diffi cult to translate into a response, especially due to the habitual practices of planning. Addition- al \u2018translation\u2019 work will therefore need to be carried out to convert from time measured in possible to combat involuntary cognitive closures (obedience to methods, unconscious choices, selective screening caused by emo- tion, prejudice, etc.). 40 It must also ensure that information from sub-national sourc- es, depending on the circumstances, can be passed on. Whatever the warning system, the main concern when it is being used will be to assess the validity of the raw informa- tion, then to restrict any bias linked to the perceptions of the analyst. With regard to raw information, the dou- ble assessment system using the source, on the one hand, and vectored information, on the other hand, has proven itself in particu- lar within the information services or more recently in the system introduced by FAST. It should, however, be noted that rumours, partially true news and narration may be useful, in that they reveal the beliefs and aims, concerns and anxieties of the actors under consideration. 41 In addition to reducing them through the use of a systematic model, the perceptual bias of the analyst will be easier to correct by comparing analyses over time and with other countries, as well as through a check on the internal consistency and logic of the argument set out. Finally, the organisation must include knowledge management and self-assess- ment, which will enable it to include the re- sults of new research and also to learn from any errors that may be made. Each error detected must be the subject of a diagnosis to identify its origin and correct the system appropriately. This process must be planned over the long term so that very remote warn- ings can be taken into account. Information Information may come from open or re- stricted access sources. As we saw previ- ously, it is not so much the availability of information as its relevance that poses a problem. With regard to a state, in fact, a lot of data is put forward, without reference to any particular situation, because of the existence of information services and net- works of diplomatic bodies and other agen- cies covering the various political, military, economic, and social milieus. Comprehen- sive access to the media and the use of net- works of external experts may be added to this arrangement. The problem of selecting relevant infor- mation is directly related to the design of the warning system and should therefore be resolved during the design process. In particular, the model created must make it 40 For an example of closure and opening of cognitive fi lters in crisis situations, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lavoix, \u2018 Nationalism\u2019 and \u2018Genocide\u2019: the construction of nation-ness, authority and opposition \u2014 The case of Cambodia (1861-1979) , PhD Thesis, SOAS \u2014 University of London, 2005a. 41 See, for example, the work of the philosophers Wittgenstein and Quine or the neurobiologists Maturana and Varela.

        "[ 379 ] Next, with the involvement of the various relevant ministries, departments or agen- cies, these scenarios would be transformed into potential short intervention programmes or response planning, setting out the broad strategic approach for an action that would be as effective as possible, and then all the responses would be reviewed and assessed in terms of the objectives and available re- sources, thus defi ning some priorities. 43 This process would make it possible not only to examine the multi-dimensional ef- fects of an action, but also to select the best time to act. Only a correlation of the po- tential actions and the dynamic dimension of the processes to which the warning re- lates can produce such a picture in the long term. It is this list of countries, categorised and accompanied by possible responses, which can fi nally be used to launch the warning, and thus be submitted to the fi nal deci- sion-makers. At the same time, a decision may be taken to systematically monitor the countries with the highest level of risk, as is currently the case, so that developments in the situation can be monitored continu- ously. An internal warning may also be is- sued within various institutions, including diplomatic bodies, offi ces and agencies on Launching the warning: decision and proposals for action As we saw in the second section, it would seem that a warning in itself is not enough to attract the attention of politicians. They also need solutions to be put forward to them. Therefore, a detailed diagnosis needs to be attached to the warning, with assessments of possible preventative actions and their conse- quences, and fi nally proposals for a response, the latter being put forward together with the result of the warning. Early warning systems thus allow a rela- tively broad fi rst analysis, at the least, of the problems facing the countries being moni- tored. Next, an expert or group of experts should be consulted, for each country, to draw up a precise diagnosis of risk, instabil- ity or confl ict situation for each country. The skills that will be required at this level must include not only knowledge of the country but also an understanding of the dynamics underlying the phenomena that are to be pre- vented. The team in charge of the early warn- ing system must then review these detailed analyses. It might be advisable to employ the scenarios method at this stage. Possibly, fur- ther coordination with the results obtained by the specifi c early warning \u2018sub-systems\u2019 of other institutions may then take place. tension to time measured in the traditional form of months and years. The number of countries, classifi ed by cat- egories and appearing on the fi nal list, will in fact depend on the reality of the situation. It is impossible to set in advance the number of countries that are unstable or at the risk of a confl ict. If we imagine, for example, that a new world war is on the horizon, then a very large number of countries will be in a state of advanced escalation. It would be impossi- ble and even dangerous to arbitrarily decide that only some of these should be marked out as the subject of a warning. The indices that make it possible to detect global danger would not be perceived, and a suitable diag- nosis would not be performed nor would the requisite responses be planned. It is therefore not possible to restrict in advance the fi nal result of the early warning system. Correlating the results from the early warning system with objectives and resources The resulting list of countries, appropri- ately classifi ed, may, or rather must be cor- related with the objectives defi ned initially and the resources available. From this point, a new list of, for instance, between 20 and 60 countries, may be selected for interven- tion or response. 43 For an outline of the importance of priorities, G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bonningues, art. cit.

        "[ 380 ] Conclusion First of all, I defi ned what an early warn- ing system should be, while setting out the overall prevention process of which it forms a part. Next, based on the resistance and oppo- sition generated by the use of early warn- ing systems, I pointed out several diffi cul- ties and constraints that should be taken into account when the procedure is being designed. Lastly, I suggested that a federating struc- ture within a state body would be best able to successfully manage this warning sys- tem, because of the needs for synthesis and management of differing time horizons re- quired. I then analysed seven major stages in the implementation of an early warning system, from the defi nition of the state\u2019s ob- jectives and overall strategies to the system\u2019s design, use and fi nally the diffi culties relat- ing to the need for a coordinated response prepared within the inescapable diversity of the international world. Challenging the inevitability in the pre- ventative approach, that would say that only failure can be detected, early warning sys- tems, by helping to incorporate respons- es into an overall strategy and helping to measure their effects regularly, contribute to creating the confi dence upon which, in the end, the reduction of uncertainty and insecurity is based. world where responses must be coordinated for reasons of effectiveness, cost, and legiti- macy, how is diversity to be managed without it resulting in inaction? A managed diversity may represent one form of response. Within the early warning process, an ad- ditional stage of communication with the other actors in the international community can be inserted. Thus, the results of warning systems, before being correlated with the re- sources and objectives of each state, could be exchanged, according to the wish of the actors. The differences between the results would then be compared, using a techni- cal approach, and without forgetting that the initial objectives of the actors will have governed the creation of the early warning systems. This would require efforts in terms of transparency, but would also make it pos- sible perhaps to improve forecasting tools and to disseminate knowledge, while reduc- ing reasons for a lack of understanding. At this stage, the consequences of too wide a communication of the results of the early warning systems should be taken into account, particularly for the countries or groups affected. These potential effects will have to be assessed and incorporated into the general strategy. Lastly, there will still be negotiations con- nected with the diverging objectives of the international actors, which also guarantee a certain degree of freedom. the ground, so that all the actions taken in respect of these countries are redefi ned and coordinated to take into account the fore- cast situation. The early warning system and the international system: alignment At this stage, relying on its knowledge of the international situation generated by the early warning system and with a clear vi- sion of its objectives and the resources to be implemented to achieve them, the actor will be able to meet other states and multilateral bodies so that a coordinated international response, which is satisfactory to it, can be put in place. As this process lies outside the fi eld of this study, I will restrict myself here to examining the diffi culties and benefi ts that may result from the use of various early warning systems by the various interna- tional actors. This diversity is a result of the anarchic nature of the international system, albeit one governed by rules. In contrast to the case within a country, it is impossible for a single warning system to be selected as the authoritative one. However, as the diversity of warnings may give rise to doubts and prolong the time taken for consideration and decision-making, some may suggest that one country and therefore one warning system be adopted as a reference point. Such an approach would run coun- ter to the principle of the independence and sovereignty of states and might have danger- ous consequences in terms of hegemony. In a ",

        "[ 383 ] Introduction This article will focus on the main fac- tors that contribute to the dangers of vio- lent armed internal confl ict erupting, or re- igniting after a peace has been concluded in an erstwhile confl ict zone. I have argued that for either of the two forces that have been identifi ed in the literature to cause confl ict \u2014 greed or grievance \u2014 to take the form of large-scale violence there must be other factors at work, specifi cally a weak- ening of the \u2018social contract\u2019. 1 Such a viable social contract can be suffi cient to restrain, if not eliminate, opportunistic behaviour such as large-scale theft of resource rents, and the violent expression of grievance. The social contract, therefore, refers to the mechanisms and institutions of peaceful confl ict resolution. What causes these mechanisms underly- ing a social contract to degenerate? I argue that the term \u2018failed state\u2019 is inappropriate, as very few states actually fail totally; there is degeneration rather than the total break- down of the social contract. So what factors lead to the breakdown of the social contract within a nation-state? What circumstances create incentives for groups within societies to choose war rather than resolve disputes peacefully? O N THE INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL CONFLICT Syed Mansoob Murshed of the Institute of Social Studies in the Netherlands is also Professor of International Economics at Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham, UK. He was the fi rst holder of the rotating Prince Claus Chair in Development and Equity in 2003. He was a Research Fellow at UNU/WIDER in Helsinki where he ran projects on \u2018Globalisation and Vulnerable Economies\u2019 and \u2018Why Some Countries Avoid Confl ict, While Others Fail\u2019. He also ran a project on\u2019 The Two Economies of Ireland\u2019, fi nanced by the International Fund for Ireland at the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre (NIERC), Belfast, UK. He is the author of fi ve books and more than 75 book chapters and journal articles. His research interests are in the economics of confl ict, aid conditionality, political economy, macroeconomics and international economics. Redistributive mechanisms Within nation-states, the fi scal system will secure a workable social contract if the allocation of public expenditures and the apportionment of taxes are judged to be fair, or at least not so unfair that some groups judge taking resources by force the better option. There are many examples of confl icts emerging out of fi scal disputes. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for instance, became unstable with the col- lapse of the social contract engineered by the late president Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, in which he allocated public spending across the regions to successfully buy the loyalty of the country\u2019s ethnic groups. Disputes over the apportionment of revenues from natural resources are especially common and, as in Indonesia and Nigeria, these take on ethnic and regional dimensions. Contemporary civil wars are more often related to the breakdown of explicit or im- plicit arrangements to share resources or revenues, rather than the absence of an agreement to share resources or rents. One reason that a contract to share revenues en- counters diffi culties is the imperfect cred- ibility with which the side that controls the \u2018pot\u2019 honours its commitment. Indeed, the presence or discovery of oil or gas may pro- mote secessionist tendencies among groups who do not wish to share it with the rest of the nation. 2 Democratic transitions Political science research points out that the risk of confl ict is lower in both well- established democracies and autocracies. It suggests that confl ict risk is at its highest during transitions to and away from de- mocracy when state capacity is weak, and also in fl edgling and imperfect democracies (anocracies). There is more violent expres- sion of grievances during early democratic phases as the aggrieved feel suddenly em- powered. Most developing countries are im- perfect democracies, or at any early stage of the democratic transition. In the interim between full-blown forms of either autoc- racy or democracy (anocracy) countries may have electoral processes which characterise democracy, co-existing with weak or non- existent separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary in particular. This not only prevents them from function- ing like true democracies, but impairs gov- ernance, especially the rule of law. Another problem is the widespread electoral violence in anocracies. Finally, there is the risk that new democracies can periodically slide back 1 See Syed Mansoob Murshed and Zulfan Tadjoeddin (2007). \u2018Reappraising the Greed and Grievance Explanations for Confl ict\u2019, MICROCON Research Working Paper no 2, see http://www.microconfl ict.eu/ 2 See Michael L.

        "[ 384 ] to autocracy engendering a vicious cycle of democracy to autocracy, back to democracy and so on. Given the imperfect nature of democra- cies and good governance in most devel- oping countries we need to be cognizant of the motivation and incentives of their rulers. With regard to incentives faced by rulers in developing countries, it has to be remembered that until the end of the Cold War most developing countries were ruled by strong men. In other words, they were autocracies. Some promoted development, others did not. Compare Mobutu\u2019s Zaire (1965-97) to Suharto\u2019s Indonesia (1965-98). In Indonesia and Zaire resource fl ows were volatile. In one case the dictator (Suharto) chose diversifi cation and growth-enhancing strategies, as well as policies aimed at equal- isation and poverty reduction to contain political opposition. Development in Indo- nesia was impressive, and may have led, at least partially, to endogenous demands for democracy. In the other case (Zaire, now DRC), Mobutu did not, because he felt that diversifi cation and investment in infrastruc- ture would loosen his grip on power and strengthen political opposition to him based on ethnicity. Zaire, or the DRC, has perhaps the poorest post-1960 growth record on the planet. Perhaps, in East Asia greater fears of communism strengthened benevolence in dictators (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia), whereas in Africa a certain type of factionalism dominated policies and politics, retarding growth enhancing eco- nomic diversifi cation and infrastructural development. The lack of economic progress The most robust indicator that predicts the risk of confl ict is the lack of econom- ic growth and development in low-income countries. In fact, at a higher income people have a lot more to lose from violent means of confl ict resolution. 3 The lack of growth also increases vulnerability to economic shocks. Furthermore, the absence of eco- nomic growth retards institutional develop- ment (democracy and governance), contrib- uting to the risk of armed confl ict. It is no surprise that most rich countries are peaceful democracies. Also, the state\u2019s capacity to ei- ther assuage (through transfers) or suppress (by armed force) malcontents is weaker the poorer the country in question. By the same token, post-confl ict economic recovery must be inclusive and broad-based to prevent a new outbreak of grievances. Synthesis To get an empirical feel for some of these channels, a descriptive look at the data may be in order. Table I 4 gives us 17 countries with the highest confl ict incidence since 1960, along with their average annual long- term growth rates of per-capita income, ac- companied by the typology of the economy and the most frequent regime type. In Ta- ble I , we compare growth rates, the com- bined democracy and autocracy score known as polity, 5 endowment type and confl ict in- tensity or incidence in selected developing countries during the period 1965-2000. The polity score is an imperfect proxy for insti- tutional capacity and governance, but we have good time series data on these. This is coded 1 for autocracies (those with an autocracy score below \u20134), 3 for democra- cies (for democracy scores above 4) and 2 for anocracies that have both democratic and autocratic characteristics (with scores of between \u20134 and 4). The endowment ty- pology is based upon a country\u2019s principal exports, 6 and is subject to change. Note that countries can have more than one year of civil war in any given calendar year if there are several confl icts taking place within the nation simultaneously (e.g. Burma/Myan- mar, India, etc.). 3 Seymour Lipset (1960).

They are also more diver- sifi ed economies, and are able to withstand the commodity price and national income fl uctuations that make growth failure more likely. Growth also needs to be pro-poor, which ultimately means less inequality, so as to minimise the effects of group inequalities and polarisation. Diffuse economies also have confl ict; ex- amples of the high incidence of civil wars occurring in diffuse economies are in South Asia \u2014 the Philippines and Burma/Myanmar \u2014 as well as Mozambique and Zimbabwe in Africa. In total, 8 out of 30 diffuse econo- mies have avoided civil war, a record that is better than for point-sourced and cof- fee/cocoa-based economies. Manufactur- ing exporters are least likely to experience (a) Only fi ve of these high-confl ict in- cidence nations reported in Table 1 have a per-capita income growth rate in excess of 2 per cent per annum in the long-term: Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Colombia and Uganda. Generally speaking, poor growth performers have more confl ict years in Ta- ble 1. Furthermore, only three point-sourced countries and four coffee/cocoa economies did not descend into some form of civil war.

        "[ 386 ] countries are neither stable democracies nor autocracies, lending support to the fi nding that confl ict risk is greatest when regime types are in transition, for example from autocracy to democracy. In summary, problems associated with the democratic transition, the degeneration of redistributive mechanisms and the lack of economic growth contribute to long-term confl ict risk. Their short-term manifesta- tions take the form of the inability to cope with economic shocks (associated with fall- ing export prices or natural calamities), or violent political instability. Either way, there are plenty of indicators of both for observ- ers and policy-makers to see; in many cases they will benefi t from exchanging informa- tion. Decision-makers in developed coun- tries like those in the EU then need to decide when, where and how to intervene \u2014 the extent of their reaction is something that is ultimately related to their own political incentives and imperatives. (b) It is discernable that India, Sri Lanka and Colombia are the stable democracies in the post-1960 era that have had civil wars, including high-intensity confl ict. Many of the transitions in regime type from au- tocracy to anocracy to democracy (during 1960-2000) are described in Murshed (2006) op. cit. Multiple switches in all directions are possible, and not just from autocracy to democracy. Nevertheless, only 5 out of the 17 nations with a high confl ict incidence have ever been democracies with a democ- racy score over 4. Democracy, even stable democracy, does not guarantee the absence of armed confl ict, both of the secessionist and rebel varieties, as the examples of India, Colombia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and others indicate. Autocracies also fall into confl ict; nevertheless, stable autocracies such as China and Singapore have avoided civil war, as did Taiwan and South Korea, which became democracies recently. Despite prominent outliers such as India, Colom- bia and Saudi Arabia, most confl ict prone ",
        "[ 387 ] Introduction Effective early warning and response (EW&R) systems would be able to prevent a great deal of human suffering and far- reaching instability caused by manmade and non-manmade violence and harm. An effective EW&R system can be compared to a relay race. All members of the relay team have to work closely together, well attuned to each other and give their best in reach the goals set at the beginning to the race. If the result was less successful than expected, lessons must be learned to improve chanc- es to perform better during the next race. The EW&R system works in a similar, cycli- cal fashion ( see Figure 1 ). Unfortunately, in EW&R systems individual team members do not know each other well, do not understand each other well and are poorly coordinated in reaching their joint goals. Much can be done to improve this situation. As will be argued in this article, many such EW&R systems understand their goal only poor- ly: threats are pre-defi ned and pre-selected without much relevance to the affected pop- ulations, with early warning systems moni- toring trends leading towards or away from those pre-defi ned threats. For most early warning systems the focus is on the likeli- hood of political, armed violence. In sum- mary, EW&R systems often suffer, among other technical diffi culties, from three main conceptual fl aws: they are focused on the I MPROVING EARLY WARNING AND RESPONSE SYSTEMS : L EARNING FROM HUMAN SECURITY , PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE Albrecht Schnabel: is the director of the research programme on human security (HUSEC) and coordinator of the early warning programme FAST International at swisspeace, the Swiss Peace Foundation in Bern, Switzerland.

In the following text we will look at these challenges by refl ecting on some of swisspeace\u2019s experience and lessons learned in early warning and response activities. A new focus will be suggested: threat analyses should take the place of conventional con- fl ict analyses when devising and running EW&R systems. Together with improvements in more effective joint efforts when mov- ing from the defi nition of threats to their monitoring, analysis, warning, policy infl u- ence and implementation, working on key threats will likely make the greatest contri- bution to assuring peace, security and sta- bility.

By com- bining current early warning information with additional data collection and linking this pooled assessment system with an ef- fi cient mechanism for effective response, GCPM has so far resulted in the creation of an international network of confl ict analy- sis, warning and response mechanisms and institutions, with a pilot project in Guinea- Bissau. Elements of this system are already try desk offi cers in Bern cooperate with the relevant country teams and international experts in writing bi-monthly qualitative re- ports on trends in confl ict and cooperation.

GCPM \u2014 Global Crisis Prevention Mechanism For the past two years swisspeace and the Alliance for Peacebuilding (AfP) have been in future EW&R efforts is not only desirable but crucially important in the face of one of the most important future threats: climate- induced environmental disasters and their multiple, negative consequences. Fine-tuning early warning and response: experience and lessons learned The work of swisspeace on early warning and early response (see www.swisspeace.org) includes both methodological development as well as practical operationalisation of early warning tools as policy and decision- support aids. More specifi cally, this work is based on three activities: an early warning programme (FAST), the development of a global crisis prevention mechanism (GCPM) and a human security-focused analysis and monitoring system (OPHUSEC). FAST \u2014 early analysis of tensions and fact-fi nding The political early warning system \u2014 FAST \u2014 was developed in 1998 to assist develop- ment cooperation agencies in their longer- term work on structural prevention. With the help of country teams in each of the 20 to 25 countries monitored by the system, FAST collects cooperative and confl ictive event data on both national and sub-nation- al levels. The data serves as the foundation for quantitative as well as qualitative event data and trend analyses. FAST\u2019s quantita- tive research team has developed a tool that allows quantitative forecasting of stability and instability trends ( see Figure 2 ).

The aim is to identify key threats in a given context and to develop threat and context specifi c response measures, mechanisms and im- plementation strategies. The project claims that threat analyses are more effective than confl ict analyses in detecting \u2014 and conse- quently managing \u2014 threats that are relevant to specifi c populations in specifi c contexts. The methodology designed for this project has so far been integrated in early warning trainings and briefi ngs for the African Un- ion and several African regional economic communities. Lessons and experiences In the context of these experiences, a number of lessons emerged. These will guide our future activities in operationalis- ing early warning and response mechanisms and may also prove useful for other, similar, activities: (cid:129) fi rst, systematic fact-fi nding and analy- sis are essential requirements for pro- ducing reliable risk analyses. However, this does require a presence in the coun- try or region to be covered. Regardless of the type of information collected (such as event data or statistical information), it needs to be gathered and analysed at least partly from sources accessible only from within the country. Moreover, when collecting information, the focus should not only be on \u2018bad news\u2019; that is, evidence for tensions or otherwise been working on a population- and context- focused threat and response analysis, moni- toring and warning system, entitled \u2018Opera- tionalizing Human Security\u2019, or OPHUSEC ( see Figure 4 ). The focus is currently on pi- lot case studies in Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan and Caracas (the latter as a distinctly urban con- text). Local research teams and multi-stake- holder groups take a human security focus in identifying key threats from a multitude of traditional and non-traditional threats Figure 3: GCPM methodology underway, including an actively engaged provisional governing board, a steering committee for West Africa information, a list of resource organisations in West Africa, the pilot in Guinea-Bissau, and considerable funds committed to this process.

Thus, unless specifi - cally tasked to address a very specifi c threat, early warning systems should not automatically focus on a pre-selected threat (such as armed confl ict or envi- ronmental disasters) without a careful analysis of actual threats, causes and ac- tors. Otherwise responses do not match threats, and resources and opportunities are lost. Additionally, different threat situations and early warning systems re- quire different data and analysis meth- ods. For example, the analysis of event data (or opinion polls or structural data) might work for one threat, but not for others; (cid:129) in this context, and as a fourth point, it proved helpful to take a population- centred human security approach. The advantage is that such an approach takes into account both \u2018traditional\u2019 direct vio- lence and \u2018non-traditional\u2019 structural vi- olence. It therefore helps addressing also those longer-term threats that are key to sustainable peace and security even after international actors have left a confl ict or post-confl ict theatre. Moreover, this approach highlights one important is- sue: if at all possible it is important to mitigate and resolve existing stress fac- tors before and while preventing addi- tional ones. Often doing the fi rst will be a crucial contribution to the latter. How- ever, with limited resources and limited possibilities of being involved in all and ing is not about reading the crystal ball. However, \u2018trends\u2019 of confl ict and co- operation, of instability and stability, can be predicted quite reliably. Based on those trends, scenarios can be developed about what will likely happen if preven- tive measures are taken or not; (cid:129) third, in many situations the focus of early warning neglect the real threats and challenges at stake: information is collected on the likelihood of politi- cal crises while people suffer and die in much greater numbers of many other, deteriorating conditions. \u2018Good news\u2019, such as cooperative trends and general information that points to overall im- provements are necessary in creating re- liable refl ections of the various political, economic or social forces characterising the degree of stability experienced by a particular country; (cid:129) second, early warning efforts often suf- fer from expectations that are too high: very specifi c events such as the out- break of a crisis tend to be reported after the fact, not right before.

In addition, such net- works of excellence should receive sup- port that is solid enough to allow them to refocus their work to joint efforts in meeting some of the key challenges in early warning and response initiatives. The Confl ict Prevention Network, sup- ported by the European Commission, is an example for such an approach. In the following sections we will address one of the key challenges of the coming decades: the negative consequences of cli- mate change. As will be shown, heeding the lessons discussed above will offer opportuni- ties to create workable and effi cient preven- tive and remedial measures to address cli- mate change-induced crises and suffering. Sailing the \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019 1 \u2013 tackling climate change with a human security-based EW&R system Climate change is primarily a result of hu- man activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Rising carbon dioxide levels lead to global warming, which in turn contributes among others to global ice melting, thermal expansion of the oceans and is thus more eagerly awaited and used, and might thus lead to more effective responses. Manageable, feasible, mul- ti-actor responses to the most relevant threats and root causes will add legiti- macy to a politically sensitive process. Reaching the right target audience at the right time, with information that is needed (and desired!) is as important as it is diffi cult to accomplish unless con- tinuous information and feedback loops are in place; (cid:129) as a sixth and fi nal point, it is crucial to assure joint local, national and interna- tional expertise and collaboration from analysis to warning to response. What works best, is a multi-stakeholder ap- proach: only in this way shared owner- ship is supported from the analysis to the response. In an interdependent sys- tem of different actors perform different tasks, but as in a \u2018relay run\u2019, all parts of the team have to work harmoniously together. Only then can the monitoring and analysis of situations lead to their eventual improvement and the preven- tion of crisis escalation. Also needed is less duplication and competition. In- stead there need to be efforts to pool ideas, experiences and resources to gen- erate information and policy advice that is timely, relevant and legitimate. With some persuasion and, not least, with the every potential crisis situation, it is im- portant to pay special attention to fragile populations that do not have the coping capacities to absorb new stress factors. Thus, it will for instance be important to analyse and determine the degree to which different societies will or will not be able to cope with the negative fall-out of climate change, as climate change- induced disasters might, for instance, trigger natural resource confl icts much faster in a fragile society than in a sta- ble society featuring a range of coping capacities. This issue will be discussed in more detail below; (cid:129) a fi fth, but not at all new lesson points, to the often frustrating recognition that much greater emphasis has to be put on assuring effective responses and imple- mentation. As stated previously, an ear- ly warning and response system mirrors a relay, in which objectives will not be met unless all parts work together effi - ciently and effectively. An early warn- ing system without an effective link to the implementation of response meas- ures has little value unless informa- tion is transferred and addressed with some degree of responsibility and con- cern about its utilisation. Here again, context-driven analyses of threats and responses may be able to provide in- formation that is more relevant, that 1 The phrase \u2018perfect storm\u2019 refers to the simultaneous occurrence of events which, taken individually, would be far less powerful than the result of their chance combination. Such occurrences are rare by their very nature, so that even a slight change in any one event contributing to the perfect storm would lessen its overall impact.

Until the latter\u2019s failure to do so will trigger explosions of violence, in- stability and population movements strong enough to pose severe threats to the stability and well-being of the North. Thus, the global community will need to assess realistically the unavoidable threats posed by climate change and explore means and ways to limit its negative impact. Find- ing the right balance between self-preserva- tion and incentives to actively support other nations in their quest to adapt to and avert climate change is a tremendous challenge. change will likely continue largely unham- pered for some time to come. We will have to adapt to new climate patterns and climatic conditions. However, there is wide variation in countries\u2019 ability to cope with and adapt to the negative impact of climate change. Countries with surplus wealth will develop coping mechanisms. Although costly, those measures will move populations away from danger zones, adapt agriculture and industry, and generate other means to minimise the inconveniences caused by climate change to society, economy and the political system. Early preparedness and response will allow those societies to absorb the negative fallout of climate change. Countries that are already affected by mul- tiple-stress factors, including poverty, social and political instability, will be much more susceptible to the negative consequences of climate change for at least two reasons: On the one hand, they possess only lim- ited means to prepare for countering cli- mate change impacts and, on the other hand, they are already suffering from a variety of threats that will only be amplifi ed by the lat- ter. For example, single-crop economies will be more susceptible to rising temperatures, and poverty-stricken populations will have no means of developing coping strategies to deal with changing climate patterns, to rising sea levels, shifting wind patterns and distribution of rainfall, heat waves, drying out of currently fertile regions, melting per- mafrost regions (which will further release CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere) and a large range of resulting environmental dis- asters. According to IPCC fi ndings, global temperatures have been rising by 0.74\u02daC over the past 100 years, with an expected further increase of 1.1\u02daC to 6.4\u02daC by the end of the 21 st century. This could cause a rise in sea levels by 18 to 59 cm, and much higher lev- els if the Greenland ice sheet or Antarctica continues to melt. 2 Climate change-induced environmental disasters will likely cause great human suf- fering and pose great risks to economic de- velopment and social and political stability. Those risks are real and already felt. 3 The results of climate change will cause natu- ral disasters, food shortages and displace- ment of peoples. In addition, the impact of climate change will signifi cantly intensify already existing threats to the point where they could trigger instability and violent confl ict. 4 Yet, climate change can be man- aged through an effective early warning and response system.

As will be noted below, depend- ing on the context of analysis, the costs of non-traditional security threats can be more devastating for human beings than those of traditional security threats, while carrying the potential to escalate into violence and war. Innovation \u2018 human security \u2019 What are the key characteristics of the hu- man security concept? These include: (cid:129) the focus on the individual and the popu- lation as the referent objects of security (a unique characteristic of the human secu- rity approach); (cid:129) the recognition that the focus on the se- curity of individuals and the population is at least as important as security of states/national; (cid:129) the recognition that investments in na- tional military security (by maintaining armies to ward off potential external en- emies) seem misplaced when most people are killed through environmental disas- ters (drought, fl oods, earthquakes, etc.) and disease; (cid:129) the recognition that the security infrastruc- ture must go beyond national actors to include sub-national, regional and global efforts to respond to local, cross-border and global threats that affect individuals and communities; Proper preparation through a human security focus: early analysis, monitoring, warning and response Climate change has the potential of greatly affecting human security levels among af- fected populations. The operationalisation of human security, a concept that focuses on the survival and well-being of individu- als and populations \u2014 with marked positive effects on state security and stability \u2014 can serve as the foundation for effective adapta- tion and mitigation policies. The human security approach asserts that the frustration of and threats to the basic hu- man needs of individuals and communities leads to human suffering, social and commu- nal deterioration, and therefore to violence in its many direct and structural manifesta- tions. This is a cyclical relationship. On the other hand, however, if individuals and com- munities feel secure and protected from the existential threats that emanate from social, political and economic injustice, military vi- olence, environmental disruptions or natural disasters \u2014 that is, if their basic human secu- rity is guaranteed \u2014 human suffering on an individual level and confl ict and violence on communal, regional and international levels can be signifi cantly reduced. It is important to note that the concept of human security focuses not only on military confl ict and its consequences for civilians but Violent confl ict and its impact on stable and instable nations and regions alike is of great concern to international organisations who are called upon prevent the escalation of climate change-induced stress to social and political tensions, crises and armed violence. The exact impact of climate change on po- litical stability can at best be assumed. The Oxford Research Group speaks of \u2018a global catastrophe costing millions of lives in wars and natural disasters\u2019 and \u2018resulting persist- ent food shortages and even famines [that] would lead to increased suffering, greater social unrest and the pressure of greatly in- creased migration.\u2019 5 While the IPCC reports that confl icts are among multiple stresses affecting exposure, sensitivity and adapta- tion capacity among populations confronted with the impact of climate change, it does not specifi cally outline the impact of cli- mate change on the likelihood of new cli- mate change-induced confl icts. Such a link cannot be determined. Research has shown that there is no mono-causal, direct link be- tween environmental degradation or climate change and the outbreak of violent confl ict. 6 Negative impacts of climate change cannot be understood or mitigated outside the larger political, economic and social conditions and threats characterising an affected society. However, it is safe to expect that the higher the level of instability and fragility due to other threats, the greater will be the impact of climate change. 5 Oxford Research Group, Global Responses to Global Threats: Sustainable security for the 21 st century, Briefi ng Paper, June 2006, pp. 6\u20137. 6 Simon Mason, Albrecht Schnabel, Adrian Muller, Rina Alluri and Christian Schmid, Linking Environment and Confl ict Prevention \u2014 The role of the United Nations.

        "[ 394 ] then the appropriate security policy would focus on prevention instruments and risk re- duction strategies for their causes\u2019. Thus, \u2018[w] hile collective violence causes a great many premature deaths and disabilities, other types of injury cause an even greater number\u2019. 9 According to statistics prepared by the World Health Organisation, in 2005 (the most current year for which data was available), 17 million people worldwide died of commu- nicable diseases, among them 2.8 million of HIV/AIDS; 1.7 million of diarrhoea-related sicknesses; 900,000 of malaria; 3.7 million of respiratory infection; and 2.4 million of perinatal conditions. Non-communicable diseases were responsible for the deaths of 35.3 million people, among them 17.5 mil- lion from cardiovascular diseases and 7.5 million from cancers. In comparison, 5.4 million people died of injuries \u2014 3.7 mil- lion of unintentional violence (including 1.3 million road accidents); and 1.7 million of intentional violence, of which 912,000 were self-infl icted (suicide), 600,000 due to inter- personal violence (homicide), and 184,000 as a result of collective violence. 10 This further strengthens the argument em- anating from human security thinking that investments in national military security global trends, and [\u2026] current responses to those trends are likely to increase, rather than decrease, the risks of future terror- ist attacks\u2019. 8 The group identifi ed four root causes of confl ict and insecurity in today\u2019s world: climate change, competition over resources, marginalisation of the majority of the world and global militarisation. The interdependence between these four factors seems apparent: negative consequences of climate change will intensify competition over increasingly scarce and fought-over resources, which will further add to the growing marginalisation and deprivation of the poorest, while continuing investments in traditional military defence and security assets will divert resources away from ad- dressing the most pressing human security threats. In other words, resources urgently required to address the threats at hand are diverted to prepare for traditional, famil- iar, but often much less signifi cant threats given the magnitude of socio-economic and environmental threats compounded by cli- mate change. To put this argument into perspective, a recent study undertaken for the SIPRI Year- book 2007 argues, \u2018[i]f the ultimate objective of security is to save human beings from preventable premature death and disability, (cid:129) the parallel focus on the alleviation of threats and efforts to strengthen affected populations\u2019 coping capacities to adapt to ongoing human insecurity.

This paradigm has continued to dominate attitudes to international se- curity, even though the global trend in ma- jor armed confl ict and interstate wars has continued to decrease in the post-Cold War era and new challenges have emerged to threaten peace and security.

Designing of effective responses to human insecurity and undesired follow-on effects such as the outbreak of armed violence de- pends on careful, context-focused analyses of threats and mitigation measures. The fi rst step consists of a thorough threat analysis, followed in the second step by a careful analysis and assessment of past, on- going and required responses for each threat. What are the main threats in a given con- text? How are they best addressed and how are they or will they be affected by climate change? 11 The third step consists of the selection and examination of the most severe threats in a selected context, as well as opportunities for timely, effective and feasible responses. This involves making diffi cult and strate- gic choices, based on available means and resources. The focus should be on the most severe threats where the combination of haz- ard and vulnerability turns a threat into a \u2018life-threatening\u2019 and existential one; and on strategies to address causes (not only symp- toms) that allow for cooperative measures by itary stability, the impact of the same con- sequences of climate change will be much more severe. It will more rapidly amplify existing cleavages and instability, trigger escalation to further tension, while little capacity and resources exist to mitigate the onslaught of climate change-induced threats. Thus, if we assume that climate change will continue, that its negative con- sequences will affect all countries world- wide, and that its impact feeds on and in- creases threats already affecting a society, then the most severe consequences of cli- mate change can be effectively resolved by addressing already prevalent threats, par- ticularly those that are most susceptible to climate change-induced impact. The follow- ing section will offer an approach that will help in pinpointing those exact threats. Towards a context-relevant analysis of human security threats and responses Five issues are key to effective human in- security mitigation: 1. Context-specifi c threat identifi cation and analysis; 2. Threat, context and actor-specific designs of preventive measures and countermeasures; 3. Targeted prevention of state-based and non-state-based violence through multi- actor strategies; must be re-thought \u2014 and possibly re-allo- cated \u2014 when by far most people are killed by preventable diseases compounded by poverty and environmental impediments. Climate change as a \u2018hyper threat\u2019: a powerful amplifi er of existing threats Climate change-induced environmen- tal disasters have the potential of bringing major catastrophes upon countries already weakened by fragile political, economic, social or environmental conditions. They are likely to create problems that will, in combination with other factors, generate human suffering, economic decline and political instability. The negative conse- quences of climate change serve as power- ful \u2018amplifi ers\u2019 of already existing problems and threats to human and state security. In the absence of such threats, the impact of climate change is less severe and enough resources might be available to invest in averting its most serious consequences. If a country is already stable, prosperous and without signifi cant social tensions, resourc- es can be targeted at the negative fallout of climate change. In this case adaptation is possible without risking social, political, economic and security breakdown.

Contact with these actors and a thorough understanding of their needs and opportunities for action are critically important throughout the entire process. 5. Implementation of envisioned measures as short, medium and long-term activities; either within existing or creation of new policies and programmes. 6. Evaluation of measures taken: evaluation results are to be incorporated into con- tinuous monitoring. Conclusion It is undoubtedly crucial that the causes for climate change must be addressed. Over time, this may halt and possibly reverse climate change and its destructive impact. However, how feasible is this approach, given continuing global demographic, eco- nomic and energy demand growth? How feasible is the approach, given the capac- ity of the top (and possibly middle) third of the world\u2019s population to adapt to climate change impacts while the bottom third suf- fers the most but is also least able to im- prove its resilience? Clearly, key contributors (polluters) to climate change must agree to effective measures (such as the Kyoto Pro- tocol and its successor) to halt and reverse greenhouse emissions before new polluters can be expected to join. Still, the costs of article, a human security-based early warn- ing and response system would consist of the following six components: 1. The threat analysis and identifi cation of key threats that require continuous moni- toring; followed by continuous monitoring (collection of data and information); 2. The analysis and assessment of collect- ed information (structural data, statistics, event data, etc.), focusing among others on the following points: (cid:129) type and extent of the threat; (cid:129) extent of the risk (who is being threat- ened by whom, when, where and with which impact; which gaps exist in ad- aptation and mitigation?); (cid:129) scenarios of escalation and de- escalation; (cid:129) assessment of existing and new preven- tive and counter-measures; (cid:129) development of specifi c actor-related measures; (cid:129) development of implementation strate- gies for the required measures; (cid:129) feedback to and correction of the threat analysis (step 1). 3. Early warning along with policy recom- mendations requires knowledge about rel- evant target groups and implementation actors, including their capacities, needs and opportunities for action. 4. Infl uence of policy and programme pri- orities of targeted local, national, re- both state and non-state actors. Particular attention must be paid to the role of climate change in causing and triggering direct and structural violence. We need to ask: (cid:129) is climate change-induced impact felt lo- cally, nationally, and/or across borders? (cid:129) what are the results of climate change for each threat experienced in a particular geographic context? (cid:129) how does climate change affect those threats (worsen, improve or mutate al- ready existing threats)? (cid:129) how are existing threats intensifi ed (in scope, severity and duration), how are responses obstructed (or in some cases aided)? (cid:129) which additional efforts are required to manage the impact of climate change on existing threats and their management? At this point indicators to measure trends in the escalation and de-escalation of threats as well as sources and techniques for the collection of relevant data are chosen, and monitoring, warning and response mecha- nisms are put in place. Using this framework as the basis for identifying human security threats will help identify priority threats and entry points for effective counter measures. The response side of this equation will re- main a challenge; however, as the following section argues, not an elusive one.

Depending on the focus of information collection, political sensitivity varies, and therefore the diffi culties for those collecting and sharing information vary. It also depends on the type of information: collecting sensitive (and even less sensitive) information in a closed political system and society for external political actors can be a dangerous task. Civil society organisations, both local and external, can be subject to threats if they are perceived to pursue activities that under- mine the interests of the political authorities. Therefore, there is a limit to the degree to which civil society actors can pursue roles that are too sensitive to pursue by inter- national actors \u2014 especially if they do not protect them. Collecting such information in an open political system and society is of course less problematic. In those cases, civil society actors are closer to the ground than international actors, closer to society and its dynamics, and in a better position to judge the relevance of a certain event or development for its impact on stability or instability. Role of the EU and international donors The EU can serve as a force of collabora- tive, integrated action between various peace partners involved in one or more stages of the Early warning and response Climate change and its devastating con- sequences for the most affected and vulner- able countries calls for the need to revisit efforts taken during the past years in im- proving early warning and response ideas, initiatives and actions. EW&R systems are necessary and, if properly designed, they will be capable of alleviating some of the harshest consequences of climate change. It will be important to move beyond a sin- gle focus on violent confl ict or armed vio- lence and consider the entire range of threats that pose lethal risks to affected popula- tions. Conducting systematic analyses and generating effective ideas for response will improve the chances that information will lead to better understanding, more specifi c and informed warning, and timely and ef- fective mitigation. Challenges in information exchange Especially in an age of information over- fl ow, exchanges between actors involved in stabilising peace and preventing instability (\u2018peace partners\u2019) are crucial: While there is an overfl ow of information, much of it is ir- relevant, repetitive, duplicated, scattered \u2014 a great amount of information that does not add up to much if it is not integrated. This makes it all the more important to systemati- cally collect, consult, share and analyse in- formation. Everyone\u2019s time and resources are limited. It is therefore important to have the best, most accurate and relevant information action are likely to be much lower than the costs of inaction (according to one estimate 0.12 per cent reduction of average annual GDP growth rate)? 12 Focus on adaptation Even if climate change can be halted and reversed in the long run, some impacts of global warming are irreversible, and con- sequences will be felt \u2014 and need to be re- sponded to \u2014 for some time: (cid:129) adaptation mechanisms will have to be put in place to allow populations to survive and cope with climate change-induced or intensifi ed socio-economic threats; (cid:129) the resilience and coping capacity of those affected (particularly those most vulnera- ble) to the impacts of climate change must be strengthened; (cid:129) existing factors of vulnerability (other threats and their causes) must be ad- dressed to release the social, economic and political capital necessary to manage new threats created by climate change; and (cid:129) it would be wise to expect and prepare for severe repercussions of climate change for existing problems and threats. Responses must be taken immediately and, separately and jointly, at local, national and regional/international levels \u2014 by individu- als, households, civil society actors, state governments, regional organisations (such as the EU) and the UN. 12 van Ypersele, \u2018Climate change and cities: the IPCC case for action,\u2019 p. 4.

        "[ 399 ] Introduction The shocking events of Tuesday 11 Septem- ber 2001 once again threw the spotlight on a corner of the vast territory, large demography and rather unstable political geography of what we call the Muslim world. The Muslim world, comprising some 50 sovereign states and large minorities in many other countries, is a well-integrated and integral part of the modern world of states. It does, however, also contain a complex and intricate web of rela- tions and forces which it periodically unleash- es on the rest of the international system. As we have witnessed, at times the points of contact have been surprisingly violent and dramatic. But on the whole, much of the energies of the Muslim world are either taken up with matters internal to that com- munity or else used up by the individual Muslim states in their efforts to make way in today\u2019s globalised socio-economic and cul- tural system. In this mode, I am often struck by how defensive the Muslim states are and how diffi cult they seem to fi nd the struggle to defend their own interests. Little room is left for forging a concerted effort to defend what are regarded to be legitimate Muslim interests. It is in this relative vacuum that the radical Islamic forces fi nd a role. Learning from history If we were to adopt a slightly longer-term view of the evolution of the Muslim world M AKING SENSE OF THE TURMOIL IN THE M USLIM WORLD Anoushivaran Ehteshami is professor of international relations and head of the School of Government and International Affairs at Durham University. He has published several books on the political situation in the Middle East. His current research revolves around fi ve over-arching themes: the Asian balance of power in the post-Cold War era; the \u2018Asianisation\u2019 of the international system; foreign and security policies of Middle East states since the end of the Cold War; the impact of globalisation on the Middle East; and good governance and democratisation efforts in the Middle East. in the modern era, which indeed we must do if we are bent on making sense of the current crisis, then we can fi nd many signs from pages of history which point to the deep structural fl aws in the way in which the Muslim states emerged onto the internation- al scene. It is my view that since the turn of the 20th century the Muslim world has been saddled by two fundamental problems. First, the collapse of the Ottoman Em- pire in the early 1920s, at one of the most important turning points in modern times, left it voiceless at the top table of interna- tional players. Without the shelter of that Islamic empire, which was not regarded as a perfect model by many Muslims outside Anatolia, the Muslim world found itself ex- posed and exploited by the bigger European powers such as Britain and France. This was after the humiliations which had followed Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s invasion of Egypt in 1798 and the systematic weakening of the Persian and Ottoman empires in the face of European encroachments in the 19th cen- tury. European colonialism in the region was often brutal and has had a profound legacy in terms of both political institutions and culture. The Muslim world has probably never re- covered, or been given the chance to re- cover, from these traumatic encounters with the West. But their sensibilities were further tested with the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 in the heart of Muslim lands and the slow removal of Palestine as a political and cultural entity. Israel\u2019s foundation, its location and Zionist ideology, have been considered by countless people in the Mus- lim world as a national and religious chal- lenge, and the systematic subjugation of the Palestinian people by Israel as a conspiracy to deprive the Palestinians of their rightful homeland and the occupation of all of Holy Jerusalem by Jews. The second problem was associated with the very nature of the state in the Arab and the wider Muslim worlds. The modern state in many parts of the Muslim world is not only largely a European creation, where even its boundaries are often those defi ned by the colonial powers, but one which is overwhelmingly reliant on a highly cen- tralised state machinery and a patriarchal infrastructure. While the former has impreg- nated these states with a serious legitimacy problem, which was severely tested in the Kuwait crisis of 1990-1991 for example, the latter has made the elites of these countries more impervious to the calls of their citi- zens for a bigger share of the economic and political pie.

In prac- tice, the broad American neo-conservative agenda for global change has galvanised its opponents, from France and China to politi- cal Islam, into action. As a consequence, so long as the forces of radical Islam interpret every American act as hostile and an attack on Islam they will rally against it, inevitably plotting a violent response. The cycle of violence deepens the more intensive the interactions become be- tween the Muslim world and the political and commercial forces of the West. The image of the United States as the New Rome merely makes it easier for the radical Islamists to justify their own violent acts on the basis of the enemy\u2019s threatening grand design. In sum, it is reasonable to suggest that radical Islam has failed to gain state power, has failed in its main mission of \u2018liberating\u2019 Muslim lands from Western infl uence, and convince the Muslim masses of the virtues of its brand of jihad. But this is not the same as concluding that political Islam has lost the capacity to act, to remain militant, to under- take sophisticated military-style operations, or to generally pose a serious security chal- lenge to Western interests worldwide. As the West is now revisiting another corner of the Muslim world it is perhaps time to refl ect on how the same forces of act as defenders and protectors of the greater Muslim rights: to become the Muslim com- munity\u2019s latter-day cultural nationalists. In the face of the Islamists\u2019 uncompromising claims to righteousness and protectors of the divine right, the rulers fi nd themselves impotent to act and open to sharp criticism from their opponents for bowing to Western pressure or for harbouring pro-Western sen- timents. They are, in short, accused of being \u2018Westoxicated\u2019 \u2014 a diffi cult label to shrug off if they are seen to be aiding the West in search of its own interests. Sadly, as in today\u2019s world the mediating power for the expression of frustration is nothing more articulate than the faceless force of globalisation itself, little chance of a genuine dialogue emerging between the parties seems likely. This much is depress- ingly clear in the aftermath of the US Em- bassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 and Washington\u2019s response to the bombings. The statement of the \u2018Islamic International Front for Fighting Jews and Crusaders\u2019, issued soon after the US missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan, sounded ominous: \u2018Holy struggle operations will con- tinue until American forces withdraw from the land of Muslims\u2019. The world has indeed entered a new age since the ascendancy of the neo-conserva- tive global vision in the United States in the new millennium. In this new world order, the \u2018neo-cons\u2019 fi nd themselves lined up against the neo-fundamentalist forces of political and partly by the ill-defi ned goals of eco- nomic liberalisation and IMF-style structural adjustment, have enabled the radical Islamic forces \u2014 who have been able to fl ourish as other (more secular) political forces were marginalised or exterminated by the ruling elites \u2014 to step into the breach and challenge the rulers in the Muslim states. Their chal- lenge is felt from Indonesia to Pakistan and Turkey, in the key Arab countries of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Egypt, as well as in the North African Muslim states of Alge- ria, Tunisia, Morocco and Libya. Their slo- gan is a simple one: \u2018Islam is the Solution\u2019. While for the most part the radical groups remained locked in a struggle with their own ruling regimes, with their quarrels largely confi ned to the territory of the country con- cerned, the Islamists are now increasingly fi nding themselves battling much great- er outside forces. The infi ltration of out- side forces they view as beachheads for the \u2018Americanisation\u2019 of the Muslim way of life, as a bombardment of alien and corrupting values and infl uences. This, they believe, requires an international response, which partly explains the existence of international networks of Islamist groups. Indeed, as the forces of globalisation \u2014 from the realm of commerce to those of tel- evision, food, clothes and the entertainment media \u2014 prize open the doors of traditional Muslim societies and challenge the norms and value systems of the local populations, so do they encourage the Islamist forces to ",

        "[ 403 ] Introduction It would be a gross exaggeration to claim that the terrorism planned and carried out by the Al Qaeda network is the greatest threat to global and transregional security. In the longer, or perhaps even the medium term, threats to global environmental security are far more serious. Nor should we loose sight of the dangers of major inter-state wars es- calating and leading to the use of nuclear weapons. Arms control and non-prolifera- tion agreements have so far failed to pre- vent the emergence of new nuclear weapon states, for example, India and Pakistan, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that there are now 40 states with suffi cient civil nuclear technol- ogy to produce a nuclear weapon in a matter of months. Many observers are convinced that the Iranian regime\u2019s nuclear enrich- ment programme is aimed at creating a nu- clear weapon capability, despite Tehran\u2019s repeated denials. It should hardly be neces- sary to point out that nuclear weapon pro- liferation, both vertical and horizontal, in such confl ict-prone regions as the South and Southwest Asia and the Middle East poses a major threat to transregional and global security. Unlike the bipolar confrontation that char- acterised the Cold War, the opening decades of the 21 st century have been marked by a L ESSONS FROM THE STRUGGLE AGAINST A L Q AEDA \u2014 OUTLINING A HOLISTIC M ULTI -P RONGED EU RESPONSE Paul Wilkinson is Emeritus Professor of International Relations and Chairman of the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, University of St Andrews, UK.

Nor should we overlook the dangers of in- ter-state confl icts using chemical or biologi- cal weaponry. The materials and the methods to weaponise them are very accessible and cheap to acquire. The current strategic environment also remains vulnerable to the threat of major conventional wars between non-nuclear states. The ending of the Cold War, far from extinguishing ethnic, religious and religio- political confl icts and bitter power rival- ries over resources and territory has given way to multi-polar confl icts, many of which could develop into major conventional wars. Moreover, the proliferation of conventional weapons has been allowed to proceed with- out any effective controls/restraints by the UN or other international organisations. It is also the case that the trend towards US unilateralism and George W. Bush\u2019s doc- trine of preventative war have, sadly, made it more diffi cult to dissuade states from seek- ing to acquire nuclear weapons. It has made it far harder to bring constructive diplomacy of confl ict prevention and confl ict resolu- tion to bear in time to prevent hostilities and to halt the rapid escalation of confl ict (e.g. the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which has set back the Lebanese economy by more than 20 years). The concepts of war, terrorism and \u2018terror wars\u2019 War and terrorism are conceptually dis- tinct, and historically the weapon of terror- ism has often been used without any wider guerrilla or conventional war taking place. Terrorism is the use or threat of extreme violence to create a climate of fear among the wider audience than the immediate vic- tims of the violence. It involves random and symbolic targets, including civilians. War can be briefl y defi ned as armed confl ict be- tween two or more parties, nations or states. (The days when the term \u2018war\u2019 could be re- stricted purely to confl icts between states are long past). However, since the late 20 th century we have seen an increasing number of confl icts in which the weapon of terror is employed as an auxiliary weapon by one or more par- ties involved in war. In these \u2018terror wars\u2019, as they have been termed, there are, typi- cally, no front lines; attacks on civilians become the norm, particularly savage vio- lence is used in \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019 of whole ",
        "[ 404 ] and professionalism and determined efforts to suppress terrorist fi nances and supplies of weapons and explosives. Additionally, there need to be measures to prevent pro- liferation of WMD materials and technology to terrorists, an intensive \u2018hearts and minds\u2019 campaign to prevent young Muslims both in the Islamic world and among the Muslim diaspora communities, from being recruit- ed into extremist groups and groomed and indoctrinated in preparation to carry out suicide bombings and other kinds of terror- ist attacks. If we fail to win the battle for hearts and minds the world will face future generations of suicide bombers fi lled with hatred and a fanatical commitment to wag- ing \u2018global jihad\u2019. Assessment of the results of the struggle against Al Qaeda as of 11 November 2007 There have been numerous claims from journalists and self-styled \u2018experts\u2019 on Al Qaeda, who have claimed that the movement is no more than a label or \u2018brand name\u2019 and that the core leadership no longer has any real infl uence. I believe that these attempts to write the obituary of Al Qaeda are, to say the least, premature. The movement has al- ways been rather different from traditional terrorist groups. It is a globally dispersed network of cells and affi liates who look to Al Qaeda\u2019s leaders for ideological leader- ship and inspiration and strategic direction. The ideological and propaganda task of the leadership is now largely provided through the internet and through information of the Qaeda network\u2019s declared \u2018global jihad\u2019 is being waged in many countries without any accompaniment of a wider war. It is effective intelligence, police and judicial cooperation between many countries that is needed if Al Qaeda\u2019s terrorists, based in more than 60 countries, are to be ultimately suppressed or neutralised. The military certainly has a valuable contribution to make in coun- tering some aspects of Al Qaeda\u2019s global campaign, but it is unfair and unrealistic to expect them to bear the burden of suppress- ing a global movement of extremists well hidden among the civilian population in dozens of cities. Last but not least, the term \u2018war on terror\u2019 provides an unintended gift to Al Qaeda propagandists, implying that they have the status of legitimate freedom fi ghters on behalf of a \u2018victimised\u2019 world of Islam. My own view is that \u2018the struggle against Al Qaeda\u2019, a phrase favoured by the EU, is far more accurate and useful. In order to succeed this struggle must be both multilateral and multi-pronged. In spite of its status as the world\u2019s only superpower and its huge economic and military resourc- es, the United States is unable to suppress the globally dispersed Al Qaeda network single-handedly. It desperately needs the full support and cooperation of all its allies in the Coalition Against Terrorism estab- lished in the aftermath of 9/11. A winning strategy to suppress or at least marginalise Al Qaeda has got to be multi-pronged with international intelligence, police and judicial cooperation of the highest possible quality communities, and often they are massacres, mass rape and torture. There are major vio- lations of the Geneva Convention, often by all sides, and there are no easy exits from such confl icts because they are character- ised by intense ethnic or religious hatred because both sides see themselves as fi ght- ing a total war. Terror wars can go on for decades, apparently unresponsive to UN or other efforts to broker ceasefi res or to pro- mote peace processes. Chauvinistic leaders and ideologues are in many cases capable of mobilising large numbers of their fellow nationals to support war (e.g. Milo\u02c7 sevi\u00b4c and Tudjman in the bitter civil war in the former Yugoslavia). These terror wars can lead to massive fatalities among civilians (e.g. Iraq since 2003). Our progress in science and technology has evidently not been accom- panied by any reduction in the barbarisa- tion of warfare. However, while \u2018terror wars\u2019 may be an ac- curate description for confl icts such as that being waged in parts of Iraq, there are con- siderable problems involved in the use of the phrase \u2018war on terror\u2019 adopted by President George W. Bush after 9/11 as the umbrella label for the global response to terrorism. The term is far too wide to be useful and, as in the phrase \u2018war on crime\u2019, appears to be more of a slogan or a rallying cry. Moreover, the term \u2018war\u2019 arouses expectations among the public that the predominant response to the Al Qaeda\u2019s terrorist campaign should be military and that military action will suf- fi ce to defeat the terrorists. In reality the Al ",

All the evidence from recent police investigations and trials of jihad con- spiracies in Europe and elsewhere proves be- yond doubt that Al Qaeda is still very much in business. It is the worst terrorist threat to international security because: (cid:129) it is explicitly committed to mass fatality attacks; (cid:129) it uses coordinated no-warning suicide attacks, the most diffi cult type of terror- ism to prevent in an \u2018open\u2019 democratic society; (cid:129) it has \u2018global reach\u2019; (cid:129) it is \u2018incorrigible\u2019, i.e. it shows no sign of any change to greater pragmatism or modifi cation of its absolutist ideology or its utterly ruthless methodology; (cid:129) it is ideologically committed to waging a terrorist campaign against not only the United States and Israel, but also all the countries in the Coalition Against Ter- rorism and all the Muslim countries that cooperate with Western countries, which they condemn as \u2018Apostate\u2019 countries. In short, Al Qaeda is the most danger- ous non-state perpetrator of terror to have emerged in modern history. It is clearly a prime duty of the EU to struggle to suppress it because it not only poses a major threat ",
        "[ 406 ] Protecting the EU homeland Attacks and attempted attacks in Spain, Germany, the UK, Italy and other EU coun- tries underline the importance of strength- ening our homeland security. To prevent radicalisation and recruit- ment to terrorism we need to work for an EU-wide partnership with moderate Muslim leaders to help ensure that Al Qaeda\u2019s claim to be \u2018true Islam\u2019 is totally discredited. (This effort will be helped by Al Qaeda\u2019s ruthless and deadly terrorist attacks in which hun- dreds of fellow Muslims have been killed \u2014 a huge strategic blunder by Al Qaeda). Let us ensure that our own preparedness for dealing with the emergency of mass-cas- ualty terrorist attack is greatly improved. The Al Qaeda network is capable of using tactics such as suicide vehicle bombs and suicide airline attacks, but also could po- tentially use some types of CBRN materi- als (e.g. for using \u2018dirty bombs\u2019 or RDDs). It would be foolish to discount \u2018worse case\u2019 scenarios. Our police and emergency serv- ices require the best possible equipment, training and real-time exercises to prepare for such contingencies. jority of the public and even EU govern- ments appear to understand. Currently there are simply not enough troops on the ground to attain the level of security and stabil- ity needed for reconstruction and economic development so desperately required if the democratically elected government headed by President Karzai is to survive. More EU countries should come aboard to help the hard-pressed troops in the front-line against the Taliban. The role of the military in helping the \u2018front-line\u2019 countries against Al Qaeda Military forces are ideal for certain coun- ter-terrorist tasks, but it is a huge mistake to assume they are a panacea. Sophisticated modern terrorists of the Al Qaeda network know how to hide and operate covertly in cities around the world and how to melt into their surroundings and to keep their communications secret. Over dependence on military operations and heavy-handed use of fi repower in civilian areas, which is likely to cause heavy casualties among in- nocent civilians, is a huge strategic blunder, fuelling support and recruitment for terror- ist groups.

The greatest need is still for high-quality human intelligence (HUMINT) on Al Qaeda network intentions and plans. The large number of foiled and disrupted Al Qaeda-linked attacks shows that intelligence has improved greatly over the past seven years and enabled more conspir- acies to be prevented from reaching frui- tion. However, there are still many gaps and counterproductive barriers to the exchange of operational counter-terrorism intelligence within the EU.

        "[ 407 ] Introduction Hawala means \u2018transfer\u2019 in Arabic and refers to a traditional, informal and effi - cient funds transfer method used by millions of expatriates to send remittances to their families around the world. Several studies emphasize hawala \u2019s economic and human- itarian signifi cance. In the midst of calls to shut down all potential means used by militants to fi nance their terror, the First International Conference on Hawala , held in 2002 in Abu Dhabi, was successful in of- fering an opportunity to examine hawala beyond media sensationalism and rushed policy responses. Nevertheless, any optimism that the con- ference would lead to appropriate and ef- fective regulatory arrangements was soon frustrated by hurried approaches at both the national and international levels that seem to be more fi tting for formal insti- tutions than informal networks. Indeed, some of the measures introduced in recent years have caused serious damage to ethnic communities dependent on their relatives\u2019 remittances. The argument of this chapter develops through the following main points: (cid:129) hawala serves honest people as well as serious criminals; F ORMALISING THE INFORMAL WHILE NEGLECTING TRADE TRANSPARENCY : ISSUES IN THE REGULATION OF H AWALA AND FINANCIAL CONTROLS AGAINST TERRORISM Nikos Passas is Professor of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, Boston, USA.

He has published a number of books on corruption, organised and trans-border crime. He regularly serves as an expert witness in court cases and as a consultant to fi nancial institutions, law fi rms, consulting companies, academic and policy institutions, the UN, World Bank, IMF, and government agencies in numerous countries.

(cid:129) fi nancial controls of terrorism are critical but no panacea; (cid:129) there has been a counterproductive over- emphasis on hawala as uniquely vulner- able to abuse; (cid:129) current regulatory arrangements fail to meet stated objectives, and (cid:129) careful consideration of sound empirical evidence and genuine dialogue with the sector are indispensable. These points will be addressed as we ex- amine the appeal of hawala \u2014 the regulatory objectives, challenges and risks. We con- clude with implications for a sensible and evidence-based policy. The appeal of Hawala Hawala originated in the Indian subcon- tinent and constitutes one of numerous in- formal value transfer systems operating glo- bally (El Qorchi, Maimbo and Wilson, 2003; Passas, 1999). Deliveries are made in cash quickly, cheaply, and conveniently in places where banking services are unavailable, ex- pensive, or unreliable. Two main aspects can be distinguished in the hawala business: the sending and receiv- ing of money (the relationships between a hawaladar [ hawala operator] and his or her clients, and the settlement process (relation- ships among intermediaries). The fi rst part is relatively straightforward. Clients hand in their cash and request an equivalent amount to be delivered in local or, more rarely, another specifi ed currency. Hawaladars and those acting as their agents accept cash in their premises \u2014 usually some other business, such as a corner store, a deli- catessen, a music or electronics business, a travel agency \u2014 or may go to their clients\u2019 workplace or home for a cash pickup. In most cases, no fees are discussed. Rather, the transaction cost is factored into the quoted exchange rate or the amount that will be de- livered overseas in local currency for their US dollars, pounds, dirhams, riyals, etc. At the end of each day, hawaladars con- solidate all deals into ledgers for each agent and counterpart they do business with, in- cluding a running balance. The funds transfer requests are organised into payment instruc- tion sheets \u2014 containing the amounts and the name, address and telephone number of the recipient \u2014 and faxed to counterparts in other parts of the world. The serial number of a ru- pee or other note in the hands of the intended recipient is also faxed: it is often used for identifi cation. Some communications may also be done by e-mail or telephone. Ha- waladars maintain such records at least un- til accounts are settled; in labour-importing countries (e.g. USA, Europe or the UAE) ledg- ers are often kept for several years. ",
        "[ 408 ] mal methods involve charges and fees re- quiring the remitters to add US $1.32 to US $27.22 to the cost. In short, better rates and lower costs make hawala the best op- tion fi nancially. Other advantages include having convenient home delivery or pickup, interacting with people speaking the same language and from the same region, avoid- ing bureaucratic procedures and paperwork, preserving confi dentiality, and achieving fast delivery even in the remotest villages. The relationship of trust and the mutual in- by banks and exchange houses, and West- ern Union fees. In short, hawala offers much better exchange rates and no fees at all. The fi nancial benefi ts to remitters\u2019 fami- lies become clearer in Table 2, which uses Pakistan as an example and compares the amounts received by benefi ciaries in local currency for about US $100 sent from Du- bai. Hawala beats all the competition by far. The amount received in cash is higher than all other options. Moreover, all for- The delivery takes from a few minutes to 48 hours, depending on the urgency and the destination of the funds. Cash may be handed over at the recipients\u2019 premises or taken to their doorstep. Each hawaladar keeps a pool of cash, which enables pay- ments as soon as instructions arrive. Thus, local cash is typically used for payments on behalf of overseas clients. In this way, ac- tual fund transfers are minimised (for more details, see Passas, 2003b, 2003c, 2004b, 2006, 2006b). Hawala serves millions of immigrants from South Asia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere whose remittances are often desperately needed as a means for survival. The funds also provide important support for economic development (Ratha, 2003). Formal fi nancial institutions have recently made strong efforts to increase their share of the remittance market by lowering fees, widening their networks and using better technology. The law enforcement and regu- latory attention drawn by hawala has also increased operating costs in the informal sector. Nevertheless, hawala continues to be the best option for most immigrants and the only one for those coming from regions devastated by civil confl ict and disasters. Data updated in November 2004 from the United Arab Emirates illustrate the competi- tiveness of hawala .

        "[ 409 ] of regulation is not as necessary as many a Westerner might think. Regulatory objectives and challenges The main task is to reconcile two sets of public policy priorities. On the one hand, we must counter terrorist fi nancing, money laundering and other fi nancial crime. La- bour exporting countries are also concerned about the economic or other damage caused by hawala in local economies thirsty for foreign currency. 1 On the other hand, we need to reduce the hurdles faced by labour- ers remitting funds to their homeland and to avoid unnecessary disruptions of capital fl ows and commerce, both of which are vital to economic development. More specifi cally, the crime-control objec- tives are to (a) achieve more transparency by identifying operators and clients and by en- hancing the traceability of transactions, (b) provide a measure of deterrence and prevent abuses of funds transfer networks, (c) prevent the fi nancing of terrorist operations, and (d) collect intelligence and monitor the activities of criminal groups and extremists. The economic aims are to (a) lower the cost of remittances, (b) widen the range and increase the speed of remittance options, (c) ensure compliance, (d) protect the con- sumer, and (e) ensure a level playing fi eld for the various competitors in the remit- tance market. payments in kind, as well as through com- mercial transactions, falsifi ed invoices and third parties. Not being subject to the same rules as formal institutions and operating frequently in parallel economies through not always known third parties make the whole process susceptible to illegal uses. Commer- cial and fi nancial transactions are integral components to the settlement process. Un- fortunately, there is little to no transparency and verifi cation of transactions in the im- port/export business (Passas, 2004d, 2006c). The problem is not merely theoretical; there is evidence that money derived from drug traffi cking, illegal arms sales, body part trade, corruption, tax evasion, and all kinds of fraud have indeed moved through hawala and trading networks. In this light, leaving hawala complete- ly unregulated, as was the case in many parts of the world before 9/11, is no long- er realistic. The question is how to regu- late it (Maimbo et al., 2005; Passas, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c, 2006a). One important point to consider is that trust is a defi ning ele- ment of hawala , which makes the system not only more effi cient, but also reliable. Informal dispute-resolution mechanisms most often resolve issues among hawala- dars, and individual remitters have seldom lost their money even after law enforcement actions, accidents or bankruptcy (Maimbo, 2003; Passas, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2006a, 2006b). Hence, a consumer protection type terests of hawaladars and their clients sup- port the effi cient global hawala networks. Finally, \u2018cultural inertia\u2019 and the forces of old habits add to the hurdles faced by for- mal institutions seeking to capture a larger share of the multibillion-dollar (US dollars) global remittance market. Need for regulation At the same time, research clearly shows that hawala is vulnerable to criminal abuse, just like all other fi nancial institutions. We know that hawala clients include money launderers, militants, corrupt politicians, fraudsters and tax evaders (Carroll, 1999; Howlett, 2001; Passas, 1999, 2003 a, b, c, 2004 b, c; FATF, 2001, 2003). Legitimate clients and funds are occasionally commin- gled with illicit ones. As hawaladars use local cash pools to pay for overseas remit- tances, the father of someone sending hon- estly earned funds from the United States or UAE could actually receive the cash a cor- rupt offi cial or smuggler wishes to launder or secretly take out of the country. Most vulnerable to abuse, however, is the process of settlement among hawaladars . The cash pools on which they draw for pay- ments are always asymmetrical, as each op- erator transfers funds to and from multiple locations every day. Apart from compensa- tory payments, other ways of balancing ac- counts include formal transfers (check, wire, bank-to-bank, etc.), the use of couriers and 1 Because hawala draws on local cash pools for making remittance payments, it is feared that hawala deprives the country of valuable foreign exchange.

        "[ 410 ] ance and transparency through registration are completely undermined by an unco- ordinated patchwork of state regulations. Most US states mandate licensing. In some of them, however, the capitalisation or bond requirements amount to hundreds of thou- sands of US dollars. If a hawaladar has cli- ents in more than one jurisdiction, he would need to comply with the rules of all states (see Passas, 2006a). This is an unaffordable and non-pragmatic arrangement that effec- tively seeks to formalise the informal. At- tempting to apply to hawala rules that are appropriate to formal fi nancial institutions and corporations is unwise and unwork- able. Hawaladars are left with three options: to introduce or substantially raise fees and charges to customers, to stop offering the funds transfer service to their ethnic com- munities, or to operating without a license. However, operating without a required state license has become a federal offence. This has effectively pushed many hawaladars out of business or underground. Judging by re- ports of arrests and charges for this offence, hawala has been largely criminalised in the United States. Even in the liberal environment of the UAE, where hawala is legal and compli- ance is affordable (simple registration), hawaladars shun the limelight and would not come forward, even to attend hawala conference. Many countries are eager to heed calls by the Financial Action Task Force and others (cid:129) fi nally, assessing and measuring the ef- fects of measures and policies relative to hawala are hard, given the availability of a wide range of other informal methods that could be used by those determined to evade regulation. Thus, reduced illegal hawala activity may not necessarily be a positive development, to the extent that activities get displaced to less transparent and less understood informal value trans- fer methods (Passas, 2003c). Shortcomings of current arrangements No thorough and systematic effort has been attempted to assess the effect of poli- cies that were introduced very shortly after the 9/11 attacks. There are strong indications, however, that most of the policies \u2014 both national and international \u2014 are not pro- ducing the desired effects and may indeed be counterproductive. In South Asia and other labour-exporting countries, for example, hawala has been and remains either criminalised or outlawed. This means that certain large parts of the hawala networks are by defi nition illegal, forcing op- erators and clients to keep a low profi le and hide their business as much as they can. Some European countries, such as France and Spain, allow no informal funds transfer (IFT) opera- tions. Others require costly and burdensome procedures for de facto licensing, pushing a number of hawala operators underground. The same applies to the United States, where federal efforts to increase compli- The synchronisation of these objectives is complicated by the dilemmas of undocu- mented immigrants, who may be earning legitimate funds without authorisation to work, which means that they could not use formal institutions for remittances or other business. Another serious challenge is the harmonisation of controls internationally and regionally, as the contexts vary dramati- cally and render some rules unenforceable or unrealistic. Challenges specifi c to hawala networks include the following: (cid:129) there is often no uninterrupted transparent audit trail; (cid:129) it may be hard or impossible to interpret idiosyncratic hawala records; (cid:129) the fusion of hawala with other busi- nesses makes it diffi cult to disentangle transactions and may easily hide illicit activities; (cid:129) the interface with grey/black markets makes it harder to supervise hawala and offers opportunities to obscure transactions; (cid:129) fi ne-tuning regulations and law enforce- ment targets to avoid harm to innocent actors is particularly diffi cult and re- quires study and appreciation of ethnic, cultural, political and socio-economic specifi cities; (cid:129) ensuring a balanced approach and proper regulation of the formal sector requires the conception and implementation of rules appropriate for very different ac- tors, modus operandi and traditions; ",
        "[ 411 ] be a very useful counter-terrorism approach. Infrastructures set up for one kind of secret fi nance and smuggling can be employed by militants as well. Some of them may also team up temporarily with criminal groups. Hot spots of fi nancial crime, which abound in all continents, must be investigated. Anti-crime and counter-terrorism policies ought not to be regarded as confl icting or competing, but as complementary and mutually supportive. The most promising approach to hawala regulation, and an effi cient separator of us- ers from abusers, is through a dialogue and outreach to all stakeholders of this signifi - cant economic sector. By taking the views of hawaladars into account and by building a consensus, future compliance and trans- parency, or traceability of transactions, is far more likely. Encouraging further cost reductions and more convenient and ac- cessible formal remittance avenues would ensure the continuation of vital services to needy communities. At the domestic level, countries would be wise to harmonise their federal, state, and local rules and responses on the basis of evi- dence, appreciation, and understanding of the networks they seek to supervise and control. Internationally, it may be useful to establish specifi c policy goals and urge countries to meet them in their own way, consistent with local traditions, culture, and socio-economic conditions. In that way, we would promote a legal harmonisation while allowing for the necessary diversity and fl exibility. (cid:129) shifts to less well-known informal value transfer methods and thus less transpar- ency and traceability of transactions. Contrary to popular perception, there were no hawala transactions in the 9/11 terror- ist operations. Myths about huge amounts raised and made available to Al Qaeda and associated groups have been dispelled (Na- tional Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004). Terrorism is inex- pensive and fi nanced through a wide range of methods. Hawala has certainly been used to transfer militants\u2019 funds, but it is not the most important vehicle. Assumptions about a centrally and rationally organised Al Qaeda have also been rejected, as evidence points to loose networks unifi ed by ideas and beliefs rather than structures. Militants tend to raise their operational funds locally and through ordinary crime, such as robbery, kidnapping, blackmail, fraud or commodity smuggling. Furthermore, because of the strong empha- sis on naming, shaming, freezing and seizing the assets of suspected supporters of terrorist groups, we may expect groups to use funds transfer methods and infrastructures akin to money laundering. Thus, instead of hiding the illegal source of money, people would now want to hide themselves as the source of funds given to extremist groups. Conclusion: the way forward As we try to avoid \u2018collateral damage\u2019 and undermine our own objectives, the fi ght against transnational crime could turn out to to apply anti-money laundering and terrorist fi nance recommendations and rules. How- ever, interviews with offi cials suggest that despite formal compliance with such inter- national standards, enforcement is problem- atic and impractical. Attempts to formalise the informal equal efforts to alter the age- old traditional networks, which successfully resisted prohibitions and authoritarian re- gimes in the past. The chances of succeeding are slim, particularly if the informal sector is not consulted. The risks of unsuccessful regulation Financial controls are essential and neces- sary. They deter and prevent serious crimes, offer investigative leads to detect and arrest offenders, reduce the harm of planned or committed crimes, and generate opportuni- ties for intelligence collection. However, if our aspirations get lofty, there is the danger of causing more problems than we solve. All of the objectives set out above risk be- ing frustrated, and we can expect the fol- lowing responses: (cid:129) a reduction of the positive economic ef- fects of labour remittances; (cid:129) fewer, more expensive remittance options available to expatriates; (cid:129) unnecessary criminalisation of legitimate actors; (cid:129) higher human costs to the families of immigrants; (cid:129) alienation of large segments of the popu- lation who would be helpful in counter- terror coalitions; ",
        "[ 412 ] changes over time, interface with legitimate actors, etc. We will be able to know what sets of of- fences are committed by what networks of offenders using what types of methods and routes. The relationships can be classifi ed or coded by intensity/volume, duration, fre- quency and signifi cance (whether they rep- resent the only resource of other offenders or offenders are able and willing to diversify and reduce their dependence). Mapping such illicit landscapes will help strategically, operationally and preventively. The users of such knowledge are legion and include the following: (cid:129) investigators and prosecutors looking for suspects or likely modus operandi or juris- diction through which cases were commit- ted or assets may have crossed \u2014 cutting down on usual suspects or likely modus operandi and jurisdictions to look at of mutual legal assistance requests or other formal and informal cooperation; (cid:129) asset recovery, especially in grand corrup- tion cases, where sophisticated methods and professionals in multiple jurisdictions are often involved; (cid:129) strategic planning: enabling the analysis of systemic or other vulnerabilities and threat/risk assessments for both private and public organisations and actors; (cid:129) understanding how legal and illegal ac- tors interface (not only for antithetical interests, but also when their relationship may be symbiotic. This is important when (cid:129) \u2018facts by repetition\u2019 on security, terror- ism, organised crime and corruption cas- es, when intelligence and open-source information is distorted, inaccurate or misinterpreted; (cid:129) jurisdictional fi rewalls of information and knowledge slowing down the process and impeding investigations; (cid:129) the focus on particular offences may lead to a neglect of ways in which a variety of serious crimes may be committed by or through the same actors and networks; (cid:129) open source information is not collect- ed, organised and analysed in a system- atic fashion. There may be data available through courts, media, scholarly publi- cations, and think-tank, government or other reports. If they are scattered and not readily accessible, under-resourced anti- corruption actors cannot avail of them. In addition, in cases where the suspects are fugitive or the cases are settled without trial, the data on what they did how and with whom, will not make it to any com- mon knowledge base. Those who directly worked in these cases move to the next job while the valuable information is shelved or destroyed. A project designed to map illicit and corrupt networks will address all of these problems and make inroads into effective crime control, anti-corruption action and accountability. This project would look in depth into the division of labour, geograph- ic location, methods of operation of cor- rupt actors, nexus with other serious crimes, Regulation will be most effective to the extent it becomes truly cross-agency and international. It must be emphasized, how- ever, that fi nancial control will never work while trade remains non-transparent. Gigan- tic sections of the world economy currently operate \u2018under the radar\u2019 and constitute an enormous risk for proliferation of crime, ter- rorism and WMD. Precious stones and met- als have received some attention, but it is all trade that needs to be better regulated (Passas, 2004d). Once trade transactions are transparent, they must also be connected with fi nancial transactions. This is the only way genuine transparency and accountabil- ity may be achieved. Given the lack of trade transparency and threats it poses, the recent emphasis on risk- based approaches led by good evidence and sound analysis, a long-term study focused on the mapping of illicit networks is essential. Criminals rarely specialise in one kind of crime. When we look into the acts of serious offenders, we see that they usually commit multiple offences that transcend the jurisdic- tional arrangements we have for investiga- tions and prosecutions internationally and domestically. Investigators and prosecutors may be overwhelmed with the tasks involved in identifying corrupt assets, tracing them to different countries, chasing witnesses and suspects, identifying all co-conspirators and facilitators, fi ling mutual legal assistance requests, etc. The cost of these operations is often daunting. Additional hurdles are raised by: ",

(cid:129) causal analysis and remedial action plan- ning: insights will be offered on the fac- tors producing demand for illegal enter- prises (goods and services) and the factors seeking to anticipated consequences of law enforcement actions or reform, planning for functional alternatives and support for conventional actors, reducing market and demand for illicit enterprises; see Passas, 2003, for typology as one possible organ- ising conceptual framework); (cid:129) technical assistance providers and imple- menters of international standards or eval- uators of implementation and compliance progress; (cid:129) development agencies seeking to make the best use of their resources and providing effective aid; (cid:129) good governance policy makers in private and public sectors; (cid:129) operational support: knowing where the critical nodes of certain networks are is im- portant when the aim is to take out/destroy an illicit network; knowing what other re- lationships/activities will be undermined when given actors or entities are removed that knowingly or systemically bring to- gether conventional and criminal actors. Having an up-to-date view of the big pic- ture of transnational serious crime assists in developing policy and well-targeted responses. Finally, a demand-side approach to coun- ter-terrorism must supplement the supply- side, law enforcement and military ap- proaches. Terrorism is also a socio-economic and political issue refl ecting both local and global problems. Our policies must pay at- tention to new recruits and sympathisers, who could use their illegal or legal busi- nesses to facilitate fund raising and transfers \u2018for the cause\u2019. Our long-term success will be founded on long-term policies that address the fundamental problems underlying ex- tremism of all kinds. ",

        "[ 415 ] Introduction Suspicions about an illicit nuclear pro- gramme in Iran, clandestine support for North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon programme, and the discovery of the international nu- clear traffi cking ring coordinated by Abdul Qader Khan \u2014 the senior scientifi c adviser to the government of Pakistan on nuclear matters \u2014 have moved export controls up on the international political agenda and underlined that more effective export con- trols are needed around the globe. The goal of export control is twofold: to facilitate legitimate trade and to prevent illicit traf- fi cking and use of weapons and dangerous related materials. It is an essential dimension of national security and, in today's world, a global issue that transcends national sov- ereignty and policies. Today what exactly falls within a single government's \u2014 and its industry\u2019s \u2014 scope of responsibility is far from clear-cut. As the line between civil and military technology is increasingly diffi cult to police, preventing dual-use goods and technologies from reaching illegal Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programmes, military end-users in embargoed destina- tions and terrorists, has become both in- creasingly challenging and important. While there is justifi ably emphasis on the transfer of nuclear and space technologies the problem spans the full spectrum of mili- T RANSFORMING THE EU' S APPROACH TO OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE AREA OF EXPORTS CONTROLS Dr Sibylle Bauer is head of the Export Control Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Since joining SIPRI's Non-proliferation and Export Control Project in 2003, she has conducted research and implemented technical assistance programmes in the area of dual-use export controls in a number of countries, in particular South-East Europe. Prior to this, she was with the Institute for European Studies (ULB) in Brussels. She has published widely on European export control, armaments, and security issues. John Mattiussi is a career civil servant with the UK Ministry of Defence with a wide experience of security policy having worked in the EU, NATO and the USA. Between June 2003 and May 2007 he was seconded to the European Commission working on EU policy for non-proliferation and counter terrorism. This work included helping to set up the European Commission\u2019s programme for third country assistance in the area of dual-use export control. The views expressed in this article are his own. tary equipment. An arms embargo does not inhibit China from using reverse engineering techniques to amongst other things develop military vehicles incorporating European technology. With the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) identifying a persist- ent problem with the illicit traffi cking in nuclear and other radioactive material Eu- rope\u2019s security against the threat of nuclear terrorism is equally dependant on the com- petence of customs and border offi cials in regions such as the Caucasus\u2019s and Central Asia. States and companies need to accept and ensure responsibility for controls along the whole supply chain, which requires look- ing beyond the traditional focus on national territory to include consideration of many other relevant factors including licensed production, the role of multinational com- panies and subsidiaries, and cooperation with and assistance to third countries. Export control assistance emerged in the post-Cold War context of the 1990s. The United States initially focused export control assistance on the Soviet Union and its suc- cessor states, but now has a worldwide oper- ating programme (Export Control and Relat- ed Border Security Assistance \u2013 EXBS) with a budget of some US $40 million per year. As part of the process of developing an EU contribution, Member States strengthened and intensifi ed cooperation. While there was also an element of expanded contact with other states, this did not amount to an EU assistance programme, as much of it was bilateral, uncoordinated and lacking any sustained funding. Member State outreach has included participation in EXBS activi- ties and export control regime outreach, the raising of export control issues in political dialogue, and some bilateral activities in particular with accession countries. Importantly, improving other countries\u2019 export controls is not an unselfi sh act of generosity, but rather, in the security and economic interest of the EU. States cannot achieve their export control objectives by themselves since their own policies could be undermined if economic cooperation part- ners and recipients lack the legal, adminis- trative and physical capability to prevent di- version of goods to unauthorised end-users or end-uses, or to control re-exports. In the European Union this message was explicitly acknowledged in 2003, when the political context changed and a range of measures to strengthen its approach to secu- rity in general and the proliferation of WMD in particular were introduced. These includ- ed the adoption of the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass De- struction (EU WMD Strategy), which states the EU\u2019s commitment to \u2018strengthen export ",
        "[ 416 ] fi rst Pilot Project. This project had three ele- ments: fi rst, a wide ranging scoping study to investigate how Community funding under the IfS could be best used to implement the EU\u2019s WMD strategy. Papers on a range of issue areas were produced including chemi- cal weapons destruction, bio-security, nu- clear security and export control assistance. Each examined the state of play, and where and how the EU could add value through an assistance programme. Second, an inter- national conference was held in Brussels in December 2005 to discuss the fi ndings and recommendations. Third, a Field Validation Exercise intended to investigate the poten- tial for future development of Community actions was conducted during 2005-2006. It aimed to test the fi ndings for one of the issue areas, export control assistance, in one spe- cifi c region, South-East Europe. The purpose was twofold: fi rst, to help set up dual-use ex- port control systems in important neighbour- ing countries, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro; second, to test spe- cifi c approaches to export control assistance to help draw up a comprehensive EU export control assistance programme. The Field Validation Exercise focused on four areas, which were determined in co- operation with the partner countries: licens- ing, industry outreach, the role of customs in export control and investigating and pros- ecuting export control violations. In each of the three countries (four following Montene- gro\u2019s independence) a regional approach was combined with country-specifi c events. Strategy The European Security Strategy (ESS) of December 2003 identifi es the proliferation of WMD as potentially the greatest threat to Europe's Security. It notes that export con- trol has had a benefi cial effect in slowing the spread of WMD. The EU WMD Strategy sets out the detailed framework for EU action on export controls. There are three inter-linked elements, reinforcing export control in an en- larged Europe, a programme of third country assistance and strengthening export control policies in coordination with partners in the multilateral export control regimes. The development of the export control as- sistance programme has had some linkage with the other two elements referred to in the strategy. Notably the dual-use regulation is in the process of revision inter alia to better refl ect international requirements, such as UNSCR 1540. Internal EU best practice and delivering a coherent and credible message in the context of assistance programmes are clearly mutually reinforcing. To date this strong internal/external interdependence has not been systematically exploited: for fully effective assistance programme it needs to be e.g. third-country assistance has exposed in- consistencies and weaknesses in EU dual-use export controls, which need to inform and impel internal EU capacity-building. Lessons learned from the Pilot Project 2004 Identifying the challenges and limitations of EU action was an important aspect of the control policies and practices within its bor- ders and beyond, in coordination with part- ners\u2019. UN Security Council Resolution (UN- SCR) 1540 of 2004 subsequently created an obligation to put effective export controls in place and a mandate for assistance. Export control is one area where a con- tribution from the Community\u2019s fi rst pillar budget can support the implementation of the EU WMD Strategy. That is why three Pi- lot Projects, funded under a European Par- liament initiative, have focused on export controls. The fi rst (led by the Stockholm In- ternational Peace Research Institute \u2013 SIPRI) amongst other things was designed to prove the Commission\u2019s ability to deliver effective export control assistance in view of the po- tential funding for a long-term programme, the second and third (led by BAFA) were dedicated to expanding and developing this work. BAFA is also implementing a Commis- sion programme of export control assistance with the Russian Federation. The establishment of the Instrument for Stability (IfS) in 2006 with its focus on ca- pacity building, including for effective ex- port control of dual-use goods, has provided the European Commission with the fi nancial resources to support an EU assistance pro- gramme over the period 2007-2013. This paper examines the progress of the EU export control assistance programme, some of the challenges it faces and explores the potential for its future development. ",
        "[ 417 ] (cid:129) fi nally, there is a need to expand hu- man resources in the EU. This requires increasing the number of licensing and enforcement offi cers competent in du- al-use export controls to make sure a suffi cient number is available for deliv- ering assistance, and making training third countries part of the core tasks, which requires top-level recognition of the value of working with third coun- tries. The number of technical experts on the dual-use control list available for assistance missions also needs to be increased. The programme today The European Commission, working with the Member States, has progressively ex- panded the geographic scope of activity in the three Pilot Projects. Cooperation is now underway with a range of different partners covering South-East Europe (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro and Serbia), China, Morocco, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates, and further progressive expansion is planned under the IfS. These programmes focus on legal assistance, training licensing and customs offi cers, facilitating inter-agen- cy cooperation and conducting industry outreach. There was agreement early in 2007, on criteria for prioritising benefi ciary countries. Decisions on future recipient countries for export control assistance are now based on fi ve factors: tive and regulatory framework, licensing, enforcement, in particular customs, in- vestigation and prosecution and industry outreach; (cid:129) regional and country-specifi c approaches were clearly mutually reinforcing; (cid:129) the Pilot Project highlighted the impor- tance of the peer approach that has char- acterised EU engagement, and of trust, confi dence-building measures and rela- tionship building, which in turn require sustained engagement; (cid:129) the need for systemic and structured coordination and cooperation with other actors was apparent, but requires mecha- nisms and procedures to support it. Many donors are engaged in areas relevant to export controls: different EU institutions (and different sections within the institu- tions), EU Member States, the United States (in other regions, Japan and Australia), the UN, specialised international organisa- tions, international foundations. Coopera- tion with these donors is not only essential but mutually benefi cial. The same coopera- tion is also a prerequisite within the EU: between Member States, between Member States and the Commission, and between the different parts of the Commission. This involves systematic information exchange about past and future activities; (cid:129) a comprehensive database and forward- looking calendar of EU outreach and as- sistance efforts needs to be established, which would include a description of the type of activity and the institutional context; The range of activities included needs assessment visits, in-country and regional seminars and workshops, specialised semi- nars in EU Member States, study visits to EU Member States, training courses and spon- sorship of participation in related EU and third-party activities. The main conclusions of the pilot pro- gramme were as follows: (cid:129) to be credible, the EU needs to deliver a consistent and coherent message and this requires consistent and sustainable engagement, a prerequisite for which is a secure funding base; (cid:129) a successful programme needs the effec- tive combination of outreach and assist- ance to make them mutually reinforcing. Outreach can be considered as an instru- ment to persuade either states or export- ers of the need to conform to the highest international standards and ensures politi- cal buy-in from the top. Assistance helps translate the political commitment into a functioning export control system through strengthening the legal framework and technical/institutional capacity. The re- quired balance between the two depends on the stage of development of a country\u2019s export control system (i.e. is it a question of political will or capacity or both?); (cid:129) to be effective, an EU programme must be capable of assessing a country\u2019s export control system and of conducting the out- reach and delivering the specifi c type of assistance required in key areas: legisla- ",
        "[ 418 ] launching and running an export control as- sistance programme, requiring coordination within the EU institutions, amongst Member States, with other donors/international ac- tors as well as the recipient governments, a professional and sophisticated organisation is required. Unfortunately, there is no staff entirely dedicated to export control assistance in the European Commission. There will be a role for the WMD Centre in the Council Secre- tariat in helping frame policy and pursue outreach \u2014 a natural role for the Personal Representative (and the relationship with the Council Secretariat must deepen in view of the new EU treaty and the consequential institutional changes foreseen). It will be important that the programme is managed by Commission staff in coherence with other Commission activities as well as the Coun- cil. There are a range of useful Communi- ty instruments and a number of interested parties, particularly the staff in DG RELEX (External Relations), DG TRADE (responsible for the EU Dual-Use Regulation) and those responsible for customs (DG TAXUD), justice (DG JLS), enlargement (DG Enlargement) and the resources of the Commission\u2019s Joint Re- search Centre (DG JRC), particularly in the complementary areas of combating nuclear traffi cking and border monitoring that need to be coordinated to maximise the effective- ness of the programme. Additionally the Commission\u2019s delegations in recipient coun- tries can, if properly prepared, make a valu- able contribution to outreach and assistance termining factor. The existing pool appears reasonable with about 60 experts \u2018availa- ble\u2019 from 18 Member States. However, their availability is not guaranteed and access- ing the appropriate experts for assistance missions remains far from straightforward. This is currently the primary limiting fac- tor on the potential for future expansion. Developing a strategy to both expand the expert base (in particular for technical and enforcement experts) and also to access ex- pertise more effectively is clearly critical to the programme\u2019s health. One fundamental problem is the reluctance of many Member States to mainstream ex- port control assistance into their core work and the result is a lack of capacity. The Com- mission has been exploring possible ways to support increased capacity in Member States but these ideas need further development. There exists the possibility of using \u2018contrac- tors\u2019 but there are obvious diffi culties with such an approach including the potential to dilute quality. Up-to-date, hands-on knowl- edge of the issues and access to offi cial net- works are also crucial. Also important to the programme is the availability of suffi cient dedicated capac- ity in the EU institutions and in the imple- menting agent. There needs to be a high degree of continuity, given the importance of an institutional memory and of the time that goes into confi dence-building in both donor coordination and relations with the benefi ciary country. Given the complexity of 1. Relevance to the non-proliferation of WMD; 2. Relevance to the EU\u2019s foreign policy in general (e.g. as a candidate for future en- largement, in the context of the Europe- an Neighbourhood Policy, in other policy such as the Barcelona Process or through signifi cance as a trade partner, etc.); 3. The need for technical assistance; 4. Willingness to accept assistance and to cooperate on non-proliferation; 5. Existence of an EU comparative advan- tage over other donors. There remains however the risk that the EU will make political commitments on export control assistance that it will not be able to satisfy expeditiously. A list of priorities for the implementation of the WMD Strategy presented by the Offi ce of the Personal Rep- resentative of the EU High Representative for the non-proliferation of WMD and endorsed by the GAERC (General Affairs and Exter- nal Relations Council) in December 2006, identifi ed a number of potential candidate countries for EU export control co-opera- tion, highlighting the 71 Africa, Caribbean and Pacifi c (ACP) states, Albania, India, Pa- kistan and, additionally, Belarus, Moldova, Macedonia (FYROM), Kenya, Malaysia and Morocco. Albania, Macedonia (FYROM) and Morocco were subsequently introduced into the programme in 2007 but there are limits to what the programme can take on. Member States\u2019 provision of licensing and enforcement experts is the crucial de- ",
        "[ 419 ] countries receiving assistance is equally im- portant. Since quantitative indicators such as the number of events or participants are not adequate measures of performance, a set of process-based qualitative indicators needs to be developed, such as the function/role of participants in developing/strengthening a country\u2019s export control system. These will need to be adapted to the situation in the benefi ciary country and factor in questions such as what external assistance can real- istically achieve, and which obstacles need to be addressed internally. Future challenges The requirement for dual-use export control assistance is compelling. What re- mains to be decided is the scope and com- prehensiveness of the EU response. The ini- tial structure put together by the European Commission is fi t for its purpose, subject to Member States continued support, and a sound basis on which to build. It is like- ly that further success will be rewarded with contracts for export control assist- ance covering the whole of the IfS fund- ing period. It is clear from the experience to date and the model provided by the US EXBS programme that the full potential of this activity is considerable. Strength- ening the enforcement components and complementing export control assistance with other anti-traffi cking measures such as border control obviously makes sense. The full potential of tools to combat illicit traffi cking should be explored in which a variety of actors need to be involved, China has gone well, whereas the activity with Ukraine commenced slowly and coop- eration with UAE has had diffi culties getting started. Many of these problems appear to be related to factors beyond the control of those running the programme, and indicate that the programme has to factor in a preparatory phase for study and analysis to prepare the ground for more substantive work. More work needs to done on what facili- tates good, timely cooperation. Based on initial observations the following factors appear important: a technical rather than political focus (the political framework is important but it really needs to be in place before the real cooperation on the ground can begin); investing equally in laws, in- stitutions and people and engaging with the benefi ciary country over the full range of potential institutional partners (all those involved with the export control process, from laws and licensing through to enforce- ment as well as industry). It is also crucial to connect, at an early stage, with the other active donors and programmes in related areas to exchange information, in particu- lar to identify cooperation partners, con- duct an analysis of key actors, share needs assessments and avoid any duplication of effort. Reciprocal participation in events is also helpful. Given the developing nature of the pro- gramme regular evaluation and feedback are necessary to fi ne tune project activities. A means of assessing the progress of the on the ground. It is diffi cult to envisage any of this being done optimally without dedi- cated staff working in support of policy. The implementing agent has a vital role. It manages the day-to-day work and must put together the appropriate package of assist- ance and recruit the Member State experts for the target country or region in question. The fi rst Commission Pilot Project was im- plemented by a small team from SIPRI. The remaining projects are being implemented by Germany\u2019s Federal Offi ce of Econom- ics and Export Control (BAFA), with SIPRI\u2019s support. BAFA has the right credentials for the role, being the largest export control or- ganisation in Europe. It is a growing player in EU outreach and invests in the neces- sary infrastructure. They were the only or- ganisation interested in implementing the long-term programme and consequently are in line to receive the fi rst export control assistance contract under the IfS. To date they have done well developing their or- ganisation to accommodate an expanding programme. While it is too early to make conclusive judgements on progress with benefi ciary states some trends are apparent. It is diffi - cult to compare the individual country pro- grammes as they are each tailored to the specifi c country requirement and range from the creation of an export control system to targeting specifi c needs. That said, work in South-Eastern Europe has progressed smoothly; the cooperation with Russia and ",

These tools would support and complement ongoing export control assistance programmes. Working more closely with other important inter- national players, such as IAEA, OPCW (Or- ganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) and WCO (World Customs Or- ganisation), should be pursued. Achiev- ing the programme\u2019s maximum potential through strengthened internal and external coherence should be the objective. Member States\u2019 full involvement will be essential for both programme development and suc- cessful implementation. ",
        "[ 421 ] Introduction Proliferation networks operate like com- panies. 1 They must be capable of coordinat- ing a series of elementary logistics, fi nancial and technical functions. Due to the increase in worldwide exchanges, the reinforcement of existing export control tools alone will not be suffi cient to face the increase in proliferation fl ows. Despite wide- spread reporting in the media, interdiction operations 2 also can only have limited effect on networks, due to their occasional nature, if they are undertaken independently of an approach targeting other functions. It also seems hardly realistic to wish to neutralise a proliferation network only by freezing part of its credits in the framework of a repres- sive approach. 3 Setting up an overall policy provides a means of coordinating intelligence actions, repression tools and interdiction means both nationally and internationally, and therefore appears as the only viable solution in the struggle against proliferation networks. F OR A CONSISTENT POLICY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST PROLIFERATION NETWORKS Guillaume Schlumberger has been the Executive Director of Fondation pour la Recherche Strat\u00e9gique (FRS) since June 2005. Until that date, he was deputy to the Director of the Policy Branch of the MoD (D\u00e9l\u00e9gation aux Affaires Strat\u00e9giques \u2013 DAS). After graduating from Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration, he was posted to the MoD as a civil servant in 1985. There he served in several senior positions, in the International Affairs Directorate of the Procurement Branch (DGA) from 1985 to 1997, and in the Policy Branch (DAS) from 1998 to 2005. Bruno Gruselle has been a research fellow at FRS since September 2005, where he follows issues related to missile proliferation, counter- proliferation and missile defence. He served in the MoD from 1995 to 2005, where he was sent to Iraq several times as an international inspector (UNSCOM). He graduated from Engineering School in 1995 and received a Master Degree from the University of Poitiers in Detonics. In 2003, he became head of the Industrial Security Branch of the Export Control Bureau of the MoD before joining FRS. This is a complex task, for it requires the organisation of inter-ministerial (or inter- agency) responsibilities, and in particular it requires an equilibrium between long-term and short-term actions. Finally, it depends on the reinforcement of links between the administrations involved and private par- ticipants including service companies, fi - nancial institutions and enterprises. Intelligence, a central tool in the struggle against networks The first step in an efficient struggle against proliferation networks is to carry out a mapping operation (network structure and operating modes). This requires intelligence capability in the various fi elds in which the networks are involved. The network \u2018mapping\u2019 work depends fi rst on monitoring of fl ows, individuals and companies so as to detect proliferat- ing activities. For example, monitoring of an identifi ed intermediary in the Khan net- work provides a means of fi nding supplier companies, intermediary banks and possi- bly other agents belonging to the network. 4 Two traps must be avoided in this approach; the temptation to stop an operation before the network has been fully established can be very strong. It has the risk, however, of a major reorganisation and by the disap- pearance of participants who could have been observed to identify a key node. 5 On the other hand, failing to act before the network has been fully established can allow transactions to be completed with dra- matic consequences in terms of dissemina- tion of technologies. Therefore, an equilibrium has to be found between the need to obtain the most com- plete and detailed map possible and con- straints to take action against a particular transaction or against a participant consid- ered to be suffi ciently important so that his or her neutrality will affect network activi- ties in the long term. 6 In terms of the national intelligence or- ganisation, the three large Western coun- tries (the United States, United Kingdom and 1 B. Gruselle and G. Schlumberger. \u2018Proliferation networks: between sopranos and supermarkets\u2019, FRS notes, July 2006. 2 The interdiction consists of blocking ongoing transfers and operations. It may be done within a legal framework (seizure in customs, freeze account, sanctions) or militarily (interception of cargo at sea). 3 Repression is intended to neutralise the activity of network agents or to prevent the completion of operations undertaken by them. For example, the objective may be to prevent access of the network to intermediate banks, to stop an intermediary or a priori to prevent the export of goods or transfer of technologies organised for the benefi t of the network or one of its clients. 4 http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1140/urs-tinner 5 The notes for the \u2018Terrorism Financing and State Responses in Comparative Perspective\u2019 conference, Centre for Contemporary Confl ict, 4-5 November 2005, are particularly interesting in this question. 6 The example of the dismantlement of the Khan network is based on this equilibrium logic, US intelligence services probably having delayed action against the network so as to be able to act at the greatest possible depth.

Control of end users: point d) in article 3 applies essentially to control of transit and transfers, but it also obliges states to set up means of controlling the nature of the end user. 3. Control of services and funds: related to export operations; this particular point also obliges states to check \u2018the supply of funds or services \u2014 for example fi - nancing or transport \u2014 related to export or transfer operations that contribute to proliferation\u2019. However, it is regrettable that in terms of checking the service industry (transport, freighting, banks), Resolution 1540 only rec- ommends monitoring of activities related to exports stricto sensu. Furthermore, as a fi rst reading, it is limited to criminalising the proliferation of unconventional weapons carried out by non-state players. 11 Conse- quently, and even if the text is intention- ally ambiguous concerning proliferation of WMD by states, its extension to this case would appear politically improbable; some In order to improve the effi ciency of the intelligence function, it appears necessary to improve dialogue between services and small sensitive companies . These are an at- tractive target particularly for networks, due to their economic vulnerability. The fi rst step would consist of drawing up an exhaustive list of companies that might be concerned, and keeping it up to date. It would then be necessary to defi ne the nature of exchanges between companies and intelligence servic- es. For example, the US Treasury Department performs an information mission before fi - nancial institutions in addition to advertis- ing actions about cases for which repressive measures have been taken. Similarly, the TRACFIN unit receives declarations of sus- picions but also in principle sends feedback to the declarer. 10 How to neutralise networks? Towards setting legal bases Since Resolution 1540 was adopted by the UN Security Council in April 2004, efforts in the struggle against proliferation networks are backed up by a formal framework that fi xes key measures to be taken by members of the organisation in terms of: 1. Interdiction of illegal intermediation activities for weapons, vectors and related France) have relatively similar tools \u2014 an in- ternal security service and one or several or- ganisations dedicated to intelligence abroad. This complete assembly can monitor activi- ties of any networks on its own territory and their ramifi cations outside. Furthermore, financially the United States has created a structure that is dis- tinctive in that it includes intelligence tools and means of taking action against net- works, including international networks. 7 The Offi ce of Terrorism and Financial In- telligence (OTFI) was created within the Treasury Department in 2004, and it has legal powers that enable the US govern- ment to target banks acting on behalf of networks, 8 and specifi c tools designed to monitor international fi nancial fl ows. In particular, this \u2018arsenal\u2019 9 appears to include obtaining targeted data originating from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Finan- cial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Finally, the functional concentration achieved within the Treasury department for fi nancial security activities, enables the OTFI to obtain assistance from all services that might be concerned, including those originating from intelligence or fi nancial repression activities. 7 \u2018Prepared Remarks by Stuart Levey, Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence before the American Enterprise Institute\u2019, 8 September 2006. 8 This applies to Executive Order 13382, 28 June 2005, \u2018Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and their Supporters\u2019, enables the departments of Justice, the Treasury and the State Department to prevent any transaction between the United States and persons or companies participating in proliferation activities.

On the other hand, the crea- tion and updating of lists of dual-use goods can prove diffi cult considering constant changes of technologies. 15 For a country with limited administrative resources, 16 the volume of work involved in the manage- ment of export or transit applications (in- cluding transport documents) 17 for dual-use goods may become such that it introduces dysfunctions in their processing: delays, su- perfi cial analyses, errors, etc. Similarly, ill- informed or uninformed companies tend to submit incomplete or misleading demands to export control administrations. However, a number of improvements could be considered: (cid:129) setting up of \u2018catch-all\u2019 clauses. The pur- pose is not to make a judgement about the intrinsic sensitivity of a product, but rather the intrinsic sensitivity of the end user and the possible use he might make of it. 18 \u2018Catch-all\u2019 clauses also oblige ex- porters to inform control authorities about any suspicions they have about the end- use of the goods or the nature of the end user, thus contributing to making compa- nies more responsible 19 (like the control over fi nancial fl ows); Teheran\u2019s nuclear programme, targeting activities of institutions and intermediar- ies acting for the acquisition network. By setting up a committee responsible for its application, it opens up the possibility of modifying this list that takes account of the network's fi nancial activities. Widening the action fi eld against proliferation networks Economic globalisation makes it neces- sary to coordinate policies of states creating technologies and countries sheltering service activities 14 that could be used by organisa- tions involved in the trade of weapons of mass destruction. Progress has undoubtedly been made since 2003 following the launch of the Container Security Initiative and the Proliferation Security Initiative in terms of cooperation on fl ow control. In particular, they have made it possible to set up systems for checking exports or goods in transit in some states that acted as relays for network activities. But genuine problems arise with the creation and the use by states of lists of goods and technologies for which export and transit are generally subject to prior authorisations. Complete systems and their main components are usually relatively countries legally pursue their activities for the development of nuclear weapons and a fortiori missiles. Resolution 1718, 14 October 2006, 12 voted following the North Korean test on 9 Octo- ber 2006, could become a reference in the struggle against proliferation networks to the extent that it is complementary to pro- visions of Resolution 1540. Apart from giv- ing UN members the right to freeze North Korean assets abroad, article 8.d states that states must prevent their nationals and per- sons operating within their frontiers from providing fi nancial assistance to any person or entity involved in North Korean missile or nuclear programmes. Article 8.f also de- crees that all cargo entering or leaving the territory shall be searched. Application of this resolution, apart from its utility as an example for future or existing proliferation affairs, could help to improve methods used by some service companies who support op- eration of networks and possibly reinforce the dialogue between the private sector and services and agencies responsible for the struggle against proliferation. Similarly, Security Council Resolution 1737 imposing targeted sanctions on Iran 13 applies measures of the same nature to 12 Voted under chapter VII. 13 http://www.mideastweb.org/1737.htm 14 Financing, transport/freight, transfer, intermediation. 15 All that is necessary to be convinced of this is to look at the lists of goods produced by the Wassenaar arrangement. 16 Precisely those for which vigilance is particularly desirable in terms of control to the extent that they are the main targets of networks. 17 Cargo manifests in particular. 18 Irina Albrecht, \u2018Catch-all controls\u2019, paper prepared for the International Control Conference, London, 2004. 19 Ibid.

Building a consistent inter-ministerial and international structure The question of overall consistency must inevitably arise as new tools of different natures are added to the range of means designed to struggle against proliferation networks. The struggle against proliferation networks cannot depend on a logic of isolat- ed and independent operations, it must form part of a coordinated international approach targeting all network functions. There is no doubt that there is no organi- sation or forum that has the task of precisely coordinating interception actions, possible fi - nancial operations and intelligence. The PSI provides an attractive framework for the crea- tion of such an organisation, because it already coordinates interception activities. However, its operational and informal nature does not make it suitable for such a function. There- fore, it could be more useful to consider crea- tion of an organisation that would have the role of managing the use of all available tools to neutralise a specifi c network that would involved in laundering activities and freez- ing their credits. Furthermore, the FATF pro- poses several ways of reinforcing the role of fi nancing institutions in their struggle against laundering and fi nancing of ter- rorism that could be interesting in terms of fi nancing of proliferation. Have legal tools to supervise the intermediary business The generalisation of provisions aimed at supervising the activities of brokers is be- coming urgent. Intermediaries play an im- portant role in the operation of networks by acting as the main relays for acquisition attempts in other countries. 22 Apart from the United States, which introduced provi- sions in 1996 related to brokers in the law on control of weapon exports, 23 few coun- tries have any legal instruments that they can use against brokers. 24 However, there are some countries including France that have set up such tools. The European Union Council adopted a common position in 2003 on the control of armament intermediaries. 25 In both cases, the objective is to: (cid:129) list brokers operating on the territory con- cerned. It is sometimes envisaged to set up an activity authorisation system, as a better means of controlling operators; (cid:129) the possibility of producing lists of suspect fi nal destinations must be considered and generalised. Such documents, despite the political diffi culties that may surround their creation, have a genuine use in the context of the struggle against prolifera- tion networks, provided that prior intel- ligence work has made it possible to map their structure. This is particularly true because production of this type of docu- ment may be envisaged within multina- tional groups, 20 so as to better coordinate efforts made by a group of countries; (cid:129) reinforcement of the required precision for transport documents should be en- visaged to prevent suspect and unusable declarations. Struggle against fi nancing of networks Even if its action is now concentrated on money laundering and fi nancing of terror- ism, the adoption of Resolution 1540 pro- vides a basis for extending the scope of the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 21 to include the struggle against fi - nancing of proliferation. FATF recommendations apply essentially to the need for states to have a legal frame- work for tracking persons and legal entities 20 For example, for supplier groups: MTCR, NSG. 21 The FATF was created in 1989 by the G 7, and now includes 33 member countries, this core being extended by observer countries and the existence of regional forums \u2014 for example an Asia-Pacifi c group to which China belongs \u2014 and the participation of international agencies or organisations. 22 B.

        "[ 429 ] Afghanistan \u2014 the time of the Hazaras This land is indeed far away from where the little GIs are getting lost in the sand waging their \u2018war on terrorism\u2019, just like the soldiers of Britain\u2019s Glorious Majesty did before them in the days of Kipling\u2019s \u2018Big Game\u2019. Far away in space and in time. Afghanistan is a country of borders, at the crossroads of several worlds, and a place where more than one invader has lost his way. The Hazaras we see in these images are themselves descendants of one of the nomadic peo- ples absorbed into Afghanistan. A little different from the other Afghans: Tajiks, Uzbeks and Pashtuns, who come from Central Asia. As for their religion, they look towards Persia: they are Shia Muslims. They came in the wake of Genghis Khan\u2019s hordes and settled in villages of fortifi ed farms, where the high mountains impose their law and where every drop of water and every fruit that grows matters. The trip across the mountains is an ordeal in space and in time: your breath gets shorter and your steps more sluggish, the slopes are dangerous. When the fi rst rains come, the sand saturates and holds back the traveller\u2019s car; it wears out both horses and men. You must not hurry. Afghanistan is still a stranger to speed. You can not impose your will on the moun- tain just like that. In this country, blighted by 30 years of war, every scar on the ground, on the walls and on peoples\u2019 faces are traces of an era: nomadic invasions, empires that came and fell and civil wars. Afghanistan still lives in an age of strongholds, warlords and soldiers of fortune. The Hazaras know this well; they have often been victims of civil wars and Pashtun invasions. Seen as \u2018heretics\u2019 for their Shia faith, they are despised by other Afghans, who are Sunnis. Very devout, they seem close to a \u2018quietist\u2019 philosophy of Shia Islam: their life belongs to God and religion does not mix with politics \u2026 One day the Mahdi will return to impose a righteous order on earth. This life of today is ephemeral and paradise awaits the good and the meek. In Kabul, where they live in the grubby suburbs, the rhythm is no longer the same as in the mountains. Time accelerates: we are much more in the present. From year to year the city expands in the most anarchic way. Down there the Hazaras are the \u2018small hands\u2019 of the city: porters, water-carriers, workmen, vendors\u2026 They make their livelihoods in the dust of the roads and the brick kilns. Some still prefer to escape the country to Iran or to the small Ha- zara community in Quetta, Pakistan. The Hazaras are trapped in time \u2014 between the secular past as a community attached to the mountains and the present day globalised war, which is catching up on them, before the fall of the next empire...

These people are not willing to give up and want a better future. So globally are things getting better or worse? On the development agenda, things have been making steady progress after three dec- ades of warfare. The Afghan government started from scratch and it remains weak, but it has set up village councils in the last years and on other parts of the development agenda we are defi nitely on track. However, to continue \u2014 Afghanistan\u2019s people have a right to development and participation in political life. How would you rate the European Un- ion\u2019s early warning and early response mechanisms? What lessons in early warn- ing have been learned in recent years in Afghanistan? In Afghanistan we are already making use of a fi nancial instrument that responds to the EU\u2019s strengthened capacity in early warning and early response mechanisms \u2014 the launching phase of the EC justice reform programme is fi nanced from the Stability In- strument. Essentially, it allowed us to quickly react to a need identifi ed in 2006. The EU was challenged to make a substantial con- tribution to improving the rule of law in Afghanistan. With the ESDP mission and the EU justice programme, implemented in close synergy, we will make a coherent con- tribution to improving the rule of law sec- tor. Having a new fi nancial instrument, that allows us to react to such challenges made such a timely intervention possible. You have recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan. What were your impressions? My impression is slightly more optimistic than what you\u2019re likely to read in the news. On the ground lots of things are actually happening. Progress in social development and even economic growth has been remark- What relevancy does Afghanistan have for the European Union? With the United States\u2019 active engagement in the country, does Afghanistan need to be high up on the EU\u2019s agenda? Afghanistan has direct relevance for the European as it does for the US \u2014 in today\u2019s world all countries are interconnected. As opposed to previous times we can no longer afford to \u201cforget\u201d countries, leaving them behind to become failed states. Sooner or later they will \u201cremind\u201d us of their exist- ence: by sending streams of destitute refu- gees across their borders destabilising neigh- bouring countries with a domino effect on the wider region, by sending drugs even to other continents because the domestic rule of law is weak. So, these are just some of the reasons why even a country so far away from the US and Europe matters to us in a very immediate manner. Let me add to this one more aspect: the last few years have brought unprece- dented economic growth to many parts of our planet, life expectancy keeps on increas- ing and there is, albeit slowly, progress in reaching the Millenium Development Goals. So, then tell me how can we reconcile with leaving one country out of this equation? Afghanistan continues to be at the very low end of UN lists classifying countries accord- ing to progress made in human develop- ment, making reference to very basic pa- rameters.

For that reason, our police-training mission and jus- tice reform mission are very closely related to each other, because Afghans have to see that their state delivers justice, is equitable and ensures human rights are upheld. Ultimately though, would you agree that there has to be a military solution in Af- ghanistan \u2014 that without the defeat of the Taliban, development cannot take place? It has to be a parallel process. Our part- ners on the ground have no choice but to advance the development agenda while, quite possibly, something very bad is hap- pening in the next village. Over the years we have lost a number of health workers who were bringing better health, survival and quality of life to their Afghan com- patriots. Tremendously tragic as it is, this hasn\u2019t stopped us from pursuing our devel- opment programme. In Afghanistan you don\u2019t fi nd any virgin green fi eld in which you can start building- up villages. This is simply unrealistic. We have to show the Afghan people that now they can improve their lives and get their products to the market and send their kids to school. If we didn\u2019t continue with our development efforts in a very hard-nosed way, there would be no alternative to turn to in the face of the onslaught of the insur- gents\u2019 attacks. We have seen unspeakably horrid suicide attacks but people doggedly continue going about their business. the growing of poppy, we\u2019ve seen quite a lot of progress in the last years. But this is being endangered by the insurgency. How can the EU, a non-military organi- sation, help bring more security to the Af- ghan people? We are, of course, not involved with the Afghan Army. That is not our role and others do that. But we are very strongly involved in other aspects of the security agenda. We\u2019ve been instrumental in fund- ing the salaries of the police through the law and order trust fund \u2014 to the tune of \u20ac 135 million in 2002-2006 \u2014 which is also a vehicle for police reform. We are also focusing on justice reform because initial steps in this area addressed legal issues, not institutional ones, and we believe a lot needs to be done to make the Afghan judiciary more professional. For that reason, we have deployed a short-term justice mission under the Stability Instru- ment to reform the justice sector. This con- sists of sending experts who are embedded within the three key justice institutions \u2014 the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and Attorney General\u2019s offi ce. By the mid- dle of next year we hope to have a fairly comprehensive plan for the reform of all the justice institutions that would be the basis for a reform programme that we aim to fund. Everyone agrees that progress in Afghan- istan hinges on progress in the rule of law, \u2014 which is why we place such emphasis on our rule of law mission in the country. Se- we are lagging behind in other areas \u2014 like rural development, justice and security \u2014 where it took longer for donors and the government to agree a common vision. Is the main problem the deteriorating security situation in large swathes of the country? One thing that helped us over the fi rst few years was the relatively benign security situation. The insurgency we now see in the south makes any development a major challenge, if not almost impossible. Very closely linked to the security situation is the drugs problem. The latest report from the United Nations Offi ce on Drugs and Crime shows a clear link between the insurgency, criminal networks and drugs. In some places development is not only stagnating but is being rolled back. We have experienced some nasty surprises, like in the province of Nangahar, where the progress that was made was negative. There is renewed planting of opium poppy and now this province that was relatively stable is again being affected by the in- surgency. It is diffi cult for development to move ahead without security. Can the EU do anything about the drugs epidemic? We\u2019re already doing something that\u2019s very comprehensive, but not all over the country.

If you look at fe- male health or education, if you want to bring services to remote, conservative com- munities, you will need local females to do this \u2014 and it takes time to train them. You will also need to convince their families of the need to do this and make it socially ac- ceptable for them to leave their villages to study. So, there is an issue with absorptive capacity which we have to bear in mind. So in summary, are you optimistic that things will get better in Afghanistan? Things must get better because in the globalised world we can\u2019t allow a country to slip back and fall prey to systems and ideologies that restrict individuals in their social and economical development and take away their human and social rights. The international community has a duty to stand by the Afghans by showing that there is an alternative \u2014 even if progress takes longer than people expected. border posts to provide security and ensure the smooth functioning of trade and have similar programmes now on the border with Central Asia. The international community is do- ing a lot for Afghanistan, but is it doing enough? The fi nancial needs of Afghanistan will remain very important, not just in terms of building infrastructure, but also in helping the central government stand on its feet, because it is not yet strong enough to do so on its own. Over many years to come the EU will need to continue contributing to trust funds which are essential to help ensure the functioning of the Afghan state to help steady it. Having said this, a lot of people say the answer to Afghanistan\u2019s problems lies in increasing fi nancial assistance. But there are some things that you cannot buy with more money, and which will not go any Does this emphasis on development differ from the EU\u2019s partners? Not judging from the evidence in the fi eld. All those who are militarily engaged are also very heavily engaged in develop- ment. Our American partners are in fi rst place when it comes to civilian reconstruc- tion \u2014 they have set aside some \u20ac 2 billion over two years \u2014 and also paying the sala- ries of Afghan soldiers. So these are enor- mous amounts and we mustn\u2019t forget the Americans are particularly bent on cum- bersome and dangerous tasks like build- ing roads, dams and other essential infra- structure. They have undertaken to build the entire ring road around Afghanistan, and I say this with some emphasis because there are still some provinces that don\u2019t even have a centimetre of tarmac. Without better roads you cannot enable people to pursue alternative economic development, which is why we have funded the road from Kabul to Pakistan. We have upgraded the ",

        "[ 449 ] The picture for Africa was mixed. There has been a big fall in the number of state- based confl icts in Africa over the last 15 years \u2014 a reduction by half \u2014 but Africa is still home to most of the world\u2019s confl icts. The report found that in 2003 Africa was home to 46 of 89 cases of armed confl ict and one-sided violence that year, and that of the 29 countries experiencing such vio- lence, 13 of them were in Africa. Combine this with two statistics from the Oxford academic Paul Collier \u2014 that almost half the countries coming out of civil war fall back into confl ict within fi ve years, and the average civil war costs a country and its neighbours around US $54 billion dol- lars in direct costs and lost growth \u2014 and you have a pretty stark demonstration of the confl ict trap in Africa. The challenge of early warning and early response The title of this article describes an ideal \u2014 i.e. a community of nations with sys- tems in place to alert them to the risk of looming confl ict, and a willingness and ability to intervene to prevent full scale confl ict from breaking out.

And it\u2019s not as though the Congo doesn\u2019t have enough problems of its own, with some 40,000 peo- ple dying each month from confl ict related disease and malnutrition. 2 So, that\u2019s the news \u2014 and without some context, you could be forgiven for thinking that Africa is beyond assistance, destined forever to be wracked by confl ict. But is that really the case? A future for Africa? Some of the answers can be found in an excellent report published in 2005 \u2014 the Human Security Report \u2014 put together by Andy Mack and his team at the Human Security Centre in Canada, and funded by the Norwegian Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among others. For the fi rst time it pulled together a whole range of statis- tics on confl icts around the world, with much of the data coming from the Interna- tional Peace Research Institute in Oslo and Uppsala University. The report\u2019s headline is an encouraging one, and perhaps counterintuitive; namely that there has been a 40 per cent reduction in the number of armed confl icts since the early 1990s.

Introduction Developed countries donate a large amount of money for development to un- der-developed countries around the world. Take Norway, as an example, which is one of the world\u2019s most generous donors, donating 0.95 per cent of its GDP to developing coun- tries, most of them in Africa. Yet the tragedy of Africa is that, despite the attention Nor- way and the rest of the developed world has paid to the region over the decades and the billions of euros in aid that have been chan- nelled there, we seem little closer to remov- ing the scourge of confl ict that continues to devastate much of the continent. You just have to look at the news head- lines any day of the week and there will be yet another story of some civil war or coup in Africa. The devastating situation in Darfur continues to get even worse \u2014 hard though that it is to believe. Daily clashes are being reported in the oil rich delta region of Nigeria. Weeks of fi ghting in Somalia\u2019s capital, Mogadishu, claimed over 100 lives. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is in the middle of a 4-year civil war. Ethiopia and Eritrea are contem- plating going to war with each other again.

        "[ 450 ] and half the population of Norway (4.6 mil- lion) had been driven from their homes. What makes this all the more tragic is that policy-makers and leaders around the world know exactly what is happening there. They cannot plead ignorance. There was no lack of warning about what is going on as it unfolded. Thanks to the work of Crisis Group, Hu- man Rights Watch and others such as Nick Kristof of The New York Times and Juan Mendez, the UN\u2019s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, these atrocities are all too well documented. Yet, despite all the evidence, the international community has utterly failed in its responsibility to protect the people of Darfur. So what action has the international community taken? In the case of Darfur, the UN Security Council has been appallingly slow to put any real pressure on the Sudanese gov- ernment. It was some two years after the confl ict started, and in the face of repeated provocations from the Sudanese government \u2014 including its utter failure to disarm the Janjaweed \u2014 that the Security Council belat- edly decided to impose sanctions against the Sudanese government (Resolution 1591, 29 March 2005). However, it was still arguing over which individuals are to be subject to those sanctions \u2014 some three years after the confl ict started, and a year after the resolu- tion was passed. of a small body (EISAS \u2014 Information and Strategic Analysis Secretariat) to collect and analyse information on possible confl icts, but member states blocked it. So why is there such an aversion to the creation of effective mechanisms to track and warn about confl ict? Leaving aside bureau- cratic inertia, there are two main reasons. The fi rst is that many Northern states prefer to keep the UN in a position of dependence on their resources, and hence more effectively control its actions. The second is that many Southern states fear that early warning will lead to early intervention, thus trampling on their sovereignty. So, the result is that the UN Secretariat has to rely on other sources for its early warning \u2014 its missions, contri- butions by member states, and NGOs such as Crisis Group. However, even when it has all the information necessary to enable it to act, it and the international community it repre- sents usually fail to act in time to prevent confl ict from spiralling out of control. International response to Darfur What we have seen in Darfur since early 2003 is slow motion ethnic cleansing tak- ing place before the world\u2019s eyes. More than 200,000 have died in the confl ict, most from confl ict-related disease and malnutrition. More than two million have been forced from their homes, and over 200,000 Su- danese are refugees in neighbouring Chad. To put these awful fi gures into perspective, that is as though half the population of Oslo (540,000) had died because of the confl ict, Why do we fi nd it so hard to intervene to prevent confl icts? There is no shortage of early warnings out there for those that want to be informed. There is a shortage perhaps of early warning systems \u2014 systems that rig- orously and systematically track indicators that correlate to increased risk of confl ict \u2014 but not of early warning itself. You just have to go to the website of the International Crisis Group to fi nd a huge amount of early warning material. The real problem is one of political will. Early warning rarely leads to effective and timely response. And one of the reasons for this is that early warning is largely a technical exercise, while early re- sponse is a political exercise. There needs to be political will to intervene, but all too often the will is just not there. The political obstacles to early action are on full display at the United Nations. The UN Secretariat still does not have a func- tioning early warning system for confl icts. This has been a longstanding problem at the UN. Thorvald Stoltenberg, who used to be an UN Mediator for the Balkans in the mid-90s, told me about when he was work- ing with David Owen, the EU Representative, and French and German colleagues. Each of these colleagues would receive morning intelligence reports and analysis from their countries\u2019 agencies \u2014 and he received noth- ing from the UN \u2014 not even a collation of open source information with some minimal analysis. This is clearly an untenable situ- ation if the UN is to play an informed role. The Brahimi report recommended creation ",
        "[ 451 ] ministration did everything it could to avoid calling events in Rwanda a \u2018genocide\u2019 \u2014 using all sorts of word play to avoid mak- ing that judgement, fearing that if it did it would have to take far stronger action that it was prepared to. This time around there has been little hesitation in calling the situation a genocide, in the light of far more ambivalent evidence \u2014 with the apparent conclusion that doing so did not impose any commensurate obligation to act. The Regional Impact All confl icts in Africa have impacts be- yond the borders of the country suffering from the confl ict. We have seen that most starkly in Chad where the government was nearly overthrown in March 2006 by rebels who advanced to the outskirts of the capital N\u2019djamena, and were only just turned back \u2014 but they have by no means been defeated. This was simply the latest phase in a re- gional confl ict in which the actors are the Chadian and Sudanese governments, and the Chadian and Sudanese armed groups operating in the Darfur region. There are two main rebel alliances and a plethora of smaller armed groups now fi ghting in Chad. One recruits predominantly among the Tama tribal group and is directly spon- sored by the Sudanese government (the Front for Unity and Change (FUC), and its core group the Rally for Democracy and Liberty (RDL)). The other is led by defectors from the Chad army (The rally of Demo- cratic Forces (RaFD-SCUD dissolved itself European Union was largely to support the work of the African Union. The EU made it clear that it saw the AU as the lead interna- tional player in Darfur, and that the EU\u2019s role was primarily to support African solutions to African problems, by funding the AU mis- sion. NATO has been a strategic competitor of the EU in Darfur and has been providing expertise and logistical support to the AU mission. However, NATO currently has no intention of going beyond its limited support and logistical role and actually putting troops on the ground in any signifi cant numbers. Then there is the United States, which has a mixed record on Darfur. In its rhetoric, the US has been at the forefront of international action. Both Colin Powell and George Bush called events in Darfur a \u2018genocide\u2019. In addi- tion, both Powell and Condoleezza Rice have been to Darfur. The US has been generous in its aid contributions, supplying well over half the food supplies to the displaced Darfurians. And in perhaps its most signifi cant move, the US abstained from the Security Council vote on the ICC referral, allowing the referral to go through \u2014 a very signifi cant step for an administration that had made opposition to the ICC a leading plank of its foreign policy until then. Nevertheless, while the US has called events in Darfur a \u2018genocide\u2019, and has yet to put real pressure on the Sudanese regime, there is a tragic irony about the US response to Darfur when compared with its response to Rwanda some 12 years ago. Then, the ad- The Security Council did take more ro- bust action on the legal front, after much lobbying from Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch and others. In March 2005, it referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation. The ICC opened its investigation into Darfur and is now actively investigating crimes in the region \u2014 despite much obstruction from the Sudanese government. The other key international actor on Darfur has been the African Union. Darfur has been a test case for the fl edgling organisation. It has done as much as could be expected with its limited resources and mandate, but now its limitations are being exposed. The Afri- can Union established a small monitoring mission in Darfur mid-2004, consisting of some 60 monitors and 300 troops to protect them. Over the following couple of years, the mission gradually expanded to some 7,700 troops and monitors. However, we have seen a large gap between intentions and capabili- ties. Those 7,700 were expected to patrol an area almost double the size of Norway. An- other critical limitation of the AU mission was its mandate. It was largely an observer mission. It did not have a mandate to go out and proactively protect civilians. In fact, it could only protect civilians when they are being attacked before its eyes, and only then, if it felt it had enough forces to intervene. That leaves the European Union, NATO and the United States as the remaining key international actors. The approach of the ",
        "[ 452 ] in civil confl icts, fearing it may lead one day to intervention in Chechnya or Tibet or Xinjiang. The Arab League, and most of its member states, is utterly opposed to a Western-led intervention in North Africa, and strongly protective of one of their own. Moreover, the AU is operating in Darfur with the consent of the government of Sudan, and is reluc- tant to push too hard for fear of being fur- ther marginalised. It also desperately wants to prove that it can resolve one of Africa\u2019s most destructive confl icts, even when all the evidence now is that it cannot. And in Chad, the international commu- nity has not put any real pressure on the government to resolve the issues that are driving much of the confl ict there \u2014 issues such as a lack of democratic avenues for political grievances to be resolved; human rights abuses; corruption; and the utter lack of development despite increasing oil wealth. The approach here is very much one of deal- ing with the devil they know. These motivations all combine to ensure that the international community shies away from effective intervention. Instead, it fo- cuses its efforts on providing humanitarian assistance \u2014 thereby addressing the conse- quences, but not the causes. Responsibility to protect So how should the world be responding? Simply put, the international community cost for the international community, the situation would become more intractable with each passing day, causing large scale displacement and ethnically driven purg- es, and requiring intervention at a much greater cost. Why hasn\u2019t the world acted? So why hasn\u2019t the international communi- ty done more to prevent the atrocities in Dar- fur, or to stop Chad spiralling into confl ict? The very sad reality is that Darfur just does not matter enough, and Sudan matters too much, for the international community to do more. Much as governments in Europe and the US are disturbed by what is happening in Darfur \u2014 and they genuinely are \u2014 almost without exception they are not prepared to commit their troops on the ground in Su- dan. Hence, their enthusiastic support for African solutions to African problems. The situation is a diffi cult one for the US be- cause, in its war on terror, it has a close intelligence relationship with the Sudanese government and in 2005 it fl ew Salah Gosh, the chief of intelligence and one of the architects of the Darfur atrocities, out to Virginia on a private plane for meetings. As for the UN, it is a creature of its mem- bers. So on the Security Council you have China, with large oil imports from Sudan, ready to block any overly intrusive UN measures. In addition, both Russia and China are very wary about UN intervention into RaFD in early 2006). Although they are members of Chadian President Idriss Deby\u2019s own clan of the Zaghawa people, these de- fectors are opposed to him because they do not think he has done enough to protect members of his tribe, the Zaghawa, in Dar- fur, where they are being killed and driven off their lands by the Sudan government\u2019s Janjaweed militias. They also oppose him running for a third term, after amending the constitution in 2005. Theirs is therefore a revolt that seeks to preserve their hold on power, while the FUC\u2019s aim is to challenge the control of the Zaghawa elites of the government. Deby himself is supporting one of the rebel groups in Darfur (SLA-Minawi), and has cut off diplomatic relations with Sudan. He threatened to drive the 200,000 Sudanese refugees now in eastern Chad back into Dar- fur, though he has since backed away from that threat. Therefore, a situation that looked to be as hopeless as it could be, now threatens to get considerably worse. However, none of this is surprising. Crisis Group has been warning for the last 18 months that the Darfur con- fl ict was destabilizing Chad. We have pub- licly predicted as of early 2006 that Chad was about to implode with probable drastic consequences for the refugees and Chadian civilians, but our warning has yet to lead to meaningful international engagement to contain the worst of the violence. While prevention at this stage has little material ",
        "[ 453 ] In 2006, the Crisis Group repeatedly ar- gued that the international community need- ed to pursue three objectives in Darfur. The fi rst was that of civilian protection. The UN must take over from the AU forces in 2006, with a larger force and stronger mandate. The UN has agreed to do so, but the government of Sudan is objecting, and the AU is hesitating. More pressure must be brought to bear to ensure this handover takes place. In the meantime, the UN must approve a stabilisation force to work with the AU mis- sion in protecting civilians and securing the border with Chad. The second objective was to implement ac- countability in Darfur. This means putting in place the UN sanctions immediately. It also means widening the sanctions to target Su- dan\u2019s oil industry. And it means supporting the ICC investigation \u2014 the AU and member states should provide relevant information on a timely basis to the ICC. Member states should also make sure that the ICC has the resources needed to thoroughly investigate Darfur. The third objective was to build a Darfur peace process. This means that the govern- ment of Sudan delegation must represent the new Government of National Unity \u2014 i.e. it must include representatives of the southern SPLM playing a substantive role, and not just the hard-line National Congress Party. The international community, which includes Norway as a key player, must apply consist- atrocities. Now, for the fi rst time, the UN has explicitly recognised that there are cir- cumstances in which failures by states to protect their own populations gives rise to an obligation by the international commu- nity to intervene in that state\u2019s sovereign affairs. Such a responsibility is vested fi rst with the sovereign state itself, but when they are unwilling or unable to ensure such protec- tions, that responsibility must be borne by the broader community of states. However, the responsibility to protect is about much more than intervention. It extends to a whole continuum of obligations from the responsi- bility to prevent crises, to react to situations of compelling human need, and to rebuild in post-confl ict situations, including recovery, reconstruction and reconciliation. In Chad, this means that Deby\u2019s govern- ment has primary responsibility to address those issues fuelling the confl ict. However, the international community must assist, by uniting to push for a delay in the upcoming third term elections, so that a more inclusive political process can be developed. As for Darfur, Khartoum has the lead re- sponsibility to prevent the massacre of its own people but, by its active involvement in the slaughter and displacement of civil- ians in Darfur, it has clearly and wantonly failed in that responsibility. The obligation then shifts to the international community to intervene. should be fulfi lling its responsibility to pre- vent confl ict and protect civilians. The UN held a World Summit in New York in September 2006 to celebrate the 60 th anniversary of the United Nations. It was the largest ever gathering of world lead- ers. There was hope that the Summit would agree major reforms to the UN and take bold decisions on human rights, security and de- velopment. In the end, the Summit was a disappointment, with member states largely failing to take strong action on any of these fronts. However, one signifi cant success was the agreement to acknowledge the doctrine of responsibility to protect as an interna- tional responsibility. Specifi cally the Sum- mit agreed to the following: Each individual State has the responsibil- ity to protect its populations from gen- ocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibil- ity entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through ap- propriate and necessary means. We accept that responsibility and will act in accord- ance with it. This is an historic step, because until now state sovereignty was formally, if not in practice, sacrosanct. This is perhaps under- standable \u2014 no state wants to be the object of coercive intervention by others. How- ever, there are situations, such as Rwanda or Kosovo/a, in which such intervention is the only way to stop genocide and other ",
        "[ 454 ] lizing the whole region, spreading mayhem well beyond the borders of Sudan. The international community needs to get serious about its commitments to prevent genocides, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Until it does so, confl ict in Africa will continue to claim hundreds of thousands of lives each year through disease and malnutri- tion.

The peace process must remain a focus, as in the end the solution to the confl ict in Darfur will only be found in a negotiated settlement.

        "[ 455 ] Introduction I will address two issues in this article, the fi rst concerns the re-engagement of Su- dan with the Confl ict Early Warning and Response Mechanism (CEWARN) in its en- gagement along the borders of neighbouring countries within the Horn of Africa. Second, I will consider the potential and use of an early warning system to support the peace process in Sudan. 1 To make the point that the Sudan peace process, both North/South and that regard- ing Darfur (never mind the East) is going through a diffi cult patch, is merely a state- ment of the obvious. In general the peace agreement remains fragile, although it is still on track. A recent report by the Inter- national Crises Group starts its executive summary as follows: More than a year after it was signed, Su- dan\u2019s Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is showing signs of strain [\u2026] and continues to lack broader support through- out the country, particularly in the North. The current equation for peace in Sudan is a worrying one: the NCP has the capac- C ONFLICT EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT IN S UDAN Dr Jakkie Cilliers has B.Mil (BA), BA Hons, MA (cum laude), D.Litt and D.Phil degrees from the universities of Stellenbosch and South Africa.

There is a real risk of renewed confl ict down the road. 2 When it comes to the application of early warning theory to confl ict prevention prac- tice, we need to \u2018mind the gap\u2019 \u2014 refl ected in a 1996 report on early warning: There appears to be two forms of early warning: one in theory and one in prac- tice. [\u2026] While international organisations frequently articulate an interest in confl ict prevention, in practice they are almost solely concerned with the settlement or management of existing disputes. 3 Different from intelligence systems, which serve a national security purpose where the focus is on high-quality and often secret sources of information, early warning systems typically serve intergovernmental purposes and are based on networks and open sources for their information. Early warning systems originated with the requirement (within hu- manitarian relief agencies) for a single, reli- able source of analysis to serve a coalition of clients rather than a single government. Domestically confl ict early warning systems are complex and fraught with all kinds of problems since they are easily perceived to be agents of or hostile to state security inter- ests within the context of an undemocratic or non-responsive state \u2014 or, as is the case in Sudan \u2014 where state power is contested. Yet, in the absence of a functioning, le- gitimate state system across much of Sudan after several decades of war, the establish- ment of a neutral confl ict prevention and early warning capacity dedicated to support the political transition could fi ll an urgent void \u2014 that of the provision of independent information and analysis. Some general pointers Generically, the aim of conflict early warning is to identify critical developments in a timely manner, so that coherent re- sponse strategies can be formulated to either prevent violent confl ict or limit its destruc- tive effects. Effective early warning involves the collection and analysis of data in a uni- form and systematised way and according 1 The background paper refers to the fact that: \u2018The ultimate objective of the conference is to facilitate a debate led by Sudanese on the appropriateness and the specifi cations of an Early Warning System for Confl ict Prevention in Sudan\u2019. Furthermore, \u2018The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement on January 9 th 2005 is \u2026 a unique opportunity to revive the Sudan engagement to CEWARN, to explore other confl ict areas to be included in an adapted EWS for the Sudan, and to increase the capacity of the government and international community to monitor, prevent and respond to local confl icts\u2019. 2 \u2018Sudan\u2019s Comprehensive Peace Agreement: the long road ahead\u2019, Africa Report No. 106, 31 March 2006, p. i. 3 Netherlands Institute of International Relations, Confl ict Prevention and Early Warning in the Political Practice of International Organizations, January 1996, p. 71.

CEWARN in the Horn of Africa The African Union\u2019s (AU) CEWS at con- tinental level and regional systems includ- ing that of CEWARN in the Horn were es- tablished to avoid inter-state confl ict and secondly to stop national problems from becoming regional headaches. CEWARN is, however, more specifi c and focused than that found elsewhere in Africa. Article 5 on the functions of CEWARN reads, in part, as follows: 1. The functions of CEWARN cover both ear- ly warning and response and shall include the following: to a commonly shared methodology. It re- quires the formulation and communication of analysis and policy options to relevant end-users \u2014 information towards action. In a basic form, confl ict early warning needs to tackle: (cid:129) which issues (manifestations, precipitat- ing, proximate and root causes) underpin and drive the confl ict? (cid:129) which factors put a brake on confl ict and serve as the basis for peace? (cid:129) who are the main stakeholders in the confl ict? (cid:129) what are the practical options available to policy-makers who wish to affect the emerging confl ict, avoid human suffering in the short term and move toward a sus- tainable settlement in the longer term?

The signature of the CEWARN protocol was followed by a series of expert workshops and consultancies that eventually provided the substantive theoreti- cal basis for the subsequent system. 5 CEWARN is in many ways unique. On the one hand it exists as part of the IGAD. On the other it draws heavily on civil society partici- pation. This hybrid is arguably possible since national agencies and civil society organisa- tions from one country naturally coalesce and mobilise in support of common national interests. This has allowed for the uncontested integration of the national components of CE- WARN, the CEWERU\u2019s, 6 into state structures in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya where they are seen to complement existing state security and delivery structures. In simple terms, CEWARN-appointed fi eld monitors provide incident and weekly re- ports through a dedicated National Research Institute 7 to the CEWERU within the coun- try concerned. The CEWERU reports to the CEWARN unit in Addis Ababa where the data is codifi ed and where quality control is performed. Based on a sophisticated analy- sis and reporting tool, CEWARN puts out monthly and alert reports. 8 propriate government ministry, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs (in the case of Ethiopia) and the Offi ce of the President, Provincial Administration and Internal Se- curity (in the case of Kenya). It does so in respect of the following matters in the An- nex to the CEWARN protocol: Part II: information 1. CEWARN shall rely for its operations on information that is collected from the pub- lic domain, particularly in the following areas: a) livestock rustling; b) confl icts over grazing and water points; c) smuggling and illegal trade; d) nomadic movements; e) refugees; f) landmines; g) banditry. At the moment, CEWARN focuses on the increasingly violent pastoral confl ict along border areas that is fuelled by the availabil- ity and presence of small arms. This followed a detailed analysis of the enduring nature of the various cross-border problems and the debilitating impact that armed cattle c) Communicate all such information and analysis to decision-makers of InterGovernmental Authority on De- velopment (IGAD) policy organs and the national governments of mem- ber states. The Annex to the CEWARN Protocol that sets out the \u2018Operating Guidelines for CEWARN\u2019, reads, in part, as follows: Part I: mandate 1. CEWARN is mandated to: a) receive and share information concern- ing potentially violent confl icts as well as their outbreak and escalation in the IGAD region; b) undertake and share analyses of that information; c) develop case scenarios and formulate options for response; d) share and communicate information, analyses and response options; e) carry out studies on specifi c types and areas of confl ict in the IGAD region.

The fi rst Meeting of the CPS was in Entebbe, Uganda, May 2002. A workshop on the Identifi cation of Indicators in November 2002 was followed by various workshops to engender the CEWARN Mechanism (2003). The company VRA undertook the development of the CEWARN Reporter. A second meeting of the CPS was held in Khartoum, March 2003, followed by missions to the Karamoja and Somali Clusters. The selection of NRIs and Training of CCs and FMs followed and the Offi cial opening of the CEWARN Offi ce occurred on 30 June 2003. The CEWARN Protocol entered into force in August 2003 and the TCEW was operationalised in June 2004. 6 National confl ict early warning and response mechanisms. 7 InterAfrica in Ethiopia, Africa Peace Forum in Ethiopia, Centre for Basic Research in Uganda.

A second alert was issued on 9 September 2005 about confl ict between two Ethiopian pastoral communities, the Nyangatom and Dassenech, during which ten persons were killed and 220 cattle were stolen.

        "[ 458 ] what distant relationship between the sys- tem and its response mechanism (national governments, the IGAD secretariat and its political masters) that still has to prove it- self in practice. Hence the conclusion in an earlier ISS report: Technically, the CEWARN system is com- plex and authoritative but has not yet closed the gap between analysis, options and actions. It is diffi cult to see how this will be possible in the longer term with- out the co-location of CEWARN (in Addis Ababa) and IGAD (in Djibouti) and the development of an integrated confl ict prevention, management and response system similar to that working in West Africa and under development in Southern Africa. Without the mechanisms to har- ness and focus political will to action by IGAD Member States, the danger is that CEWARN may not be able to operation- alise its confl ict prevention ambitions at the regional level.\u2019 10 Admittedly this conclusion does not give credit to the second and potentially fruitful focus of CEWARN, namely to initiate and support local confl ict prevention working with and through local structures. Early warning systems are necessarily tailored to their particular function and client(s). Each end-user (such as the Peace for confl ict prevention and management on the continent [...] The conceptual ma- turity of the regional system also refl ects a commitment by West African leaders to engage with the extensive regional con- fl ict systems in the region. They have in- stitutionalised (on paper if not always in practice) the linkage between good gov- ernance and confl ict prevention through the adoption of a supplementary protocol on democracy and good governance. Whereas West Africa has the most politi- cally developed and mature system, IGAD/ CEWARN is potentially the most sophisti- cated available amongst the RECs, if still limited in geographical scope. Beyond the technical and conceptual chal- lenges associated with early warning and re- sponse, the single biggest challenge faced by all early warning and response systems is linking good analysis with timely action. The linkage to timely action means clar- ity, proximity and engagement with those institutions responsible for action. In the case of the AU the key users for the CEWS are: the Peace and Security Council, the of- fi ce of the Chairperson of the Commission and that of the Commissioner for Peace and Security, other departments within the AU and various components of the PSC system such as the Panel of the Wise. In the case of CEWARN there is a complicated and some- Currently CEWARN is active in two clus- ters (as pilot projects), namely the Karamo- ja (Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia bor- der) and Somali (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somali) clusters. Apparently a welcome expansion into the Sudan/Uganda border area is be- ing considered. The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) concluded a 2005 paper on the CEWS 9 by remarking that: The ECOWAS system is at an early stage of development but represents the most com- prehensive and logically integrated system 9 Jakkie Cilliers, \u2018Towards a Continental Early Warning System for Africa\u2019, Institute for Security Studies Paper, No. 102, April 2005. 10 Other conclusions related to costs, the utility of the CEWARN methodology at the regional as apposed to the local level and the requirements for relatively transparency open sources and civil society involvement.

Additional provision would have to be made for dissemination, liaison functions, a briefi ng room replete with maps and graphs, as well as additional experts to feed and add in the analysis that is generated by various other components within the UN and other systems. In contrast to the cautious approach adopted by CEWARN, a public dissemination strategy in the interests of its primary benefi - ciaries \u2014 ordinary Sudanese \u2014 is a key suc- cess factor for such a system. Once quality assurance and information dissemination/ outreach systems have been put in place the only outstanding item would be the devel- opment of geographical information pres- entation tools. The practical phases in the establishment of this system are relatively straightforward and consist of: the choice and customisation of an established system, baseline research, implementation (deployment and training) and maintenance. Choice Time and cost considerations would fa- vour the choice of an established and ma- ture system such as the Integrated Data for Event Analysis (IDEA) that has, amongst others, been adopted by FAST Interna- tional and customised for pastoral con- fl ict by CEWARN. Fully fl edged IDEA sys- tems have a wide focus and include more requirement for a system of confl ict early warning to: (cid:129) provide independent information on the state of (in)security/the implementation of the peace process in an objective and non-partisan manner to the government of National Unity in Khartoum, the gov- ernment of South Sudan in Juba, partici- pating State governments, the UN system, donors/partners and critically, ordinary Sudanese; (cid:129) initiate local confl ict prevention action (for example, through links with tribal leaders) or inform prevention action at the state or national level. Given the limited information fl ows in Su- dan, any system would have to rely on fi eld monitors in each participating state for the provision of event data. Each participatory state could probably be \u2018covered\u2019 by an av- erage of fi ve fi eld monitors \u2014 costing less than US $1,000 per month per state. These monitors would have to be trained and have access to appropriate communication means with one of the two coordination unit, one in Khartoum (for the GNU) and the other in Juba (for the GSS) 11 and it would have to build-in appropriate accountability and con- sultative mechanisms through which all key stakeholders are brought to the table. Each of the two coordination units would require an offi ce, computers, a minimum of three staff and Security Council of the AU) necessarily needs a system to meet its particular needs, resources, organisational culture and re- sponse mechanisms. CEWARN in the Horn is a particularly distinct and carefully de- signed system to meet particular and specifi c requirements. But equally the early warning system for the ECOWAS Mediation and Se- curity Council differs from that being de- veloped for SADC and its Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation. This view leads to two obvious conclu- sions. On the one hand a degree of practical scepticism appears to be warranted on the idea that Africa would be able to develop an integrated CEWS system. It is more like- ly that the AU and each regional economic community (REC) would develop an own system tailored to the specifi c requirements and usage of each organisation within a loose cooperative relationship between sys- tems. More relevant to this paper, it probably rules out the option of expanding the CE- WARN (dedicated to pastoral confl ict across common borders) system for use in the Su- dan (i.e. at national level) without consider- able adaptation. An early warning system for Sudan The fact that CEWARN may not be ap- propriate for use in support of the transition process in Sudan should not detract from the 11 Both coordination units would feed into a single database so that all the components of system for Sudan would be available at both units.

        "[ 460 ] research and analysis capacity that can ac- cess and digest these results. Conclusion In an ideal world there would be little im- pediment for the various negotiating parties in Sudan to agree on the establishment of a neutral and separate system that tracks con- fl ict or security concerns in the country. 13 In the real world, control of information fl ows is deeply political and security is not a neutral, value-free concept. The political independ- ence and integrity of a confl ict early warning system for the Sudan and the choices regard- ing the organisations/institutions with which it is formally affi liated and of its key staff are critical matters if such a system is to survive and traverse the turbulent domestic politics of Sudan \u2014 in many ways more important than the challenges presented by the diverse ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity, and limited infrastructure, that will inevitably complicate implementation. While this article did not discuss the re- engagement of Sudan within the current op- erations of CEWARN, this is an obvious re- quirement if the region is to move towards a regional confl ict response mechanism. Having Sudan commit fully and unequivocally to the Implementation The most important aspect of implementa- tion would be the choice of the hosting in- stitution, oversight and political/domestic ownership considerations. The associated processes would imply a series of partici- patory workshops with political and civil society actors, various training activities and the identifi cation of the parameters of the system (e.g. the decision on which states would be covered), defi nition of the types of events, etc.. Maintenance Refresher training, ongoing quality as- surance, IT and other ongoing support, including support from the software sys- tem supplier. Given the intensity that will be required from a Sudan human security early warning system output would be high \u2014 probably requiring weekly rather than monthly reports. It would be crucial for a Sudan confl ict early warning system to be able to feed off the extensive applied research that is being done for the multitude of agencies engaged with the transition process. To this end the establishment of the system discussed in these pages should be complemented by a than 200 different event types that would require limited additional input for ap- plication in the Sudan. System costs are diffi cult to estimate but could range from, say, US $30,000 (including customisation) to several hundred thousand dollars if de- veloped commercially. Base-line study All confl ict response systems start off with a base-line assessment on the level of in- security and threats to human security \u2014 and such an assessment is absolutely criti- cal in Sudan to build sustainable peace. Sudan does not have suffi cient or appro- priate data upon which to plan much of the post-confl ict reconstruction and devel- opment projects that are unfolding at the moment and that will do so in the years that lie ahead. Perhaps the most press- ing of these examples relate to the infor- mation requirements upon which to plan the various security sector reform projects that are needed. Various mechanisms exist that could assist in this regard, including crime victimisation studies and the like. A number of applied research survey tech- niques and related efforts could help fi ll the information gap that will inevitably constrain and limit response strategies. 12 12 Admittedly, some efforts are already underway to map Sudan\u2019s insecurity. For example, a Human Security Baseline Assessment in Sudan is [at the time of writing] one week into its fi rst household surveys of small arms demand and effects. The largest (500-1000) of the undertaking concerns Rumbek and its immediate environs. A second, smaller initiative concerns the Juba area (250-500 households). The deteriorating security situation in and around Yei made an effort to conduct a survey there too chancy to proceed but discussions on conducting surveys in Wau, Malakal and Kapoeta have occurred. The project plans to conduct similar surveys in the East and in the West over the next 12 months. Elsewhere a system to track and monitor returnees to Southern Sudan already works towards a Joint Operations Centre. 13 For legal and practical considerations it would not be possible to simply extend CEWARN to cover Sudan. CEWARN is established within the framework of IGAD and at the behest of member states and such a decision would require changes to the legal protocol that governs CEWARN as well as the legal agreement of the negotiating parties to the Government of National Unity of Sudan. Second, the CEWARN system would have to be reconfi gured to allow for a wider system of event data than its current format optimised for pastoral confl ict. ",
        "[ 461 ] Yet at the current stage of the peace process a confl ict early warning system could go a long way to removing the provision of key confl ict information from contested politi- cal control. Ideally, such a system should be developed with the full cooperation and support of the parties to the CPA, the parties to the talks on Darfur and elsewhere. This \u2018best\u2019 solution may, however, not be prac- tically achievable within reasonable time. While is theoretically possible for the UN to establish an independent mechanism to monitor and track violence in Sudan, or for donors to fund various Sudanese partners to perform such a function, the option to appoint an independent neutral agent to implement (but not staff) an early warning system or to create an entirely new unit for this purpose in the Sudan may be less desir- able but inevitable. tic security that must lie with the govern- ment of Sudan and its various agencies. Any measures in support of the transition in Sudan should therefore have, as its ultimate purpose, the building of state systems and act in support of legitimate post-transition national institutions. A confl ict early warn- ing system for Sudan can, therefore, only be of a transitory nature. The challenge for Sudan is the absence of legitimate national systems in the interim and the vagrancies of the transitional period that lie ahead that will severely degrade the capacity of na- tional security agencies and institutions. The development of a dedicated system to track confl ict trends related to (in)security in support of the Sudan peace process should therefore be seen for what it is \u2014 a tempo- rary arrangement that should, in time, be- come part of the state system or fade away. commitments refl ected in the CEWARN pro- tocol would be good for Sudan, the region and for IGAD. The Horn of Africa faces many challenges of which armed-resource competi- tion across borders is a key ingredient. With peace in Sudan the opportunities and de- mands that will be placed on CEWARN to extend its operations along the complex and divisive boundaries in the South (in particu- lar) present numerous challenges, as would Darfur and the situation in the East. Once CEWARN has expanded to cover these addi- tional border areas the major challenge for IGAD remains the development of a compre- hensive response system at the national and regional level similar to that under develop- ment in other regions such as ECOWAS.

R EGULATION ( EC ) NO 1717/2006 OF THE E UROPEAN P ARLIAMENT AND THE C OUNCIL OF 15 N OVEMBER 2006 ESTABLISHING AN INSTRUMENT FOR S TABILITY [ 483 ] 1 Opinion of the European Parliament delivered on 6 July 2006 (not yet published in the Offi cial Journal) and Council Decision of 7 November 2006. ",
        "6. The European Council Declaration on Combating Terrorism of 25 March 2004 called for counter-terrorist objectives to be integrated into external assistance programmes. Moreover, the EU Millennium Strategy on the prevention and control of organised crime, adopted by the Council on 27 March 2000, calls for closer cooperation with third countries. 7. Post-crisis stabilisation requires a sustained and fl exible en- gagement from the international community, in particular in the fi rst years after a crisis, on the basis of integrated transition strategies. 8. Implementation of programmes of assistance in times of crisis and political instability requires specifi c measures to ensure fl exibility in decision-making and budget allocation, as well as enhanced measures to ensure coherence with bilateral aid and mechanisms for the pooling of donor funds, including the delegation of public authority tasks through indirect centralised management. 9. The Resolutions of the European Parliament and the Conclusions of the Council following the Commission Communications on the Linking of Relief, Rehabilitation and Development emphasise the need to ensure effective bridging between operations fi nanced from different Community fi nancing instruments in the context of crisis. 10. In order to address the above issues in an effective and timely manner specifi c fi nancial resources and fi nancing instruments are required that can work in a manner complementary to humani- tarian aid and long-term cooperation instruments. Humanitarian aid should continue to be delivered under Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid 2 . 11. In addition to the measures agreed with partner countries in the context of the policy framework for cooperation established un- der the related Community instruments for external assistance, the Community must be able to provide assistance which addresses major global and transnational issues having a potentially desta- bilising effect. 12. The 2001 \u201cGuidelines for strengthening operational coordination between the Community, represented by the Commission, and the Member States in the fi eld of external assistance\" emphasise the need for enhanced coordination of EU external assistance. 13. This Regulation establishes for the period 2007 to 2013 a fi nancial envelope which constitutes the prime reference amount for the budgetary authority according to point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound fi nancial management 3 . 14. The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/ EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission 4 . 15. This Regulation aims at covering the scope of and replacing a number of existing Regulations concerning Community external assistance; those Regulations should therefore be repealed. 16. Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be suffi ciently achieved by the Member States, because of the need for concerted multilateral response in the areas defi ned in this Regulation, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, taking ac- [ 484 ] 2 OJ L 163, 2.7.1996, p. 1.

        "count of the scale and global effects of the measures provided for herein, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Title I O BJECTIVES AND S COPE Article 1 Objectives 1. The Community shall undertake development cooperation meas- ures, as well as fi nancial, economic and technical cooperation measures with third countries under the conditions set out in this Regulation. 2.

In the exceptional and unforeseen situations referred to in para- graph 1, the Community may also provide technical and fi nancial assistance not expressly covered by the specifi c areas of assist- ance set out in paragraph 2. Such assistance shall be limited to Exceptional Assistance Measures as referred to in Article 6(2), which: \u2014 fall within the general scope and specifi c aims set out in Ar- ticle 1(a), and \u2014 are limited in duration to the period laid down in Article 6(2), and \u2014 would normally be eligible under the other Community in- struments for external assistance, but which, in accordance with Article 2, should be addressed through this Regulation because of the need to respond rapidly to a situation of crisis or emerging crisis.

In addition, joint consultations shall be carried out between the Commission, Member States, and other donors where appropriate, in order to ensure that the cooperation activities of the Community are complementary to those of the Member States and other donors. Other stakeholders may be associated where appropriate. 5. Each Multi-country Strategy Paper shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by a Multi-annual Indicative Programme sum- marising the priority areas selected for Community fi nancing, the specifi c objectives, the expected results and timeframe of Community support and the indicative fi nancial allocation, overall and for each priority area. The fi nancial allocations may be given in the form of a range where necessary. 6. The Multi-annual Indicative Programmes shall determine the fi nancial allocations for each programme using transparent criteria, based on the needs and performance of the partner countries or regions concerned and taking into account the particular diffi culties faced by countries or regions in crisis or confl ict. 7. Multi-annual Indicative Programmes, and any revisions or ex- tensions thereof, shall be adopted in accordance with the pro- cedure referred to in Article 22(2).
