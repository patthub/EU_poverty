        "Editorial 2 SIGMA 01 07 building bridges E d i t o r i a l For many years now, Eurostat and the national statistical institutes have been very active in the fi eld of international statistical cooperation. The role of statistics has become increasingly important in the context of the most recent enlargements of the European Union, the extension of the European neighbourhood policy and continued EU support to developing countries. Statistical cooperation helps develop and strengthen statistical capacity building in the partner countries and regions on the one hand, which in turn serves to improve governance and policymaking. On the other hand, statistical cooperation promotes the harmonisation of nomenclature and methodologies with international standards. Both aspects are essential in order to produce better-quality data and harmonised comparable indicators, needed to measure progress. This current issue of Sigma presents examples of the many facets of statistical cooperation, in terms of diversity of players and cooperation activities. highlights include the role of Commission services in the design and implementation of EU cooperation strategies and programmes. The issue also describes the experiences and views of international organisations such as the World Bank and the UN. It presents too the point of view of some regional and national partners and examples of bilateral cooperation from members of the European statistical system in Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia. Finally, we continue the series of presentations of the NSIs. In this issue you will also meet the Director-General of the Statistical Service of Cyprus. herv\u00e9 Carr\u00e9 Director-General, Eurostat sigma_EN.indd 2 12-04-2007 12:14:44 ",

        "E urostat Director-General Herv\u00e9 Carr\u00e9 wants to give new momentum to the unique partnership in the European statistical system (ESS). In his first 10 months as the head of the EU Statistical Office, he and Deputy Director-General Marie Bohat\u00e1 have visited 16 national statistical institutes to discuss issues of common interest and concern. Governance issues like the code of practice and its implementation, prior- ity setting, the next five-year programme, the new European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy and the creation of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Body were some of the topics on the agenda. Herv\u00e9 Carr\u00e9 wants to give new momentum to the European statistical system \u2018S hortly after my arrival in Eurostat, I became aware of a certain lack of dialogue between the partners of the ESS and a need to establish a closer relation- ship. This is the reason for our visits to the national statistical institutes\u2019, says Mr Carr\u00e9. \u2018Currently we are renewing the basis for the European statis- tical system. We are discussing the \u201cstatistical law\u201d and how to improve governance and the operational efficiency of the ESS in the Statistical Programme Committee. We are building something better and this is the kind of work I enjoy a lot!\u2019, says Mr Carr\u00e9 with enthusiasm. The new European Statistical Governance Advisory Body and the new CEIES, the European Advisory Committee on Com- munity Statistical Information Policy will be key to success. The Advisory Body will play an important role in the imple- mentation of the code of practice and the further boosting of the quality of statistics in the ESS. It will have five mem- bers selected from among experts possessing outstanding competence in the field of statistics. Eurostat will take part as an observer. The Advisory Body complements the Euro- pean governance structure and enhances the independ- ence, integrity and accountability of the ESS over and above already-existing structures. It will produce an annual report Eurostat Director-General, herv\u00e9 Carr\u00e9, says that reducing the response burden doesn\u2019t mean giving up the quest for high- quality statistics.

        "on the implementation of the code of practice and it will be involved in the process leading to a quality label for Euro- pean official statistics. \u2018It is still early days, but later on we will discuss with the na- tional statistical institutes how to define a label. The idea is to have a sort of appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e for official Eu- ropean statistics. Today, many institutions produce data on European or national level, but do they produce high-quality statistics? Should their data also be called official statistics? The Advisory Body will be central in the discussions with the ESS on this issue, as its sister organisations in Member States are on a national level\u2019, says Mr Carr\u00e9. Majority of users hand-in-hand with the Advisory Body comes the new Advi- sory Committee, which will see a drastically reduced number of members \u2014 from 79 to 25. Members will come from civil society, such as representatives of universities and scientific institutions, and institutional users of statistics, for example the European Parliament and the Council. Mr Carr\u00e9 does not fear that the reduced number of members will make user representation suffer. \u2018The goal was to make the Committee a smaller, more effi- cient body that can serve a more strategic role with regard to the development of European statistical information poli- cies. In fact the majority of members will now actually be real users, compared to a majority of national producers in the previous body\u2019, he says. The Committee will play a more important role in ensuring that user requirements and the burden on information pro- viders and producers are taken into account. It will also coor- dinate the strategic objectives and priorities of the Commu- nity statistical information policy. Making things simpler Linked to the burden for respondents is the \u2018Communication on the reduction of response burden, simplification and pri- ority-setting in the field of Community statistics\u2019 adopted by the European Commission in November 2006. The commu- nication reflects issues that have been high on the agenda of Eurostat, Member States and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council for several years. And although most agree that the burden of statistics is only perceived, Mr Carr\u00e9 thinks it is important to deal with. \u2018Although statistical reporting is only a small part of the administrative burden on businesses, we should of course support the endeavour to minimise the response burden in every way that we can\u2019, he says. \u2018We should systematically analyse how we can simplify data collection and ask ourselves questions. Do we need to have the data every month, or is quarterly data enough? Can we collect some data every three years instead of every second year? The proposal to introduce a single flow reporting sys- tem for trade data in Intrastat is another example of how to cut the response burden. In fact to divide it by two\u2019, he says. The European approach Mr Carr\u00e9 underlines that looking at reducing the response burden doesn\u2019t mean giving up the quest for high-quality statistics. It is possible to have both and gives as one exam- ple the flash estimate of the harmonised indices of consumer prices (hICP). It is released by Eurostat the last working day of the current month and to produce the euro-area aggre- gate, Eurostat only uses data from a few Member States. \u2018This is an excellent example of the \u2018European approach\u2019. We manage to release high-quality hICP estimates very quickly, which is what is requested by European policymakers, the European Central Bank, the markets etc. The flash hICP is highly appreciated and widely used, thanks to its reliability and timeliness\u2019, Mr Carr\u00e9 says. he believes Eurostat will release more data this way in the future and also mentions other possibilities of organising work within the ESS. \u2018In the far future we might also see more specialisation among the NSIs. Price statistics could perhaps be produced by one NSI and labour data by another. I think we can draw some lessons from the German federal system\u2019, he says. Priorities Priority-setting is also high on Mr Carr\u00e9\u2019s agenda and has been a main thread through the discussions with the Mem- ber States. The next five-year programme, 2008\u201312, covers all European policy areas and there are priorities for each field. New actions will be discussed with the Member States and subjected to cost benefit analyses. \u2018It is of course difficult to foresee the needs of European policy in five years. Look at crime statistics for example, they were not on the agenda five years ago. Political develop- ments drive the development of statistics\u2019, he says. Mr Carr\u00e9 believes that Eurostat and the ESS have to become better at anticipating new areas of statistics and in general be more proactive. \u2018I heard a discussion on globalisation in the Economic and Fi- nancial Affairs Council recently and I realised that we should think about how we could provide a toolbox that shows policymakers the effects of globalisation on Europe. We shouldn\u2019t wait for them to ask for the data. We should start preparing now! however, I\u2019m not advocating new statistics, I think there are plenty of data available that could be used for this purpose\u2019, he says.

        "For many years, Eurostat has been active in the field of statistical coop- eration with non-EU countries, with the aim of strengthening their statistical capacities and obtaining statistics from them. This work has become even more important with the increasing awareness of the role of statis- tics, especially in the context of the most recent enlargement of the Union and the Eu- ropean neighbourhood policy. Sigma met Pieter Everaers, Director of Eurostat Direc- torate E \u2018Agricultural and environment statistics; Statistical cooperation\u2019 and Arunas Butkevicius and James Whitworth, the heads of the main units in Eurostat responsible for international cooperation and for coordinating and delivering technical support to non-EU countries and regions. Promoting statistics to enhance regional integration \u2018The overall objective of international statisti- cal cooperation is both to assist benefici- ary countries and regions in developing their statistical systems, and to provide harmonised and re- liable data for these countries to Commission services and Member States. Of course, we need to distinguish between the role and scope of our Unit E4 \u201cStatistical cooperation with European and Mediterranean countries\u201d, and Unit E5 \u201cInternational statistical cooperation\u201d\u2019, says Pieter Everaers. Geographically, Unit E4 \u2018Statistical cooperation with Euro- pean and Mediterranean countries\u2019 covers the countries which need to comply with the statistical acquis of the EU (as is the case for the acceding, candidate and western Bal- kan countries) and those that aim to develop their statistical systems using the acquis as a target framework (the Euro- pean neighbourhood policy countries). Compliance with the acquis is a prerequisite for membership of the European Union, and the assessment of the compliance level for the statistical acquis come from Eurostat. Concretely, there is a direct involvement of Eurostat, from Unit E4 and technical units, in statistical assistance programmes. The focus is on steering and supporting beneficiary countries in their ef- forts to build up a sustainable statistical system and to de- liver harmonised statistical data. On the other hand, Unit E5 \u2018International statistical coopera- tion\u2019 covers relations with the rest of the world and interna- tional organisations. It is a service-oriented unit providing support upon request primarily to Commission services and to Eurostat units in their relations with international organisations. The focus is more on advocacy, coordination, advice, training and capacity building and less on coaching or consultancy to individual countries. \u2018If a country does not have reliable statistics, you cannot have reliable politics\u2019, says Pieter Everaers, Eurostat Director of Agricultural and Environment Statistics and Statistical Cooperation. here he is together with heads of Unit Arunas Butkevicius (left) and James Whitworth (right).

        "\u2018Both units have a role as facilitators between internal Com- mission services and external players, whether countries or regional organisations\u2019, explains Mr Everaers. \u2018The difference is that, in the case of Unit E4, we have to be more proactive. The approach of Unit E5 is more reactive, as we are not tak- ing the initiative.\u2019 A clear Commission mandate \u2018Unit E4 is expected to make sure that harmonised compara- ble data are available for the services of the European Com- mission for example the Directorates-General (DGs) for En- largement and External Relations and to the public at large. We have a clear Commission mandate linked to a policy\u2019, explains Arunas Butkevicius, head of Unit E4. The regions covered by Unit E4 are the 12 new Member States (only for the handling of the statistical assistance pro- grammes), the candidate countries (Turkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), the western Balkan countries (Albania, Serbia including Kosovo under UNSCR 1244, Montenegro and Bosnia and herzegovina) and the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) countries which in- clude six Tacis (Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan) and 10 Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian Authority). \u2018For all these countries, we have to design, implement and evaluate huge technical assistance programmes and moni- tor the development of their statistical systems towards compliance with European and international standards. We work mainly on big EU programmes, under the leadership of DG Enlargement (for acceding and candidate countries) and the EuropeAid Cooperation Office, (for western Balkans and ENP countries). The most efficient way for us to imple- ment the acquis is to use funding from these DGs\u2019 adds Mr Butkevicius. \u2018This particular instrument started in 1997, and the total accumulative amount is already approaching 100 million euro.\u2019 Global advocates for statistics \u2018The role of our unit\u2019 continues James Whitworth, head of Unit E5, \u2018is mainly advisory. We are advocates for statistics. We provide advice and assistance to the directorates- general in Brussels (DG Development, DG External Relations and EuropeAid), to the delegations around the world, the Eurostat\u2019s Unit E4 \u2018Statistical cooperation with European and Mediterranean countries\u2019 covers the countries which need to comply with the statistical acquis of the EU and those that aim to develop their statistical systems using the acquis as a target framework.

        "beneficiaries and partners. Although the \u201crest of the world\u201d countries have no obligation to comply with the acquis , in many cases they do want to have comparable data with that of the EU.\u2019 The Commission\u2019s cooperation policy is defined by DGs Development and External Relations. \u2018It is at an early stage that we try to highlight the statistical component of the programmes\u2019, says Mr Whitworth. \u2018The funding is provided by EuropeAid, and the programmes are managed by the delegations. The launch of a statistical policy is increasingly recipient-driven. The beneficiaries have a great say in the definition of a project. Our expertise concerns the identifi- cation, planning, implementation and evaluation of statisti- cal projects or the statistical elements of more wide-ranging development projects. We are also producing a set of guidelines for delegations to help them to manage statistical programmes.\u2019 \u2018An important aspect of our cooperation is that the existing programmes have a regional scope, such as CAN and in Latin America, SADC, Comesa, Ecowas, WAEMU, Cemac, Palop, Caricom in ACP countries, or Asean in Asia. We only deal with individual countries occasionally. We offer our statistical ex- pertise only upon request and when we do so, we are in a way promoting regional integration. That is where our value added lies. A typical regional programme will run for around five years at a cost of 2 to 5 million euro.\u2019 A need for improved coordination When asked about weaknesses of European statistical coop- eration, Mr Whitworth replies: \u2018In general, one of the biggest problems in technical cooperation is the lack of coordination amongst donors. It is difficult for each of us to know what the other is doing. There are a lot of donor countries and inter- national organisations with whom we are in contact: all UN regional commissions, the World Bank and all the regional development banks and domain-specific organisations such as UNFP, FAO, WhO, Unesco. We have recently convened an Eurostat\u2019s Unit E5 \u2018International statistical cooperation\u2019 covers relations with the world outside of Europe and the Mediterranean countries and international organisations. It is a service-oriented unit providing support upon request primarily to Commission services and to Eurostat units in their relations with international organisations.

        "Advisory Group on the coordination of EU technical coop- eration in sub-Saharan Africa which we hope will go some way to solving the problem, but of course this initiative must fit into global initiatives, such as the Paris21 consortium.\u2019 \u2018In this area, the message is to keep the momentum we have been building up for the last decade. At first, international organisations did not talk to each other and now they do. More remains to be done but there has been progress.\u2019 Butkevicius adds: \u2018This need for better communication and coordination also exists within the Commission services and the EU. For example, given the number of regional pro- grammes, such as Phare, Cards and Medstat, we need to avoid duplicating effort and funding. The annual forums regularly organised by us, such as the Management Group on Statisti- cal Cooperation meetings, aim to resolve these issues.\u2019 The advantage for Unit E4 is that the results of cooperation activities can be assessed in terms of data becoming avail- able. \u2018however for Unit E5,\u2019 explains Mr Whitworth, \u2018it is dif- ficult to perceive the statistical results and the impact of the cooperation. The goal in our case is to increase the statistical capacity of developing countries in order to be able to assess the effectiveness of development policies and to monitor poverty assessment strategies and benchmark the millen- nium development goals. And here the results are normally not immediately visible.\u2019 A source of technical expertise and regional integration Regarding the strengths of European statistical cooperation, Mr Everaers says: \u2018Cooperation is a question of both exper- tise and funding. The first point is that EU countries and the European Commission are the main donors and the second point is that we have, in Eurostat and in the national statisti- cal institutes of the Member States, a wide variety of techni- cal expertise.\u2019 For Mr Butkevicius, the assets of Unit E4 are \u2018the Commis- sion mandate, the fact that financial resources are clearly defined and that the cooperation results can be measured. The fact that we have in our database thousands of data se- ries from the new Members States comparable with those of the old Member States is a proof of the success of European cooperation\u2019. \u2018In addition, Eurostat has a lot to offer as regards regional integration\u2019, says Mr Whitworth. \u2018We have had some good success stories, such as the WAEMU project in West Af- rica on harmonised price statistics which attained the set objectives and the political needs. We have some very good practices and we are going to ask the Advisory Group to build on them.\u2019 Main challenges for the future The establishment of common standards, as referred to by Mr Butkevicius, \u2018is of particular interest to the EU. The main challenge, however,\u2019 he continues, \u2018is to help to establish a proper place for statistics in the relevant political processes, especially in the ENP countries, where they already have relatively well-developed statistical systems. In general, we should promote a service-oriented culture adjusting the existing cooperation instruments to the changing political situation in these countries, over which we have no control. Let me quote, for example, the need for a census in Kosovo and the impact of Montenegro\u2019s independence\u2019. \u2018There is also the issue of a country\u2019s absorption capacity, as it is difficult to change or to build from scratch the entire statistical system in a short period\u2019, says Mr Butkevicius. \u2018Moreover, there is an additional challenge in some cases: a change of culture and mentality is needed, as was the case in the eastern European countries. Eurostat\u2019s role is a main factor in ensuring that these issues are addressed in a cooperative way.\u2019 Involving the decision-makers in developing countries \u2018Advocacy is a major issue for us. We need to get the deci- sion-makers in developing countries to take ownership of the projects,\u2019 explains Mr Whitworth. \u2018On the one hand, we have statisticians who do not need to be convinced as to the importance of statistics, on the other, decision-makers from both the donors and the developing countries. Those on the donor side are beginning to give a higher profile to statis- tics in their development plans because of the need for con- crete results to justify to the taxpayer increasing amounts of development aid. One area where more work needs to be done is amongst decision-makers in developing countries, as statistics have to compete for resources with other devel- opment projects.\u2019 \u2018Statistical cooperation may be regarded as a tool that helps enable a more effective distribution of wealth, which in turn promotes greater national stability\u2019, as Mr Everaers remarks. \u2018If a country does not have reliable statistics, you cannot have reliable politics. And this is clearly a fundamental underlying part of the Community policy\u2019, he ends.

        "\u2018Statistics are instrumental in the EU\u2019s cooperation policies\u2019 The European Commission\u2019s cooperation policy is defi ned by the Directorates-General (DGs) for External Relations and Development and implemented by the EuropeAid Cooperation Offi ce. DG External Relations represents the EU in third coun- tries, fostering cooperation and promoting dialogue with partners. It includes the European neighbourhood policy, aimed at building a particularly strong partnership be- tween the enlarged EU and EU neighbours to the east and on the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Its cooperation projects are fi nanced by the common EU budget. DG Development\u2019s mandate is to enhance development policies in all developing countries worldwide and to over- see the programming of aid in Africa, Caribbean and Pacifi c (ACP) countries. DG Development\u2019s actions are fi nanced by the European Development Fund, which is not part of the EU budget, but funded by Member States separately. The EuropeAid Cooperation Offi ce was set up in 2001 as the single Commission DG to ensure that the EU\u2019s fi nancial and technical support throughout the world is deployed wisely and eff ectively. Its mission is to implement the external aid instruments of the Commission funded by the EU budget and the European Development Fund. EuropeAid is respon- sible for all phases of the project cycle \u2014 from the identifi ca- tion of programmes and projects to their implementation, monitoring and evaluation, which ensures the achievement of the objectives of the programmes established by the Di- rectorates-General for External Relations and Development and approved by the Commission. In a wider context, EuropeAid manages funds as part of the Commission\u2019s external assistance. EuropeAid is also involved in initiatives to improve programming systems and their content, to establish policy evaluation programmes and to develop mechanisms for feeding back evaluation results. To this end, statistical indicators are instrumental in helping to monitor progress. Sigma met Eric Deschoenmaeker from DG Development and Tom Leemans and Antonia Parera Nicolau from EuropeAid, to get a closer view of the role statistics play in the Commis- sion\u2019s external cooperation policy. Country and regional programmes Statistics is not a separate policy area in the European Union\u2019s cooperation policy, as are environment, infrastruc- ture or agriculture etc. They do, however, play an increas- ingly important role and are used to measure the eff ects of projects and changes in diff erent policy areas. Each country and region has its own specifi c programme and strategy. The fi nancial envelopes are programmed for six years at a time. The next period is 2007\u201313. For every coun- try a maximum of two focal sectors are identifi ed. The main sectors are infrastructure, environment, agriculture, society, education and health. The programmes are demand-driven and are defi ned out of the needs of the recipient country or region, based on their own national strategies and in coordi- nation with other donors. \u2018At this stage, the countries may or may not pay attention to statistics. Demands are so far mostly ad hoc or for a spe- cial need, for example for a population census. Everyone is aware that statistics are important of course for sound poli- cymaking and follow-up, but it is a horizontal issue impor- tant across all sectors and not threaded in the same way as environment, health or transport\u2019, says Mr Deschoenmaeker, who works in the unit in charge of Budget Support and Eco- nomic Governance in DG Development. \u2018We try to advocate for statistics and explain that although it is imperative to feed people, a food crisis is easier to manage if you know where the grain is and at what price it is sold in diff erent regions of the country\u2019, says Mr Leemans from the unit responsible for business, trade and regional integration in EuropeAid. T oday the European Union \u2014 the European Commission and the Member States \u2014 accounts for 55 % of the world\u2019s overseas assistance, making it the world\u2019s largest donor. The European Commission manages one fi fth of this amount, which in 2006 was more than EUR 6 billion. A recent study has confi rmed that statis- tics are instrumental in the context of the Commission\u2019s development and cooperation policies with third countries, although there is no real strategy for the Commission\u2019s support to statistics. \u00a9 EC 10 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 10 12-04-2007 12:15:15 ",
        "Towards budget support The Commission\u2019s current trend is moving towards a holis- tic approach to funding, rather than investing in individual projects \u2014 so called \u2018budget support\u2019. \u2018Budget support means that we give money directly to a country\u2019s treasury to provide the country with fi nancial re- sources to support its own poverty reduction policy. There are of course a number of conditions to be fulfi lled for a country to be eligible for such an instrument. There must be prospects for macroeconomic stability, for sound public fi - nances management and a strategy should also be in place to deal with poverty reduction\u2019, says Ms Parera Nicolau, work- ing in the EuropeAid unit responsible for macroeconomic quality support to geographical units and delegations. \u2018Before, we used to mainly fund projects such as building schools, redrafting the curriculum, improving school books etc. Now we try to support sectors or national policies, by having extensive policy dialogue and using national budg- et procedures, to increase ownership and sustainability. We therefore increasingly give money directly to the State budget and therefore increase national resources to imple- ment agreed reforms, investments and policies. Together with the government, we defi ne clear objectives that can be objectively measured, for example increased enrolments of children \u2014 both boys and girls \u2014 in primary schools, at- tendance in health centres or the level of fi nancial resources allocated for a particular sector. We try as far as possible to focus on output indicators that indicate improvement in the quality of public services delivered to the population, and that are good proxies of poverty\u2019, says Mr Leemans. \u2018Budget support means that there is a greater need for in- dicators, and therefore for quality statistics, to measure if a policy action is successful, and to what extent. In order to ensure that the set objectives have been achieved, it is of utmost importance to have a reliable underlying statistical system in place\u2019, he continues. Statistics that count EuropeAid has recently carried out an evaluation of the Commission\u2019s support for statistics in third countries over the period 1996\u20132005. It confi rmed that there was no real strategy for the Commission\u2019s support to statistics and that statistics have been instrumental rather than a policy dimen- sion in the context of the Commission\u2019s development and economic cooperation with third countries. Over the nine-year period, some 160 statistical projects and programmes were identifi ed for a total expenditure amount of EUR 335 million. In addition, specifi c statistical interven- tions such as the analysis of survey data or specifi c training actions have been fi nanced in the context of other projects (e.g. budget support programmes). Overview of the Commission\u2019s statistical intervention in third countries, 1996\u20132005 ACP: African, Caribbean and Pacifi c Group of States. MEDA: Mediterranean members of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Tacis: Benefi ciary countries of the technical assistance programme for the Commonwealth of Independent States. The main conclusion of the report is that statistical pro- grammes and projects have been useful and that nearly all projects have yielded positive results. There is, for example, better coverage, reduction in delays and better dissemina- tion of statistics. There have also been improvements in the assimilation and adoption of international recommenda- tions and methodologies for statistics. These improvements are the result of the strengthening of the human resources \u2014 the number of statisticians involved in the projects \u2014 and the transfer of professional know-how to national and re- gional institutions and persons. The technical quality of interventions is also considered as having been good. The main improvements are observed in a few core statistical areas, also strongly supported by other donors, such as national accounts, consumer price indexes and government accounts. In other areas, such as in migra- tion, social indicators and trade statistics for example, the quality and comparability of data remain a major issue. how- ever, improvements of the data used for decision-making and policy formulation or monitoring of development poli- cies remains modest. The sustainability of the interventions in their three dimen- sions \u2014 human, fi nancial and technical resources, depends on their nature. It is not usually a main preoccupation for one-off statistical projects which are expected to produce specifi c results, e.g. a statistical publication. By contrast, larger-scale regional statistical programmes typically take several years to reach cruising speed as they involve national and regional actors with variable levels of statistical harmo- nisation. In those circumstances achieving sustainability can indeed take several subsequent project interventions. \u2018In summary, cooperation on statistical projects and pro- grammes has been a success, although there are obviously some weaknesses. The most important result is that the level of statistics is higher now than before, and that we are com- mitted to achieving further progress\u2019, says Mr Leemans.

        "M etagora is an international project under the OECD/ Paris21 initiative focusing on methods, tools and frameworks for measuring democracy, human rights and governance to enhance evidence-based assessments in these fields. The project was initially carried out from Febru- ary 2004 to February 2006 and prolonged, with a consolida- tion period from March to December 2006. Discussions are ongoing between donors and the project team on a possible second phase of the project, covering 2007\u201310. The European Community has supported the project with EUR 1 510 000 (67 % of the overall budget) through the European Initiative for Democracy and human Rights budget line. Decentralised laboratory of innovation The Metagora project team refers to itself as a decentral- ised laboratory for innovation ; it is policy-oriented in scope, multidisciplinary in approach, inclusive and participatory in method, bringing together statisticians, human rights activ- ists and public authorities. The originality of Metagora is its bottom-up approach to the development of indicators and related measurement methods in the field of democratic governance and human rights. Metagora partners all work with tools and methods that are designed for a particular is- sue in a particular context; however, through this project, the capacity of these tools to produce policy-relevant results is being assessed, and has thus provided lessons that can be applied in other situations elsewhere in the world. Metagora has, in close collaboration with its partners, col- lected and analysed information on how human rights and democratic governance can be measured using statistical tools. One component of the work has focused on method- ology, through experience gathered from different regions; from Mexico City where three pilot surveys looked into abuse and ill-treatment by police forces, to a project on the rights of indigenous peoples in the Philippines and a South African project on the implementation of land reform. National of- Metagora: successfully measuring governance and human rights It is a general belief that democratic governance and human rights are areas too abstract to measure and quantify, leaving progress and change in this field to subjective opinions and analysis. Recent work by the Metagora project has, however, proven that these areas can also be subject to objective and quantifiable measurement via statistical tools. Comparing strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to measuring human rights, governance and democracy is one of the main objectives of Metagora.

        "ficial statistical agencies have also been among the partners of Metagora through two regional multi-country surveys on democracy and governance issues implemented by national statistical institutes (NSIs) in eight capitals of francophone Africa and in three countries of the Andean Community. The project has also developed indicators and a database on the right to education in Palestine for example, and estab- lished a controlled vocabulary and harmonised procedures allowing local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to col- lect and analyse data on human rights violations in Sri Lanka. Metagora has also carried out a worldwide survey on projects measuring human rights and democratic governance and compiled the information collected in a database. Based on lessons learnt and collected experience from the various initiatives, Metagora has identified and produced training materials in the field of measuring human rights and demo- cratic governance. Measuring democracy and human rights An Independent Panel of Experts (IPE) was appointed in 2005 to review the reports emanating from the project and, upon request from donors, the IPE also produced a substan- tial assessment report based on an in-depth technical and scientific review of the project\u2019s pilot phase. Awaiting the final observations from the IPE, Metagora has already presented some preliminary lessons learnt. Metagora has proven that the preconceived view on the difficulties of measuring democracy and human rights was in-founded, and that in fact reliable and relevant statistical information on human rights and democratic governance can successfully be collected. This work has been supported by another conclusion: that people are often interested and willing to participate in monitoring and evaluation of human rights and democratic governance, contrary to the general belief that people were reluctant to participate due to fear of reprisals. This is an important observation, since monitor- ing of this area is facilitated by a bottom-up approach where local and national stakeholders participate to identify the relevant issues for that particular geographical area. NSIs and NGOs play an important role One objective of Metagora was to test how official statistical agencies can be involved in monitoring of human rights and democratic governance and the various cases have shown that NSIs can, in fact, play an important role. It can, for in- stance, result in increased legitimacy of the results and also improve the efficiency of the monitoring, due to the profes- sionalism and specific technical expertise in statistics that the NSI has. however, the potential question of bias and is- sues regarding ethics and protection of informants must be addressed and ensured. Last but not least, Metagora has also come to the conclusion that human rights institutions and NGOs can contribute to systematic and quantitative monitoring of human rights and democratic governance, rather than just following individual cases, which does not provide relevant information and data on the magnitude and trends in human rights and demo- cratic governance.

        "The European Union has undergone a number of enlargements since its creation. More and more countries have joined the first six Member States. The EU now has 27 Member States following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007. But the process is not finished. Regardless of the debate on the constitutional reform of the EU, the idea is that any European State which respects the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for hu- man rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law may apply to become a member of the Union. The mission of Directorate-General (DG) Enlargement is to take forward the process of enlargement of the European Union under the guidance of the Commissioner for Enlarge- ment. Currently DG Enlargement is carrying out a compre- hensive screening of Croatia and Turkey in order to take stock of the countries\u2019 alignment to the acquis communautaire . It is also responsible for the association stabilisation and acces- sion policy of the European Union. This aims at stabilising the western Balkan countries and promoting their associa- tion with the EU with a view to future accession. Last, but not least, DG Enlargement manages the Union\u2019s financial assist- ance to candidate and potential candidate countries and to new Member States during a transition period after acces- sion. This assistance supports the reform process as well as preparations for eventual membership. It focuses on institu- tion-building, alignment with the acquis communautaire and preparation for Community policies and instruments. Statistics indispensable for the enlargement process The importance of statistical data for these processes is para- mount. In the screening and negotiation process, proper sound, reliable and comprehensive statistical data are in- dispensable for measuring the candidate countries\u2019 align- ment to the acquis communautaire . Thanks to the tradition of statistical cooperation and to the early implementation of the acquis in the area, the provision of data for the required policy areas is usually possible. As far as the monitoring reports for the candidate, potential candidate and acceding countries are concerned, the sta- tistical annexes are an integral part of the report. Moreover the statistical data provide an important basis for the policy analysis of the other chapters. It goes without saying that the quality of the data is essen- tial. The accuracy and comparability of data is very impor- tant to come to the right conclusions. This is not only the case for membership, where for example government deficit and debt data are used for assessing if a country qualifies for membership in the euro zone. This is equally essential in the \u2018Investment in statistics contributes to successful enlargement\u2019 E nlargement is one of the EU\u2019s most powerful policy tools. The pull of the EU has helped to transform the countries of central and eastern Europe into mod- ern, well-functioning democracies. More recently, it has inspired far-reaching reforms in Turkey, Croatia and the western Balkans. All European citizens benefit from having neighbours that are stable democracies and prosperous market economies. Enlargement is a carefully managed process which helps the transformation of the countries involved, extending peace, stability, prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law across Europe. Bernd Wild, Task-Manager, Directorate-General for Enlargement in the European Commission. \u2018Experience shows that the biggest needs for statistical data arise from the areas of agriculture, social policy and demography, environment and economic and monetary policy\u2019, says Bernd Wild.

        "pre-accession context in order to evaluate if, for instance, the macroeconomic reforms are sufficiently implemented and a country will be able to stand the competitive pressures of membership. Experience shows that the biggest needs for statistical data arise from the areas of agriculture, social policy and demog- raphy, environment and economic and monetary policy. Rel- evant and recent data need to be available in a timely man- ner. DG Enlargement fully understands that it is difficult to provide recent and coherent data from countries which still have to build up a sound administrative capacity. however, sustainable activities in statistical cooperation should enable Eurostat to provide key data. DG Enlargement believes the statistical cooperation pro- grammes are beneficial since they help to build up capaci- ties in our partner countries and help to satisfy the data de- mands. The successful integration of the 10 new countries in 2004 into the European Union would also not have been pos- sible without the statistical data supporting all the areas of Commission policies. It is our firm belief that the investment in statistics also contributed to this successful integration. Cooperation with Eurostat services is usually constructive and efficient, be it in the context of the supply of statistical data or in the context of screening or technical adaptations for the accession treaty. Ad-hoc demands for data may be satis- fied through the various Eurostat databases available online, although the navigation may sometimes not be obvious. Targeted assistance As far as future support schemes for statistics are concerned the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) has replaced the three pre-accession instruments relevant for statistics, Phare, Cards and the Turkey instrument. IPA aims at providing targeted assistance to coun- tries which are candidate and potential candidate countries for membership in the EU. IPA has also been designed to better adapt to the different objectives and progress of each beneficiary concerned, so as to provide a targeted and effective support ac- cording to their needs and evolution. In particular, IPA will help to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law, reform public administration, carry out economic reforms, promote respect for human as well as minority rights and gen- der equality, support the development of civil society and advance regional cooperation, and contribute to sustainable development and poverty reduction. For candidate countries, the additional objective is the adoption and implementation of the full requirements for membership, whereas only approxi- mation to these requirements will be requested from potential candidate countries. The implementation of assistance under IPA is ensured through annual or multiannual programmes, as specified in the Commission regulation on implementation of the IPA. All programmes are designed following multiannual indicative planning documents, a three-year strategy docu- ment for each country, where the major areas of intervention and the main priorities are presented by the Commission. In view of the above we can conclude that statistics will continue to benefit from the pre-accession schemes just as enlargement will be able to profit from the continuous support of statistics.

        "In view of this problem, and as part of the re- gional integration assistance provided by Euro- pean cooperation, the EU\u2013CAN Project on Statistics \u2014 Andes- tad \u2014 is being implemented. It aims to use the European Union\u2019s experience to make the data collected from the different countries comparable. The project\u2019s objective is to improve the quality of the statistics that are used to effectively prepare, manage and evaluate government policies at national level. In order to bolster integration between the CAN countries, the EU aims to strengthen regional stability and boost trade integration. In other words, European cooperation is focus- ing on harmonised statistics to improve regional integration between the Andean countries. What is the EU\u2019s objective in supporting CAN integration? We should first note that relations between the EU and the CAN began just when the process of Andean integration was starting. The first agreement was signed in 1983 and, in De- cember 2003, as part of the cooperation in place between the two blocs, a political dialogue and cooperation agree- ment was signed, strengthening the links between the two regions by extending the agreement\u2019s remit to cover peace and security, democracy and governance, trade, economic and social development, migration, the environment and security. We should also bear in mind the following. 1. The European Union is the Andean Community\u2019s second largest trading partner. 2. In recent years, relations between the two blocs have intensified as a result of the new strategies, contexts and objectives that each side has brought to its political, economic and cooperation policies. 3. In particular, the two parties are currently involved in pre- liminary work for negotiations on an association agree- ment, which will represent a quantum leap in relations between the two regions. Regional cooperation with the CAN is managed by the European Commission delegation in Peru, since the head- The EU and the Andean Community: integration through harmonisation It is currently not possible to compare the official statistics between the member countries of the Andean Community (known as CAN, Comunidad Andina , a re- gional integration bloc comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), due mainly to the different methodologies and data collection methods. Therefore, given the lack of data comparability, it is hard to develop common policies in key areas such as employment, foreign trade or foreign investment.

        "quarters of the CAN Secretariat General are located in the Peruvian capital Lima. The European Commission delega- tion in Peru (specifically the Economic and Regional Co- operation Section, which has been in place since 2005) is responsible for identifying and formulating cooperation projects and contractually implementing financing agree- ments. The Andestad project The Andestad project aims to contribute to the process of strengthening the regional institutions of the Andean Com- munity by improving the quality of the statistics used to for- mulate national and Community policies. To this end, it is im- portant to have common statistics, which make it possible to harmonise economic policies and strengthen the common Andean market. At present, the project team is working with the bodies in- volved in the countries\u2019 national statistics programmes and with the Community Statistics Service run by the CAN Sec- retariat General. The project covers five major fields: insti- tutional support, foreign trade and transport statistics, na- tional accounts and macroeconomic statistics, business and territorial statistics, and poverty statistics. Accordingly, it will help provide a quantitative basis for decision-making and the drafting of policies to develop foreign trade and the so- cial, macroeconomic and business sectors in a coordinated way between the Andean countries. Following the European model The support provided by both Eurostat and EU experts is vital for CAN statistical harmonisation, ensuring a continu- ous flow of communication between the project and the European organisation. According to Eduardo Granados, Regional Director of the Andestad project, \u2018We are using Andean experts to carry out our work and are modelling our strategy on that used by Eurostat to harmonise its Com- munity statistics\u2019. The project\u2019s progress is shared with each national statisti- cal institute twice a year at meetings of the project\u2019s Advi- sory Committee. On these occasions, the directors of the institutes meet representatives from Eurostat, the European Commission delegation in Peru and some European experts to guarantee the institutional coordination needed to imple- ment the project, share experiences and work on statistical harmonisation. Harmonisation of methodology On the subject of methodology, Eduardo Granados says that \u2018With regard to harmonisation, we are starting on the basis that each national institute producing official statistics works in its own way to try to comply with international recom- Andestad covers five major fields: institutional support, foreign trade and transport statistics, national accounts and macroeconomic statistics, business and territorial statistics, and poverty statistics.

For instance, for employment statistics, the national methodologies follow International Labour Organisation recommendations, but, operationally, each country takes a different age as the minimum work- ing age. Consequently, data on unemployment are initially incomparable. The aim of the project, therefore, is to obtain harmonised statistics that allow us to make comparisons be- tween the countries and to produce aggregate indicators for the Community as a whole, while respecting each country\u2019s autonomy to produce its statistical data. We are not trying to impose working practices, but rather standardise them on the basis of consensus\u2019. In addition, Andestad is working with the national statis- tical institutes in key areas such as training and qualifica- tions for officials and the dissemination of information in the respective countries and at Community level. Mr Gra- nados is also pleased with the level of commitment shown by the member countries and their response to this joint EU\u2013CAN effort. Within a few years, with the support of common statistics, it will no longer be difficult for CAN countries to share strat- egies on key issues, and this will enable them to work in a more unified way and make further progress on the long road towards Andean integration.

        "Fifteen years of statistical cooperation in the Commonwealth of Independent States T oday the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) includes Armenia, Azer- baijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The Interstate Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS Statcommittee) was established in accordance with the decision of the heads of governments of the CIS in December 1991 for the coordination of activities of statistical services of the CIS countries, the development of a unified statistical methodology in compliance with international standards, securing the comparability of statistical data and rendering assistance to the CIS national statistical services. International workshop for the heads of the national statistical institutes in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). One important activity of the CIS Statcommittee is to collect and disseminate comparable social and economic indicators for the CIS countries. One important activity of the CIS Statcommittee consists of the collection and dissemina- tion of major social and economic statistical indicators of the CIS countries, which are comparable within the CIS region but also in a broader international context. This information is provided to the governments of the CIS coun- tries, including their statistical offices, to the CIS bodies, such as the Council of the heads of Governments of the CIS, the Economic Council, the Executive Committee of the CIS and others. It enables them to analyse the major results of socio- economic development, to assess the role of each country in the regional and world economy and to take decisions on the issues of economic cooperation among the CIS countries. The dissemination of data is carried out by publishing a considerable number of publications. Thus, for the period 1992\u20132006, the CIS Statcommittee released 140 statistical yearbooks and compendiums, 380 statistical bulletins and about 1 200 reports, press-releases and analytical notes. The data are also disseminated in electronic form with the major series being provided on the website of the CIS Statcommit- tee. For the above period, more than 4 400 copies of com- pact discs were issued. At present, the statistical database of the Committee includes 7 000 tables which contain 900 indi - cators. The CIS Statcommittee exchanges statistical publica- tions with international organisations and statistical services of many countries. 19 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 19 12-04-2007 12:16:00 ",
        "A wide cooperation with international organisations The transition of statistics of the CIS countries to international methodology and standards, meeting the requirements of a market economy, calls for systematic international coopera- tion by the CIS Statcommittee. International activities of the CIS Statcommittee are also necessary to render assistance to the CIS national statistical services in setting up their foreign relations with the leading international statistical organisa- tions responsible for the development of statistical stand- ards, as well as with statistical services of western countries with good experience in this work. In the period 1992\u20132006, the CIS Statcommittee carried out cooperation with statistical bodies of the following interna- tional organisations: the UN Statistics Division, the UNECE Statistical Division, the Unescap Statistics Division, the ILO Labour Statistics Bureau, the UNFPA, the FAO Statistics Divi- sion, the Development Economics Department of the World Bank, Eurostat, the Statistics Directorate of the OECD, the Statistical Department of the IMF, the Consortium Paris21 and the Permanent Office of the ISI. In the framework of this cooperation, the CIS Statcommit- tee participated jointly with international organisations in the projects executed by them in different fields of statis- tics, in the development of international methodological standards and recommendations on their implementation in practical activities of statistical services. Among such projects are the preparation of a manual on non-observed economy, the development of national systems of statisti- cal classifications, projects in the field of labour statistics, external trade and price statistics, environment and social statistics, recommendations for population and housing censuses. At present, the CIS Statcommittee plays jointly with Rosstat, the Russian federal statistical office, the coor- dinating role in the conduct of international comparisons of GDP and purchasing power parities of the CIS currencies for 2004\u201305 in the framework of a global round of the UN ICP (International Comparison Programme). In order to expand international cooperation, the CIS Stat- committee signed a memorandum of understanding with the Statistics Directorate of OECD in February 2002. The pur- pose of this memorandum is the cooperation in programmes of international comparisons, the implementation of SNA- 93, the improvement of methods of non-observed economy estimation, and the reconciliation and harmonisation of international classifications and nomenclatures. A similar memorandum of understanding was signed in March 2003 with the Consortium Paris21. In the framework of this memorandum, cooperation is carried out in the im- provement of methods of statistical data usage in the proc- ess of decision-making, improvement of methodological fundamentals of statistics, methods of collection, processing and dissemination of statistical information, and methods of statistical systems management. In December 2003, the CIS Statcommittee and the State Com- mittee of the Russian Federation on Statistics signed a memo- randum of understanding with the World Bank on the man- agement and conduct of an international comparison pro- gramme in the CIS region for 2003\u201306. Apart from that, the CIS Statcommittee signed an agreement with the US Census Bureau on mutual exchange of statistical publications. A key methodological role Methodological activities of the CIS Statcommittee, closely connected with international cooperation, made it possible to prepare more than 500 methodological documents, rec- ommendations and instructions on the basis of about 200 documents of international statistical organisations, which contributed considerably to the transition of the CIS statisti- cal services to international standards. For example, some of the prepared documents were intended to facilitate the introduction of SNA-93 into regular statistical practices of the CIS countries and the adaptation of the system to peculi- arities in the organisation of economy and statistics in these countries. Based on the recommendations for population and housing censuses, the CIS Statcommitee started preparing the 2010 round of the censuses in the CIS countries. For this purpose the Coordinating Council for Population Censuses, which operates under the auspices of the CIS Statcommittee, was established. The transition of statistics of the CIS countries to international methodology and standards calls for systematic international cooperation of the CIS Statcommittee.

        "Taking into account the fact that the main decisions on methodological materials being developed are taken at the meetings and conferences of statistical bodies of the United Nations and other international organisations, the partici- pation of the CIS Statcommittee in these is very important. The CIS Statcommittee is an official observer in the UN Statistical Commission, the UNECE Conference of European Statisticians and its Bureau, and the Unescap Subcommittee on Statistics, and is the member of the Committee for the Co- ordination of Statistical Activities (previously \u2013 the UN ACC Subcommittee on Statistical Activities). Apart from that, in the framework of cooperation in the field of statistics with the European Union, the OECD, the World Bank, the IMF, the ILO and the Paris21 Consortium, the spe- cialists of the CIS Statcommittee participated in 130 meet- ings of the working groups, seminars and study courses con- ducted by these international organisations on the following questions: national accounts, labour statistics, external trade, prices, agriculture, environment and social statistics, infor- mation systems, population and housing censuses, interna- tional economic classifications, dissemination of statistical information, international comparisons of GDP and others. 700 consultations to the CIS statistical institutes Of great importance is the consultative methodological as- sistance rendered by the CIS Statcommittee to the specialists of the CIS statistical services on the questions of statistical observation organisation, conduct of household surveys, the development of national classification systems and their in- troduction into statistical practice. In the period 1992\u20132006, the CIS Statcommittee organised more than 700 consulta- tions for the specialists of the CIS statistical services. An important aspect of statistical cooperation with interna- tional organisations and national statistical services of west- ern countries was the conduct of methodological seminars and study courses for the specialists of the CIS countries with financial support from the international organisations. Seminars and study courses were organised by the CIS Stat- committee jointly with such international organisations as Eurostat, (in the framework of the TACIS programme), the World Bank, IMF, ILO, UNFPA, UNDP, UNECE, Unescap and the Paris21 Consortium. Technical assistance in the conduct of the seminars was ren- dered as well by the statistical services of Germany, the Neth- erlands, the United Kingdom, France and a number of other western countries. For the period 1992\u20132006, as a whole, 60 international seminars, meetings and study courses with a total amount of about 2 600 participants were conducted. During the same period, the CIS Statcommittee received 390 foreign delegations from international organisations and western countries and sent more than 250 specialists on a mission to these organisations and countries, mainly at the expense of the Tacis programme and programmes of the World Bank, IMF and UNFPA.

        "EU\u2013EFTA: united means stronger! The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is an intergovernmen- tal organisation for the promotion of free trade and economic integration to benefit its four Member States: Iceland, Liechten- stein, Norway and Switzerland. Since the beginning of the 1990s, EFTA has progres- sively developed a statistical cooperation policy with the EU Member States and Eurostat.

Photo: Christine Ardillac E FTA was established in 1960 in response to the Euro- pean Economic Community and is one of the world\u2019s largest free trade networks, having relations with more than 50 countries and territories. The Association is responsible for the management of: \u00b7 the EFTA Convention, which forms the legal basis of the organisation and governs free trade relations between the EFTA States; \u00b7 EFTA\u2019s worldwide network of free trade and partnership agreements; \u00b7 the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement, which enables three of the four EFTA Member States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to fully participate in the EU\u2019s internal market. EEA statistical cooperation The European Economic Area (EEA) unites the 27 EU Member States and the three EEA EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) into an internal market governed by the same basic rules. These rules aim to enable goods, services, capital and persons to move freely about the EEA in an open and competitive environment, a concept referred to as the four freedoms. The purpose of the statistical cooperation within the frame- work of the European Economic Area is to develop an inte- grated European statistical system (ESS) which can give co- herent descriptions of all fields of cooperation covered by the EEA Treaty. This statistical system should also be able to 22 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 22 20-04-2007 10:52:48 ",
        "describe the effects of this European integration process on different economical, social and environmental aspects. More concretely, the aim of the EEA statistical cooperation is to transmit statistical information from EEA EFTA States to Eurostat for storage, processing and dissemination. The legal bases for cooperation in the field of statistics under the EEA Agreement are Article 76 and Protocol 30. Annex XXI to the agreement contains common rules ( acquis commun- autaire ) on statistics that are binding for both contracting parties (EU and EEA EFTA). EEA EFTA States are members of the European statistical system and therefore their experts fully participate, with- out the right to vote, in all committees, working groups and other bodies which assist Eurostat in the management and development of statistical programmes and actions. This so-called \u2018policy-shaping\u2019 process allows EEA EFTA experts to contribute to the shaping of EU legislation at its drafting phase by the European Commission. It is also important to emphasise that, except in comitology procedure, there is no formal voting and that in any case EEA EFTA States can ex- press their opinion. In counterpart, EEA EFTA States contribute financially to the European statistical programme and defray the additional costs incurred by Eurostat for storing, processing and dissem- inating their data. An additional contribution in kind consists of four experts seconded to Eurostat. These secondments are important since they secure the transfer of knowledge and promote integration of the European statistical system. Eurostat continuously expresses their interest in maintaining this high level of EFTA expert involvement. The institutional set-up of EFTA statistical cooperation is somewhat complex since Switzerland is not part of the EEA. Nevertheless, from 1 January 2007, a bilateral agreement be- tween Switzerland and the EU governs the statistical coop- eration between both parties. This agreement ensures the full participation of Switzerland in the European statistical system and the publication of Swiss data in all Eurostat dissemina- tion tools as the EEA agreement in the field of statistics for the other EFTA States. EU\u2013EFTA statistical cooperation with third countries The aim of technical assistance in the field of statistics is to provide international organisations, national decision mak- ers, and other stakeholders with reliable tools for the moni- toring of the economic and social transition process. In the medium term, the production and dissemination of compa- rable statistics within a broad Europe, including the Mediter- ranean area, will contribute to the economic prosperity and the political stability of the region. Thus, EFTA and the European Union have a common inter- est in assisting countries neighbouring the enlarged Euro- pean Economic Area to develop their statistical capacity and to harmonise statistical methods and standards with European norms. In January 2005, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on technical cooperation in the field of statistics between the EFTA Secretariat and Eurostat came into force. The MoU\u2019s overall objective is to avoid gaps or overlapping in technical assistance toward countries where the European Union is also active, through direct involvement of the four EFTA States in statistical programmes run by the European Commission. The MoU, which covers a three-year period (2005\u201307), in- volves EFTA funds totalling EUR 1.74 million and two national experts seconded to Eurostat as part of this contribution, to ensure continuity of support and EFTA visibility in the overall programming and management of EU\u2013EFTA actions. EFTA\u2019s involvement in technical cooperation programmes under the MoU gives priority to countries that have con- cluded declarations on cooperation or free trade agree- ments with EFTA. Support is mainly granted to developing countries and economies in transition in the western Balkans (Cards), Mediterranean regions (Medstat) but also to recent and prospective partner countries to the eastern boundary of the enlarged EU (Tacis). It is important to emphasise that in spite of the relatively modest amounts allocated by EFTA for statistical coopera- tion compared to the European Commission, the relatively flexible EFTA procedures make it possible for EFTA NSIs to obtain strong visibility towards the ESS as towards recipient countries. EFTA contribution to the European statistical training programme For maintaining a high level of competence and ensuring data consistency throughout the European statistical system (ESS), statisticians require continuous training in new meth- ods, new techniques and best practices. EFTA is actively in- volved in the planning and the implementation of the Euro- Liechtenstein\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Klaus Tsch\u00fctscher greets Gabriel Gamez, EFTA Statistical Adviser, when the European statistical institutes received the code of practice.

        "pean statistical training programme through a \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019 with Eurostat. In order to secure the full participation of EFTA statisticians in the ESTP, two courses were financed by EFTA in 2005. These were organised by Statistics Norway and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, on business registers and on advanced sam- pling techniques. In total, more than 50 statisticians from EFTA States and EU Member States participated in these courses. In return, EFTA statisticians were allowed to participate in all ESTP courses organised by Eurostat and EU Member States. The same arrangement has been concluded from 2006 onwards. For 2006, EFTA NSIs have committed funds for the organisation of the three following courses: \u00b7 Data analysis and data modelling, Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzer- land, 18\u201322 September 2006; \u00b7 Use of administrative registers in production of statistics, Oslo, Norway, 2\u20135 October 2006; \u00b7 User-friendly dissemination of official statistics on the In- ternet, Oslo, Norway, 7\u201310 November 2006. EFTA Statistical Adviser\u2019s Office in Luxembourg The EFTA Statistical Adviser\u2019s Office (EFTA SAO) was created as a liaison office between Eurostat and the EFTA national statistical institutes. EFTA SAO\u2019s main objective is to sustain the integration of the EFTA States in the evolving European statistical system, and thus to provide harmonised and com- parable statistics supporting the general cooperation proc- ess between EFTA and the EU within and outside the EEA Agreement. EFTA SAO consists of five people: the Statistical Adviser and his deputy, two secretaries and a trainee. EFTA SAO is responsible, inter alia, for the following tasks. \u00b7 Follow-up and implementation of the procedures for the incorporation of EC statistical acts into the Annex XXI to the EEA Treaty. New EC legal acts relevant for the EEA are then formally included in Annex XXI after adoption by the EEA Joint Committee. The Joint Committee, which generally meets once a month, is made up of ambassadors of the EEA EFTA States and representatives from the European Commission. \u00b7 Contribution to the development of the EEA statistical programme. The EEA statistical programme is a subset of the EC statistical programme and is revised annually. \u00b7 Support of the production and dissemination of EEA statistics (via Eurostat). This also includes a yearly assess- ment of the inclusion of EFTA data in Eurostat publica- tions and databases.

The fact that EFTA SAO is located in Eurostat premises in Luxembourg proves that the EU\u2013EFTA statis- tical cooperation is a success story. By Gabriel Gamez, EFTA Statistical Adviser.

        "Paris21: improving data for the millennium review The Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century, Paris21, was launched in 1999 in response to a United Nations Eco- nomic and Social Council resolution on rationalising and improv- ing statistics and indicators. The main objective for the initiative is to develop a culture of transparent, evidence-based policymaking and implementation which serves to im- prove governance and government effectiveness in reducing poverty and achieving the millennium development goals. The partnership helps to achieve this by stimulat- ing greater demand, availability and use of better statistics and statistical analysis in national, international and civil society decision-making. Participants in a workshop on national strategies for the development of statistics (NSDS) for the French- speaking countries in central Africa, Mali, February 2005. Photo: Paris21 O ver the years, the focus on results-based management and on improved delivery and impact of aid has in- creased. National policymakers and the international development community have become increasingly aware that strengthening statistical capacity is essential to support the design, monitoring, and evaluation of national develop- ment plans, such as poverty reduction and sector strategies, and the millennium development goals (MDGs). In recogni- tion of this reliance on good, timely statistics, the Second In- ternational Round Table on Managing for Development Re- sults in 2004 issued the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS), which encourages, inter alia, all developing countries to design and implement a national strategy for the develop- ment of statistics (NSDS). Building statistical capacity An NSDS is a strategy for strengthening statistical capacity across the entire national statistical system (NSS). The NSDS provides a vision for where the NSS should be in 5\u201310 years\u2018 time and sets milestones for getting there. It provides a robust framework and action plan for building the statistical capacity to meet both current and future data needs. In particular, the aim is to align statistical development with wider poverty- focused national development programmes and strategies. The NSDS approach has been developed in response to the constraints and issues that countries have faced during the last years. It builds on the results of past experiences both in developing countries and in more advanced countries. 25 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 25 12-04-2007 12:16:13 ",
        "Starting in 2004, Paris21 has co-organised nearly 20 regional workshops on designing NSDSs in the Arab States, Asia, Cen- tral America, and sub-Saharan Africa regions. And in collabo- ration with several regional and international partners, Par- is21 co-launched a reference regional strategic framework for statistical development in Africa, whose overall objective was to formulate a regional strategy for guiding future statis- tical capacity building activities on the continent. Supporting statistical development Paris21 has focused its efforts on assisting low-income coun- tries to design, implement, and monitor an NSDS in order to have, among other things, better statistics for national and international use by the time of the next millennium review in 2010. Paris21 supports country NSDS teams primarily through the following types of activities. \u00b7 Development of NSDS methodology: Paris21 offers methodological advice and documentation, targeting different audiences and purposes. Examples include a guide to designing an NSDS, a guide to developing a pol- icy-based NSDS and a paper exploring issues in design and implementation planning. All these documents can be downloaded from the online NSDS knowledge base. \u00b7 Advocacy and the development of statistical advocacy tools: the advocacy tools are designed to assist countries and donor institutions to make the case for increased support to statistics and for adopting a strategic ap- proach to statistical development. Recently developed tools include two statistical advocacy films featuring interviews with the Presidents of Mali and Senegal and African statisticians, a scholarly paper entitled \u2018Measur- ing up to the measurement problem\u2019 that has spawned a series of pamphlets and leaflets, and a \u2018Frequently asked questions on NSDS\u2019 flier. \u00b7 Implementation of regional programmes: the main com- ponents of Paris21\u2019s regional programmes include (a) es- tablishing baseline assessments; (b) organising regional events; (c) undertaking regional advocacy efforts to gar- ner political support for the design and implementation of NSDS; (d) consolidating partner efforts at the national level; (e) mobilising technical and financial support for the design and implementation of NSDS; and (f) report- ing on progress made. \u00b7 Promotion of partnership and donor collaboration: Par- is21 encourages and facilitates information sharing and aid harmonisation among donors. Examples include its light reporting exercise (LRE) and the co-organisation of two Forums on African Statistical Development, which brought together statistical directors from all African countries as well as all technical and financial partners supporting African statistics. Bringing the right partners together Among Paris21\u2019s greatest strengths is its ability to bring to the table a wide range of technical and financial partners sup- porting statistical development. Its efforts in promoting part- nership and collaboration have yielded many crucial results. In early 2006, and in collaboration with international and re- gional partners, Paris21 produced a worldwide report on the status of NSDS preparation in developing countries. The pur- pose was to identify and monitor \u2014 for NSDS country teams, national policymakers, bilateral donors, regional and inter- national institutions, and all other development partners \u2014 where countries currently stand in their strategic statistical planning and what remains to be done if NSDS targets are to be achieved. The report found that, of the 105 countries considered, 34 had statistical strategies in place, 54 were at various stages in pre- paring strategies, while 17 countries neither had strategies in place nor had started to design one, though a number of these had expressed their intention to do so. It should be noted that some countries with existing strategies also intend to update and develop them, following the NSDS approach. The goals of the NSDS progress report complement those of the LRE, whose specific objectives were to increase knowl- edge on what development partners are doing to support statistical capacity building in sub-Saharan Africa, provide information to improve donor harmonisation and collabora- tion in the statistical area, and identify countries or statistical Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21 St Century Partenariat statistique au service du d\u00e9veloppement au XXI e si\u00e8cle OUR MISSION Toboost the use of statistics in decision making.

        "areas where additional support is needed. The UN Commit- tee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities has recently agreed to the creation of an inter-agency task team whose function will be to harmonise the LRE with similar, existing reporting systems; develop an online database for its results that meets the requirements of different partners; and over- see the initiative\u2019s updating and expansion. Tangible results Paris21\u2019s partnership and donor collaboration activities \u2014 including the NSDS report and LRE \u2014 have led to positive, concrete action. Regular videoconference meetings between the African Development Bank, Afristat, Eurostat, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Paris21, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the World Bank, and other partners have been organised to coordinate support to African coun- try NSDS processes. The gaps in support to African countries that were highlighted in the NSDS and LRE reports have also incited partners to mobilise significant technical and finan- cial support. The African Development Bank has now fully adopted and mainstreamed NSDS into its statistical activi- ties. Paris21 and the IMF have conducted joint missions to assist African countries to integrate NSDS into poverty re- duction strategy processes and to comply with general data dissemination system practices. The World Bank\u2019s Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) has been reoriented toward supporting NSDSs and aligned more closely with the results agenda and MAPS. The fund expects to finance the design of more than 30 NSDSs over the next three years. Overcoming obstacles and paving the way forward The LRE report identified several issues as hindering devel- opment partner efforts to deliver their support to statistical capacity building. These included insufficient donor collabo- ration and a shortage of qualified experts to provide techni- cal assistance. To address these and other issues, Paris21, at the Third Inter- national Round Table on Managing for Development Results held in Vietnam in February, discussed what is working and what is not working in building statistical capacity, outlining the types and forms of technical and financial assistance, ex- periences of beneficiary countries in receiving this support, and summaries of case studies on the delivery of aid. The intention will be to propose next steps \u2014 a follow-up to the MAPS \u2014 on applying the Paris Declaration on Aid Effective- ness to statistics and scaling-up technical and financial sup- port to developing countries\u2019 national statistical systems.

        "The UN: assisting countries to monitor development The availability of good statistics and the capacity of governments, donors and international organisations to measure, monitor and report systematically on progress in all policy areas lies at the heart of development policy and the achievement of the millennium development goals. Scaling-up of national statistical services is necessary to produce data for monitoring measurable outcomes. The essence is that good policies, based on empirical evidence and a clear understanding of the development process, lead to improved outcomes consistent with national priorities and objectives. The millennium development goals (MDGs) provided a unique opportunity to raise awareness that a sound quantitative knowledge of progress and gaps is an important element in reaching the final goals set by the Millennium Declara- tion, as well as the other internationally agreed develop- ment goals. The monitoring requirements, however, have also clearly uncovered significant shortcomings in the avail- ability and use of data to monitor development efforts. Pro- ducing the necessary data and reaching all target groups of users with adequate tools, especially in countries where resources are limited, is a significant challenge. The current situation of statistical services constrains the effectiveness and achievement of national development planning and policy in many countries. Periodic assessment of MDGs Since the periodic assessment of progress towards the MDGs began over five years ago, a number of initiatives have been launched to address the needs of developing countries to strengthen their statistical capacity to produce, analyse and disseminate data. A major step in this direction was in 2004, with the endorsement of the Marrakech Action Plan for Sta- tistics \u2014 Better Data for Better Results, an Action Plan for Improving Development Statistics, by the Second Interna- tional Round Table on Managing for Development Results, comprising aid recipients and donor stakeholders. In line with the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics, the Inter- agency and Expert Group (IAEG) on MDG Indicators \u2014 re- sponsible for the preparation of data and analysis to monitor global trends in MDGs and coordinated by the UN Statistics Division \u2014 has also made statistical capacity one of its prior- ity areas of work and has been working to define priorities and provide recommendations for actions to be undertaken at both the national and the international levels. Interna- tional agencies, donors and representatives from national statistical offices have worked together to identify national priorities in capacity building and to make specific recom- mendations for the improvement of the delivery and coordi- nation of statistical assistance to countries. More recently, the United Nations Statistical Commission, comprising representatives of national statistical services, has also called the attention of Member States to the urgent need to build statistical capacity in countries where resourc- es are limited. A resolution on statistical capacity building was proposed by the Commission in March 2006 and later approved by the Economic and Social Council in July 2006. UNSD in statistical capacity building The statistical capacity building programme of the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) is an integral part of the division\u2019s work programme and is closely intertwined to the division\u2019s work on international standard setting. The links across the three main elements of the UNSD statistical programme \u2014 normative, analytical and operational \u2014 fa- cilitate the efficient transfer of international standards and practices to countries that need assistance in developing their statistical system. The principles guiding the technical cooperation programme of the Division are that technical cooperation activities should be demand-driven, responsive to local conditions, nationally controlled and well coordinated. Improving coordination between partners on the agenda The improvement of the coordination of development coop- eration work among international partners has become cru- cial to ensure the effective delivery of technical assistance. The UNSD is mandated by the Statistical Commission to as- sist in donor coordination in statistical capacity activities. The division has recently explored new formats for coordinating \u00a9 EC /EChO / O. Minichetti 28 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 28 12-04-2007 12:16:16 ",
        "work and establishing cooperation with other partners. One example is the recently launched project in the southern Af- rican region, where the steering committee responsible for setting the structure and monitoring the implementation of the project also includes \u2014 besides national chief statisti- cians \u2014 international agencies and donors. This would allow the various stakeholders to benefit from each other\u2019s ongo- ing activities, avoiding duplication and helping countries to integrate the various components of the project into their overall national statistical development strategies. The Division works in close partnership with a number of partners, including among others the DevInfo Development Group, the World Bank, UNFPA, UNDP and bilateral donors such as the UK Department for International Development and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. The UN Statistics Division has also focused on improving south\u2013south collaboration and building networks of statisti- cians in regions and sub-regions. This has been the approach adopted in the regional and sub-regional projects conduct- ed by the Division, all relying on existing regional and sub- regional organisations and networks, in an effort to create strong communities of statisticians who can draw on each other\u2019s strengths and achievements. Assisting with experts, training and data dissemination The Division draws on its technical expertise to provide support to countries in all areas covered by its regular work programme \u2014 economic statistics, social and demographic statistics, trade statistics, environment statistics, gender sta- tistics, data and metadata dissemination and exchange. It provides advisory services to national statistical offices to help them develop their statistical system, recommending steps to deal with their organisational structure, legislative framework and required resources. The Division also assists countries through training, advisory services and region- al and sub-regional projects aiming at strengthening the capacity of national statisti- cal offices and improving south\u2013south and intra-regional cooperation. There are cur- rently two projects being conducted in the Economic Com- munity of West African States (Ecowas) and the Southern Af- rica Development Community (SADC) regions, both aiming at strengthening statistical capacity building in support to the MDGs. Similar new projects, also aimed at the improvement of data for monitoring the MDGs and structured around sub- regional organisations, are in the pipeline. The Division\u2019s handbooks and guidelines, developed on the basis of intergovernmental recommendations and agree- ments, are widely used as training tools in national and re- gional programmes and by statisticians in countries in the de- velopment of their data collection programmes. The Division has issued 25 new handbooks and manuals since 2000. An important component of the Division\u2019s programme fo- cuses on enhancing the data dissemination infrastructure of national statistics systems in an effort to improve the use of data for evidence-based policy design and evaluation among users of official statistics, especially millennium development goal statistics and indicators. As part of this, the Division col- laborates with the DevInfo group to support Member States in the use of common database systems and platforms for tracking national human development indicators. MDGInfo, an adaptation of DevInfo, a technology specifically designed to support governments in MDG monitoring, has been issued for two consecutive years, in 2005 and 2006. Technical assistance is delivered by UNSD through the fol- lowing. \u00b7 Interregional advisers: senior statisticians with expertise in high-demand areas, who provide countries with tech- nical advice upon request.

        "\u00b7 Training workshops: workshops, usually with a regional focus and implemented in close cooperation with the Re- gional Commissions and other regional and subregional organisations. Each workshop is dedicated to one specific statistical subject matter from the broad spectrum of the Division\u2019s technical expertise (census taking, social statis- tics, MDG indicators, national accounts, environmental accounts, industry statistics, energy statistics, environ- mental statistics, trade statistics, classifications, statistical organisation, etc). Being part of the global statistical community \u2014 one benefit Member States who have worked with UNSD as partners in technical cooperation programmes have consistently pro- vided positive feedback, pointing to measurable impacts on national and sub-regional statistical programmes. One frequently quoted result is that cooperation with the Divi- sion instills in national statistical systems a sense of being part of the larger global statistical community. In particular, the development account projects \u2014 a funding mechanism provided by the General Assembly \u2014 have created strong sub-regional networks of statisticians, at the management as well as the working level. Further evidence of the tangible impact of Division projects is the adoption and use by many countries of international recommendations and standards. This is true both as regards the overall organisation of statis- tical systems \u2014 countries have applied UNSD recommenda- tions in the restructuring of their national statistical systems \u2014 and for the implementation of recommendations in spe- cific statistical fields. There remain, however, a number of challenges for the Di- vision to be able to deliver its assistance effectively and for countries to fully benefit from existing initiatives. First, part- ners still have a long way to go to improve their coordination mechanisms and to increase the number of opportunities for full cooperation in jointly-developed programmes. Initia- tives by international agencies and donors should be built around the existing statistical national strategies and master plans and always be in accordance with the plans. Also, in order for capacity building activities to be sustainable, most national statistical initiatives should be covered by national budgets and supported by a strong political commitment. Coordination also needs to be improved within countries \u2014 between all agencies producing statistics and the National Statistical Office, with the latter being established as a fully independent institution and with a clear mandate for the collection, processing and dissemination of official statistics. This in turn, would also facilitate coordination of internation- al partners who normally deal with different counterparts \u2014 from national statistical offices to different line ministries. Finally, the donor community needs to recognise that al- though statistics are increasingly recognised as an indispen- sable tool for development, resources devoted to statistics are still relatively poor as compared to funds devoted to other development initiatives.

        "The World Bank: improving statistical capacity The World Bank is an international development agency, working to reduce poverty by financing projects and programmes, advising countries, and facilitating knowledge development. The World Bank\u2019s concern with statistical data stems from the need to get better results from development activities, to measure success and target resources efficiently. But many national statistical systems are inadequate for these purposes. In Afri- ca, for instance, barely half of all residents have been enumer- ated in a population census in the last 10 years. Yet censuses are often the only source of data on the geographical distri- bution and the age and gender structure of the population. The World Bank\u2019s priority is to help countries improve their capacity to produce and use official statistics. Countries need better data to manage for development results, and they also need to provide data required by the international development community. Following discussions at a major international conference, the Second Round Table on Man- aging for Results held in Morocco in February 2004, statisti- cians and development practitioners agreed on a global ac- tion plan known as the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics, or MAPS for short. An action plan for statistics The key approach of MAPS is the preparation and implemen- tation of national strategies for the development of statistics. These assess weaknesses in statistical systems and develop plans for improvement which are closely aligned with the needs of data users and national development processes. Significant funding from donor agencies and governments is needed to improve statistical capacity, and these develop- ment strategies provide the means to put forward options and to show the effectiveness of better statistics. MAPS also includes other objectives. It aims for full participa- tion in the next global census round in 2010. It also aims to improve international household survey programmes and to ensure that countries have more sustainable household sur- vey programmes. And it aims to make short-term improve- ments in the availability of key indicators such as those used in poverty reduction strategies and for monitoring the mil- lennium development goals (MDG). The action plan can only be carried out through an interna- tional partnership of statistical practitioners and the devel- opment community. For instance, Paris21 (the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century, housed in OECD) provides an important focal point for advocacy and guidance on developing strategies for improving statisti- cal systems. Several bilateral and multilateral partners have supported the costs of strategy preparation in countries, in- Africa Development Indicators 2006 confirm that things are changing in new and unexpected ways. Growth rates over the last 10 years have caught up and, in fact, exceed those in developing countries. Photo: World Bank / Arne hoel 31 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 31 12-04-2007 12:16:42 ",
        "cluding grants through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) administered by the World Bank. Implementation of national strategies for the development of statistics needs investment by governments and support from development partners. The World Bank has designed a specifi c lending programme \u2014 called Statcap \u2014 to provide countries with fi nancial resources for this purpose. Since the fi rst two projects were approved for Ukraine (USD 32 mil- lion) and Burkina Faso (USD 10 million), Nigeria has used the approach within a larger programme (USD 15.6 million of a USD 140 million economic reform project), and Tajikistan has obtained a credit of USD 1 million. In many cases there are co-fi nancing arrangements with other donors. Projects are being developed in other countries, including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, and Sri Lanka. Another element of MAPS \u2014 improving household survey programmes \u2014 is being addressed through the creation of the International household Survey Network (IhSN) in late 2004. The network has compiled documentation on over 2 700 household surveys. Plans for future surveys by interna- tional agencies are being monitored and will be published in a system which will show these plans on a country-by-coun- try basis. Making better use of data Improving capacity to collect and produce statistics is impor- tant, but statistics have no value unless they are used and are accessible to users. An important part of the strategy to im- prove statistical capacity is to make better use of data from household surveys and administrative records. The IhSN has made good progress in improving access to household sur- vey datasets. A major achievement has been the creation of the Microdata Management Toolkit, which provides a simple method for documenting and disseminating survey data ac- cording to international standards and best practices. Work is also being done to help statistics producers preserve ano- nymity of respondents and to respect confi dentiality con- cerns, by providing tools and best practice methods. These initiatives have been welcomed by many countries, particu- larly those with limited capacity and experience in this area. Partners have also been working to improve access to data, and to make better use of those data to improve estimates of key indicators. A good example is the work done by Unicef and UNDP to develop a software tool, Devinfo, to help countries collate and disseminate estimates of key indicators to a wide audience. Many countries have used this system, and Malawi and Tanzania have piloted a version which uses the web. UNDP has complemented this support with a large-scale \u2018statistical literacy\u2019 training programme on the use and interpretation of the indicators used to assess progress to the MDGs. Accelerating data improvements Data quality and availability improvements often take time in statistical capacity improvement programmes, because institutional change and development is needed. So a pro- gramme for accelerating data improvements in pilot coun- tries has been launched recently to support MAPS. This ac- celerated data programme is focused on household surveys and censuses, because these sources provide estimates for many social indicators. In developing countries \u2014 where ad- ministrative systems may be weak \u2014 they often provide the quickest and most effi cient way of getting key statistics and of measuring the impact of development on people\u2019s lives. The approach used is determined by country circumstances. In some cases, improvements result from better use of exist- ing data, and in others new or modifi ed survey programmes are needed. In all cases the fi rst step is a comprehensive in- ventory of data sources. The second step is an assessment of data quality and timeliness. Third, and only where appropri- ate, an improved data collection eff ort based on a continu- ous household survey programme is designed in partner- ship with the national statistical authorities. Looking ahead Among international partners the World Bank has an impor- tant role, through advocacy and through fi nancial instru- ments such as the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, the Statcap multi-country lending programme and grants for development partners. Our view is that the statistical capacity of the developing countries is improving to meet new demands for offi cial sta- tistics at national and international levels. This results from eff orts of countries and the international community. But this progress needs to be accelerated. The Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics will continue to provide the framework for the World Bank\u2019s programme, and, in the short to medium term, the accelerated data programme is a practical and workable solution to accelerate improvements in key data areas. The programme is important for Africa, where improvements are most urgently needed, are most diffi cult to make, yet potentially provide the largest returns.

        "A prime example of international statistical cooperation: purchasing power parities In their simplest form, purchasing power parities (PPPs) are nothing more than price relatives that show the ratio of the prices in national currencies of the same good or service in different countries. For example, if the price of a hamburger in France is USD 2.84 and in the United States is USD 2.20, the PPP for ham- burgers between France and the United States is USD 2.84 to USD 2.20 or 1.29 euros to the dollar. In other words, for every dollar spent on hamburgers in the United States, USD 1.29 would have to be spent in France in order to obtain the same quantity and quality \u2013 or volume \u2013 of hamburgers. PPPs are still price relatives when they refer to a product group or to an aggregate or to GDP. The PPP team in Eurostat. Silke Stapel, Michael Geothals and Isabella Ben Charrada on the first row and Pille Paloj\u00e4rv, Paul Konijn, Carlos Diaz Muriel, Jarko Pasanen and Sebastian Reinecke on the second row. Photo: Christine Ardillac P urchasing power parities are of interest to an increas- ing number of international and national users. Inter- national organisations, government agencies, universi- ties and research institutes use PPPs as inputs into economic research and policy analysis requiring comparisons between countries. PPPs are employed as currency converters to generate volume measures with which to compare levels of economic performance, economic welfare, consumption, in- vestment, overall productivity and government expenditure on defence, health, etc. They are also used as price measures to compare price levels, price structures, price convergence and competitiveness. Increasingly, PPPs are also employed for poverty analysis. PPPs are statistical indicators which would not exist without international statistical cooperation. Because of their very 33 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 33 12-04-2007 12:16:53 ",
        "nature as multilateral spatial price differentials, no single national statistical institute could establish them on its own. The matrix can only be established when the numerous in- put data of all countries, stemming from various price statis- tics and the national accounts, are combined by a supra-na- tional statistical body. In the European Union, PPPs have particular importance for monitoring economic policies and administration. Some 30 % of the total EU budget is spent on the Structural and Cohe- sion Funds, the overall aim of which is to reduce economic disparities gradually between and within EU Member States. The allocation of the bulk of the funds is made on the basis of PPP-converted regional GDP per capita. PPPs are also used to determine the correction coefficients for EU officials\u2019 salaries stationed outside Brussels and Luxembourg and for pensions. Origins from the 1950s The origins of international price and volume comparisons of GDP can be traced back to the experimental comparisons carried out by the Organisation for European Economic Co- operation (OEEC) \u2014 the forerunner of OECD \u2014 in the 1950s. Initially, it covered France, Germany, Italy, the United King- dom and the United States. Subsequently, it was expanded to include Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. Relying on the OEEC experiences the International Compari- son Project (ICP) was launched in the late 1960s. It started as a research project, but its ultimate goal was to set up worldwide PPP-based comparisons of GDP on a regular basis. The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the University of Penn- sylvania shared the responsibility for the project with the latter taking the leading role. The project\u2019s initial task was to develop a methodology which would serve as a comprehensive system of international comparisons based on PPPs. The next task was to test the methodology by making actual comparisons using PPPs. Thus, the first three phases of the ICP \u2014 1970, 1973 and 1975 \u2014 were essentially experimental in character. After Phase III, there were three major developments. Firstly, the ICP became a regular part of the work programme of the UNSD with the University of Pennsylvania advising on methodological issues. Secondly, Eurostat started to play an increasingly important role, organising the comparisons for the EU, providing technical and financial assistance to re- gional comparisons in Africa and encouraging the OECD to become involved in the work. The third and most significant development was the regionalisation of the ICP. New ICP round in 2005 Two phases of the ICP were completed after regionalisation, which covered 60 and 64 countries, respectively. Phase VI, covering 83 countries and having 1993 as the reference year, was started but not completed. After Phase VI failed to make a world comparison, an evaluation report was produced by a consultant contracted by the United Nations Statistical Com- mission (UNSC) was completed. It found that PPPs and PPP- related statistics are needed, but that the ICP was not produc- ing these data on a timely and regular basis for a sufficient number of countries as required by important potential users such as the World Bank. Moreover it indicated that the ICP was missing a governance and management structure and lacked sufficient resources and the confidence of the partici- pating countries in the quality of other countries\u2019 data. The UNSC response to the report was to ask the World Bank \u2014 the de facto global coordinator of the ICP since 1993 \u2014 to propose a strategy for a comprehensive solution to the de- ficiencies identified by the consultant. In March 2002, UNSC agreed on the implementation plan and on a new ICP phase, after the World Bank had embarked on a successful major fund-raising exercise. The reference year for the new round is 2005, with first results being scheduled for publication by the end of 2006. Regional comparisons will be organised by the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Eco- nomic and Social Commission for Western Asia and the Eco- nomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Other institutions also responsible for these assessments are Statistics Canada, the Interstate Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the State Commit- tee of the Russian Federation on Statistics (Goskomstat-Rus- sia), Eurostat and the OECD. A global office was established at the World Bank to provide overall coordination and to ensure technical and procedural uniformity across the regions. A new chapter with the European Comparison Programme One of the regional comparison programmes that resulted from the regionalisation of the ICP was the European Com- parison Programme (ECP). It was launched at the 27th ple- nary session of the Conference of Europe Statisticians (Gene- va, June 1979). The UN Economic Commission for European (UNECE) is responsible for the ECP and publishes the results of its comparisons, but the actual comparisons are organised by other agencies. This is because the ECP is an amalgam of independent comparisons involving different groups of countries. The Eurostat\u2013OECD PPP programme is central to the ECP and brings with it coverage beyond Europe through the inclusion of non-European OECD countries. EU and OECD comparisons The Eurostat\u2013OECD PPP programme was established in the early 1980s to compare the GDPs of the Member States of the EU and the member countries of the OECD. This remains the purpose of the programme, although its coverage has been extended to include countries in line for EU membership and the ones from the former Soviet Union and the former Yugo- slavia with which Eurostat and the OECD have programmes of technical cooperation in statistics. From 1980 to 1990, Eurostat comparisons took place every five years and involved mainly EU Member States and coun- tries in line for EU membership. After 1990, Eurostat adopted 34 SIGMA 01 07 building bridges sigma_EN.indd 34 12-04-2007 12:16:53 ",
        "the rolling benchmark approach in order to distribute work- load and resources more evenly over time and started mak- ing annual comparisons. The number of participating coun- tries rose from 14 in 1991 to 19 in 1994. In 1999, the number reached 31 with the inclusion of the 13 countries that were candidates for EU membership. At the same time the Eurostat programme was also regionalised into three country groups in order to manage better the increasing number of partici- pating countries. In 2006, a fourth group, covering the west- ern Balkan countries joined the programme, bringing the total number of participants in Eurostat annual comparisons up to 38. The four groups are coordinated on behalf of Euro- stat by the NSIs of Finland, Austria, Portugal and Slovenia. The OECD began organising comparisons for those OECD member countries that were not included in Eurostat com- parisons in the early 1980s. The OECD worked closely with Eurostat during the 1985 and 1990 comparisons. Formal agreements between the two organisations were made to establish the Eurostat\u2013OECD PPP programme during the 1990 round. Since 1990, the joint programme has covered all OECD member countries. OECD comparisons also cover Rus- sia, which is included in the regular publications of the joint programme. While OECD follows the rolling benchmark ap- proach for consumer prices, results for the joint programme are established only every three years. The next joint com- parison will be for 2005. An effective global development partnership Eurostat and the OECD also coordinate activities with the ICP for the 48 countries currently covered by their joint pro- gramme in order to establish the global comparison 2005 as a partnership effort of the two programmes, the joint Euro- stat and OECD programme and the ICP. The two institutions are represented on both the ICP Executive Board and the ICP Technical Advisory Group. The partnership between the Eurostat\u2013OECD PPP programme and the ICP is an excellent example of an effective global development partnership between international organisations. The two programmes collaborate on methodological improvements for the inter- national comparison of prices and volumes and the estab- lishment, validation and publication of the global results, although they are managed and organised independently.

        "Pursuing powerful partnerships: the Mercosur experience The Mercado Comum do Sul , Mercosur, was created by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in March 1991. Its purpose is to promote free trade and the fluid movement of goods, peoples and currency through the establishment of a single market. Cooperation also goes into the field of statistics where the aim is to enable the production of comparable data. In 1998, the European Union and Mercosur signed a statistical cooperation agreement and two years later a similar deal was signed between the EU and Chile. The results of the agree- ments are important synergies between the national statistical offices on the one hand and the two blocs on the other. The national statistical institutes (NSIs) of the Mercosur countries regularly participate in various international fora that supplement national and/or regional efforts to improve the informa- tion produced by the offices in the region and make it more comparable. Within the region there is also a strong tenden- cy towards bilateral, intra-bloc or inter-bloc technical co- operation activities which help to improve official statistics and their comparability at international level. however, the absence of a common statistical body within Mercosur, and therefore a shared statistical policy, combined with budget- ary difficulties, have resulted in a certain lack of coordina- tion between the national statistical offices when develop- ing their products. EU\u2013Mercosur cooperation In 1998, a statistical cooperation agreement between the Mercosur countries and the European Union was signed. It was followed by a similar agreement between the EU and Chile in 2000. The agreements, which ended on 30 June 2003, signifi- cantly improved statistical integration between the Mer- cosur countries and Chile, and strengthened economic and commercial relations between the two regions. All in- volved have appreciated the benefits of this cooperation. The positive understanding derives from the fact that sta- tistical harmonisation has had a strategic dimension, both for intra-regional relations and for bi-regional relations. It has also served as a pathway for future coordination and integration. There were four main activities and arrangements that fea- tured in the cooperation. Firstly 10 working groups with two representatives per country were established. Each group was coordinated by two European experts. The thematic ar- eas addressed by the working groups ranged from customs and foreign trade, to social statistics and relations with users and dissemination policy. There was also a group composed of the directors or presidents of the NSIs and the project\u2019s national coordinators that dealt with guidelines for statisti- cal information systems. Secondly, training for the members of the working groups were organised. The contents were defined on the basis of their needs, allied to the themes and innovations discussed during the meetings. The training modules were organised and conducted by European experts, who were thus able to bring into play the experience and expertise of Eurostat and the EU NSIs and transfer this to the reality of the Mercosur statistical offices. Methodology studies on topics of common interest to the countries were also discussed. The topics chosen were: \u00b7 quality indicator systems, as a basis for total quality plan- ning and management; \u00b7 compiling macroeconomic indicators; \u00b7 harmonising consumer price indices; \u00b7 survey on technology innovation in companies; \u00b7 collecting statistical information for the production of a statistical digest. Finally, five national sub-projects were presented, on topics of interest to the senior statistical authority of each country. They were: \u00b7 integrated system of regional statistics (Argentina); \u00b7 statistics on tourist facilities (Brazil); \u00b7 index of producer prices: manufacturing, farming and construction sectors (Chile); \u00b7 industrial sector statistics (Paraguay); \u00b7 service sector statistics (Uruguay).

        "Strengths and windows of opportunities A second phase of cooperation between the EU and Mercosur has recently begun. It is, therefore, a good moment to evalu- ate the main results of the cooperation project for the region. The cooperation has proved valuable in many areas. Firstly, it created a network of experts, which continues to exist even though the agreement has ended. It is an impor- tant and ongoing body for consultations between the vari- ous national statistical offices, contributing very positively to interchanges of experience and projects, updating of methodologies, technical assistance, etc. This framework of interpersonal relations, based on knowledge, professional respect and mutual trust, facilitates statistical work in the region. For many of the working groups, the project was the first chance for them to engage in joint activities aimed at regional statistical harmonisation. The project also resulted in a qualitative leap in the process of statistical harmonisation, both from the point of view of methodological accounting and from the point of view of obtaining harmonised data. It helped to create an aware- ness of the need within Mercosur for a body with a common vision role in order to progress further in harmonising, sys- tematising and disseminating Mercosur statistics. The need for new regional statistics has also been identified to smooth the regional integration. A number of framework agreements for statistical coop- eration have been signed by the Directors of Mercosur and Chile\u2019s NSIs. In addition, a pluri-annual statistical programme for Mercosur and Chile, covering the period 2003\u201307 was created. These examples of formalisation demonstrate the absence of previous agreements between all the countries in the bloc. A web page with statistical information, showing the advanc- es and successes achieved during the project, was created. A statistical compendium disseminating the results achieved by the working groups was also published. This publication reveals the most serious statistical problems in the areas of harmonisation and comparability and points the way to the harmonisation priorities. In brief, the cooperation project also strengthened statisti- cal integration between the Mercosur countries. It gave the countries of the region access to the experience of statistical harmonisation acquired in Europe through the EU NSI net- work, as well as to the experience of the EU\u2019s statistical insti- tutes in the creation, adaptation and application of EU and international methodologies. Special mention should also be made of the advances made on harmonisation of consumer price indexes which resulted in standardisation of 90 % of the consumer shop- ping baskets. Reference should also be made to the important work done in the field of social statistics, notably in the areas of employ- ment and education. This led not only to the drafting of har- monised methodology documents, but also to the produc- tion of harmonised indicators derived from the series avail- able in each of the countries. A long way Given the wide scope of the project, it must be said that the objective of harmonising statistical indicators between the EU, Mercosur and Chile within the timeframe of the agree- ment was extremely ambitious, and as such only partially achieved. Progress towards harmonisation was achieved in some fields, and in all fields common methodologies for compiling statistics were established, especially between the Mercosur countries and Chile. It cannot be said, howev- er, that satisfactory levels of harmonisation in relation to the statistics produced by the EU have been achieved. While information networks and databases may have been created, it is vital to establish formal continuity in exchanges and technical operations in order to ensure the production of harmonised data series. Given the limited budgets avail- able to some of the countries in the bloc, specific funding is required in order to compile statistical series and guarantee the maintenance and updating of these databases. Although provided for in the agreement, it was not possible to formalise the creation of a technical group at the Mercosur level, which would imply recognition of a permanent forum for the establishment of statistical policies associated with decision-making and standardisation of the official statistics and methodologies applied.

        "Experience has shown that both the Steering Committee and the working group composed of the statistical directors should have produced precise specifications regarding the mandates and work plans of the individual working groups, so as to obtain the best results. This was the case with the mandates of the Social Statistics Group, the National Ac- counts Group and the Social Services Group. The thematic areas were too wide-ranging, resulting in unprofitable dis- cussions during the first and sometimes even the second meetings of the groups. Similarly, before starting the activities the responsibilities of international third bodies should have been identified. By virtue of their nature and their presence in Latin America, they should have been consulted at the outset to avoid du- plication of effort and promote synergies. Finally, given the Latin American social context, it would have been advisable to involve in the project additional groups addressing other is- sues of major significance in the bloc, such as income distribution, the labour mar- ket, the informal economy, poverty, the use of admin- istrative registers kept for statistical purposes with a view to reducing the cost of statistical operations, etc. however, it should be un- derlined that the strong points far outweighed the weak points, insofar as successes were achieved which could never have been achieved outside the project.

        "Successful regional integration in southern and eastern Africa The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) is a re- gional integration arrangement consisting of 20 Member States. These are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Swaziland, Sudan, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This diverse group of countries forms a regional market of 375 million people with a combined GDP of over USD 250 billion. S ince 1993, the EU and Comesa have cooperated in the field of statistics in order to support the regional inte- gration of Comesa Member States. The treaty establishing Comesa as a regional integration ar- rangement provides a basis for understanding the vision and direction of integration in all areas of interest to the Member States. Statistical cooperation is guided by Articles 139 and 140 in this treaty. The treaty mentions the following as the motivation for cooperation in the statistical domain: \u2018The Member States undertake to cooperate in providing information that would enable them to review the func- tioning and development of the common market and move efficiently in the implementation of the provisions of this Treaty.\u2019 Cooperation between the EU and Comesa EU\u2013Comesa statistical cooperation began in 1993 under the European Development Fund (EDF 6). This cooperation was implemented under a project called Comesa Asycuda-Euro- trace regional project. The principal objectives of the region- al project were to: \u00b7 sustain existing Asycuda and Eurotrace (software to support the compilation and dissemination of customs and external trade data) projects by providing inte- grated system support and back-up services to Member States; \u00b7 assist in the implementation of new projects on request; \u00b7 organise regional training and share regional implemen- tation experience; \u00b7 build capacity at both national and regional levels. At the end of the project in December 1999, both Asycuda and Eurotrace had been installed in 12 Member States. The Eurotrace system had also been installed in five other Mem- ber States and in two non-Member States, Lesotho and Mo- zambique. The project implementation had a number of challenges particularly in the building of capacity in statistical offices that tended and still tends to take place concomitantly with high staff turnover. The first phase of the project was due to end on 31 Decem- ber 1997. however, an evaluation exercise carried out con- cluded that there was need for a successor project and a bridging finance from January to December 1998 and later to June 1999 was secured to prepare the successor project. At a workshop held in February 1998, in Lusaka, the objec- tive of the new project was defined as \u2018facilitation of im- plementation of national customs systems combined with accurate, timely, complete and comparable production and dissemination of external trade statistics at national and re- gional level\u2019. The successor project was called the regional harmonisation of customs and trade statistics systems (Rh- CTSS) project and was funded under the EDF eighth enve- lope. This project had 13 result areas, including three that dealt with statistics. \u00b7 Result 1: External trade statistics are disseminated in time the Comesa regional centre. \u00b7 Result 2: Statistical data on external trade produced by Comesa Member States are mutually comparable. The external trade statistics are produced according to har- monised nomenclatures and common statistical rules. \u00b7 Result 3: Coordination between customs, NSIs, the Come - sa regional centre and other stakeholders has been es- tablished and is effective. The project set about activating these goals by designing work programmes that were country-driven. hence one of its key successes was the establishment of a coordination mechanism in each country in order to foster a spirit of own- ership of Comesa programmes. First on data dissemination, the project introduced the service level agreements between statistical offices and customs offices as well as agreements between the statistical offices and the Comesa regional cen- tre. The country coordination mechanism also covered the aspects of organisation of user-producer workshops in each country. Eurostat played an advisory role through its partici- Photo: M-\u00c1 horcajada 39 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 39 12-04-2007 12:17:09 ",
        "pation in the Steering Committee meetings and directors of statistics meetings throughout the project. Compared to the initial status, dissemination performance of Comesa countries had improved from a time-lag of over a year to a lag of three months for many countries. Failure to achieve this result for some countries was largely due to a lack of customs modernisation (Swaziland, Djibouti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance). Modernisa- tion of customs offices was a key success factor in achieving timely dissemination of merchandise trade statistics. At the regional level, merchandise trade statistics reports were, and continue to be, produced annually. Further, the result areas covered the issue of harmonisation. harmonisation of product nomenclatures was largely de- pendent on customs modernisation as well. Most countries that had Asyuda and non-Asycuda systems adopted World Customs Organisation recommendations and were able to produce harmonised statistics. Furthermore, the design of the Eurotrace systems enabled users to produce merchan- dise trade statistics using UN recommendations such as a compilation using the general trade system. The RhCTSS project did subsume some of the roles of the predecessor project as far as capacity building in the Eu- rotrace system and its next version, the New Eurotrace Windows. Further capacity building exercises in concepts and methodology of merchandise trade statistics were un- dertaken in conjunction with the United Nations Statistical Division. Additional support to statistical offices was given through the provision of equipment. Regional integration support project Under the EDF 9, the European Union and Comesa signed a contribution agreement with a number of result areas. One of these results is the improvement and harmonisation of sta- tistics. Given the broad sweep of this result area, the Comesa Secretariat is drawing up a statistical strategy for the support of Member States in accordance to the treaty provisions. The design of this statistical strategy follows the key Comesa in- tegration programmes in trade policy, investment and infra- structure development. This reinforces the recommendations of the Directors of Statistics Meeting on the core statistical areas for the Comesa Secretariat to adopt. A number of inter- vention areas have been identified as priority areas. Statistical cooperation between Comesa and the African Development Bank In 2005, the African Development Bank signed a memo- randum of understanding with the Comesa Secretariat for the latter to coordinate the International Comparison Pro- gramme in nine Comesa Member States. The programme is developed as a capacity building programme for the Come- sa Secretariat to undertake and sustain ICP surveys in the fu- ture. Furthermore, the programme also involves work on na- tional accounts as well as collaborating in the development of national strategies for the development of statistics. A successful evaluation of EU\u2013 Comesa statistical cooperation This evaluation, insofar as enhancing the work of the Come- sa integration programme is concerned, has been success- ful. The provision and availability of merchandise trade sta- tistics for use in trade policy analysis has been cardinal in the Comesa Secretariat\u2019s work programmes. This need further highlighted the needs of Comesa to develop other statistical domains which are necessary for monitoring and analysing its integration. The cooperation model, particularly at the Comesa Secretariat level, will have to find ways continu- ally of addressing the \u2018sustainability issue\u2019 in Member States. This, above all else, is where the success of the cooperation model is best measured. But it needs to be emphasised that the statistical office and host country governments are the major determinants of solutions to the \u2018sustainability issues\u2019. Through our cooperation with the African Development Bank, there is an initiative aimed at designing a national strategy for statistical development in member countries and this to a large extent is aimed at addressing key issues in the statistical system including, inter alia, the \u2018sustainability\u2019. Further cooperation between Comesa and all cooperating partners is being coordinated so as to achieve synergies. By Themba Munalula, Senior Statistician, Comesa.

        "Croatia: from independent State to active player in international cooperation W hen Croatia became an independent country in 1991, it was necessary to establish a national statistical of- fice capable of providing a range of statistical indicators for the governmental decision-making process, for the public administration, business and citizens as well as for use in research and by academics. Over a period of more than 10 years the office was modernised, but it soon became clear that international cooperation was essential. B efore independence, Croatia had a regional statistical office carrying out a limited range of tasks, with limited experience and responsibilities. Administrative capaci- ties were insufficient for the new challenges of providing the market-oriented society with the necessary official statistics, while existing experience, knowledge and skills had to be significantly upgraded. It was a tremendous task to develop a national statistical system starting from such a position. Cooperation with international partners Gradually, organisational structures were upgraded and built, experiences widened, knowledge and skills developed. Soon, it became obvious that, if the development process was to be speeded up, it was necessary to participate in international statistical cooperation. In the 1990s, the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia (CBS) went through an intensive period of adoption of SNA 93 and ESA 95 standards, introduction of major inter- national classifications and household surveys and of general adjustment of all statistical areas to the requirements set by the market economy and democratic society. Although the majority of work was carried out without external technical assistance, statistical cooperation played an important role. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), for example, actively supported the development of Quarterly GDP. The UK De- partment for International Development (DFID) provided assistance in a number of different statistical areas, includ- ing annual GDP development and the OECD provided con- tinuous assistance in the development of purchasing power parities. As a consequence, efforts in adopting SNA 93 and ESA 95 were supported in crucial areas, providing the nec- essary transfer of knowledge to CBS staff and assistance in establishing relevant methodological foundations. In general, this period was marked by support in the assess- ment of different statistical areas in CBS and by providing guidance in the process of gradual harmonisation with the statistical acquis . The US Bureau of Labour Statistics was one of the first organisations to provide transfer of \u2018know-how\u2019 to CBS and the World Bank has also continuously supported CBS development. Increasing relations with the EU After 2000, CBS experienced the second phase in statistical cooperation, marked by increasing relations with Eurostat and several EU Member States. Planning of the Cards pro- grammes, financed by the European Union, started in 2001, and their implementation started in 2002. Currently, CBS participates in planning activities for the Phare programme. So far, several projects have been developed, mostly based on twinning, in cooperation with statistical offices from Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Slovenia, Austria, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as the OECD.

        "tion with Germany started in 2001 and lasted until 2004. Co- operation with Sweden started in 2002 and continues, while cooperation with France began in 2005 and continues, too. In this period, CBS established cooperation with statistical offi ces in Slovenia, hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro. On the right track for \u2018win-win\u2019 results It is very important to be aware of the advantages and dis- advantages of statistical cooperation, because only then can it be used as an appropriate developing tool. There is always the hope of achieving the expected results and a successful outcome of a cooperation activity, while at the same time there is an underlying uncertainty regarding possible failure. It is certainly an advantage to have a reliable partner, with suffi cient experience, relevant knowledge and skills, which can be transferred to CBS. Still, it can be perceived as cross- ing an uncharted area, requiring special concentration and attention. CBS is working intensively to adjust the existing statistics and developing new ones, which demands an additional engagement of the staff and other resources. An important issue in this respect is the impossibility of delaying or post- poning the regular production of statistics, while working simultaneously on its further development with the same personnel available for both tasks. As a consequence, it is necessary to plan cooperation activities carefully for limited and distinct periods, allowing for regular work to be done by the CBS staff involved. The majority of NSIs have a very simi- lar situation in this respect, whether benefi ciaries or donors. The greatest advantage of statistical cooperation is its vari- ety, the possibility to combine diff erent types of assistance, refl ecting diff erent needs, environments and peculiarities of the statistical areas in question. Sometimes it is quite a challenge to organise cooperation quickly in a specifi c area. When CBS needs assistance urgently, sometimes it is not possible to fi nd available cooperation instruments, while, on the other hand, it has happened that CBS had insuffi cient re- sources to make use of kind off ers of assistance from other NSIs. It requires a lot of eff ort and goodwill on both sides to fi nd the best solution. \u2018The greatest advantage of statistical cooperation is its variety, the possibility to combine diff erent types of assistance, refl ecting diff erent needs, environments and peculiarities of the statistical areas in question\u2019, writes Robert Knezevic.

        "For further information: www.dzs.hr/default_e.htm It seems that bilateral cooperation provides the most fl exible type of assistance in the initial evaluation of certain statistics and on drafting the preliminary strategic steps. An excellent example of such assistance is the meta-database develop- ment project with Statistics Sweden, which allowed for nec- essary but unforeseen changes in the project. Communicat- ing information to Eurostat and other European Commission partners on activities in bilateral cooperation proved to be es- sential in establishing the second phase of cooperation, which draws larger fi nancing, possible only through the European Commission, through Cards and Phare programmes. Such an approach enables achievement of results more quickly and in a more coherent and comprehensive manner. Large-scale activities like the development of the Business Register, as a long-term and expensive activity is being assisted through several large Cards- and Phare-funded programmes. A world of possibilities A world of possibilities It is a fact that CBS has benefi ted from statistical coopera- tion, and that further activities of this kind are to be expect- ed. It was especially useful to cooperate in some selected areas, requiring smaller CBS resources. There are numerous examples: for instance, IMF and DFID-supported develop- ment of annual and quarterly GDP, whose importance to a wide range of users does not require additional elaboration. A World Bank loan was used to develop the consumer price index, in line with the acquis , again as one of crucial macr- oeconomic indicators. Projects fi nanced from pre-accession funds are providing the development of the regional GDP, and the Business Register, with Denmark as a partner. The Agricultural Census 2003 was methodologically prepared in cooperation with consultants from Germany. Cooperation with Statistics Sweden enabled the development of a very advanced model of the macro-databases and central meta- data repository, as a technological foundation for high-level integration and standardisation of CBS operations. OECD support to the purchasing power parity project resulted in regular CBS production. These examples present a combina- tion of diff erent types of cooperation, including bilateral co- operation with some countries, international organisations and EU pre-accession programmes. At this moment, international statistical cooperation plays an important role for CBS. It is expected that pre-accession programmes, by their sheer size, will engage the majority of CBS resources and that bilateral cooperation will decrease. It is a natural thing, due to the requirements of the acces- sion process. It is possible that even the nature of these pro- grammes will shift weight from twinning projects to service contracts, as was the case in other countries. Accession will certainly bring new challenges in taking an ac- tive role and responsibility for joint development of the Euro- pean statistical system (ESS). It is advantageous both for CBS and the ESS that numerous contacts and established rela- tions with other NSIs will continue, enabling faster introduc- tion into the mainstream of development activities. Simulta- neously, CBS should continue building on well-established cooperation with neighbouring countries in south-east Eu- rope. It would be a loss for all if similarity in languages, some common statistical roots and development paths were not used for the common good. By Robert Knezevic, Head of Director-General\u2019s offi ce of International Relations, Central Bureau of Statistics of Croatia. International statistical cooperation plays an important role for the CBS. however, it is expected that the pre-accession programmes will engage the majority of the offi ce\u2019s resources and that bilateral cooperation will decrease.

        "Romania: the will to integrate into the European statistical system The National Institute of Statistics of Romania is dedicated to the full integration of Romanian statistics into the European statistical sys- tem and the related adaptation of the Romanian statistical system. Romanian statistics undergo continued improvements in order to achieve strategies, know-how and common approaches with the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries. The Romanian statistical system has gone through three development stages: \u00b7 the \u2018what to do?\u2019 period covering the years 1990\u201394, when the basic statistical knowledge (know-how) was acquired, the strategy, the programmes and the priori- ties were established and the statistical infrastructure started to be built at central and local level; \u00b7 the \u2018how to do?\u2019 period during 1994\u201399, when the sta- tistical system was restructured under the Phare pro- grammes; \u00b7 the period from 2000 up to the present, representing the statistical harmonisation stage and, from 1997, the grad- ual integration of Romanian statistics into the European statistical system.

        "ation relations in the field of statistics (particularly with the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies \u2014 Insee), this activity has expanded year after year, mainly since 1991. Today, the technical cooperation of NIS is an integral part of a system of bilateral and multilateral relations with all the general stakeholders involved (provid- ers, producers and users of statistical data) making up the comprehensive statistical system. Since 1991, the National Institute of Statistics has managed complex and difficult programmes: Phare national programmes on the one hand and Phare multi-beneficiary (horizontal) programmes, on the other. Such programmes were, and continue to be, in- tended to sustain the major objective assumed by Roma- nian statistics, namely integration into the European statis- tical system (ESS). The cooperation actions of Romanian statistics evolved over time to include the strengthening of bilateral cooperation re- lations with a number of countries (INE-Portugal, NSS-Greece, Istat-Italy, Destatis-Germany, INE-Spain, in addition to Insee- France, etc.). Moreover, the request for assistance from na- tional statistical offices generated a positive reaction from the Romanian statistical experts, who took over the obligation to provide support to the statistical development of various countries based on the experience acquired. Such requests were also understood as a confirmation of the state-of-the-art of Romanian statistics and of its success in coordinating statis- tical activities based on the scientific and technical potential achieved. Let us remember the presence of Romanian statisti- cians in the large-scale operation organised by FAO to estab- lish the concepts of the world programme for the Agricultural Census \u2014 2010, in organising the Population and Dwelling Census in Kosovo, in defining the statistical cooperation strat- egy for the western Balkan countries, etc. The list of examples could continue. Romanian statisticians are currently working for renowned statistical offices of multinational and interna- tional organisations such as Eurostat, the IMF and the FAO. In December 2000, the accession-related negotiations for the chapter \u2018Statistics\u2019 were closed. No derogation and no transition period was requested and Romanian statisticians concentrated their efforts on implementing the statistical acquis until accession. Implementing the statistical acquis Major progress was achieved in several statistical fields such as: \u00b7 adoption of EU classifications and nomenclatures; \u00b7 compilation of a business register; \u00b7 implementation of the population and dwelling census and of the general census of agriculture; \u00b7 availability of the demographic and social statistical data; \u00b7 availability of statistical data on businesses including the structural and short-term indicators; \u00b7 availability of monetary statistics data; \u00b7 adoption of the European System of Accounts (ESA 95); \u00b7 full set of harmonised price indices and purchasing power indices; \u00b7 harmonised data on foreign trade, Extrastat; \u00b7 availability of agricultural data; \u00b7 availability of most of the structural indicators. As regards the horizontal elements of the statistical system, the following results were obtained: \u00b7 data dissemination is well organised and accessible to the public; \u00b7 links between the official statistics and academic statis- tics were established. In the progress report of the European Commission on Chap- ter 12 \u2018Statistics\u2019, the conclusions were the following: \u2018Roma- nia complies with the commitments and requirements pro- vided in the accession negotiations relative to the statistical field and is expected to be in the position of implementing the acquis communautaire from the accession date. Roma- nia should continue to pay attention to the methodological development, quality improvement and data completeness in fields like national accounts, business statistics and agri- culture statistics.\u2019 Objectives of the international cooperation strategy, 2006\u201308 The major objectives for the period 2006\u201308 are sustainabil- ity, the quality of statistics and the coordination of the sta- tistical system. These objectives may be detailed as follows: \u00b7 NIS integration in the European statistical system; \u00b7 support in setting up a continued capacity of the statis- tical system, including the adoption of the total quality approach; \u00b7 NIS development as the main co-coordinator of the na- tional statistical system; \u00b7 turning statistics into a better instrument for the deci- sion-makers; \u00b7 production of harmonised statistics in compliance with the new acquis ; \u00b7 Romanian statistics should be able to cope with the new phenomena; \u00b7 achievement and preservation of the total conform- building bridges 45 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 45 12-04-2007 12:17:34 ",
        "ity with the acquis communautaire in the statistical field including its dynamics. Statistical quality: an obligation Statistics perform several functions besides the production and dissemination of the statistical data. Quality statistics imply a strictly scientific approach and the practising of suit- able methodologies understood by the users and recog- nised by society. Other directions for development are the preservation of the observation units\u2019 confidentiality and the independence of the statistical system from political inter- ventions. To achieve this, the management and planning of the statistical system have to be strengthened. Another statistical dimension is concerned with quality, which guarantees its legitimacy abroad and domestically. The mis- sion of the European statis- tical system and that of the NIS is to provide high-quality information and a systematic management of quality that is necessary to continuously identify and implement im- provements. Statistical quality also includes elements such as statistical data relevance, accuracy of estimates, data accessibility, truthfulness, comparability, co- herence and completeness. The management of quality also covers strategic plan- ning, the decision-making process, management of human resources, the increase in user satisfaction, as well as the computation of indicators measuring NIS performance. One of the envisaged objectives is the improvement of cer- tain statistical factors, such as total quality management, leading to the creation of a sustainable statistical capacity. Naturally, our strategy, planning and best intentions are not enough. Fortunately, the National Institute of Statistics has a professional staff dedicated and committed to the desid- erata of modern statistics, whose performances meet the highest international and European quality standards.

        "International cooperation speeds up the development of Tunisian statistics The statistical system in Tunisia has ex- perienced major developments in recent years to ensure its necessary adaptation to changes in the Tunisian economy and so- ciety. A reform of the system made it possible in 1999 to introduce a new statistical law which defined the tasks and components of the system, together with the prin- ciples needed to govern statistical work. These princi- ples are inspired by those adopted by the UN Statistical Commission. The use of international standards and international cooperation are regarded as essential for the development of statistical activities in the country. The strategy of economic and social develop- ment adopted by Tunisia has led it towards a liberalisation of the economy and an open- ing to the outside, especially to the Euro-Med area. The coun- try thus signed an association agreement with the European Union in 1995 and has been involved in the Barcelona Proc- ess for Europe and the Mediterranean since its inception. Tunisian statistics have matched these changes by opening to the outside and adopting international cooperation as an important means to speed up its internal development and to strengthen relations with various external partners. The aim is to boost the capacity of the country\u2019s statistical structures through training and exchanges of experience and skills and by keeping up with developments in sta- tistical methods and techniques. Cooperation of this kind makes it easier to adapt to international standards in statis- tical concepts, classifications, methods and practices. Such actions cannot fail to improve the national statistical system and to have an effect on the quality of the statisti- cal information which is produced and its comparability with international data, thereby making it easier to exchange and understand such information. Sustained cooperation especially at bilateral level Since it was set up in 1969, the National Statistical Institute of Tunisia has endeavoured to forge relations for statistical co- operation with its European counterparts and those in Africa, especially with its North African and Arab neighbours. Bilateral cooperation was, for a long time, the main thrust of the National Statistical Institute\u2019s approach, especially in the form of regular and close cooperation with the French Statis- tical Institute, Insee. This cooperation has been marked over the years by the training of several generations of Tunisian statisticians in institutes in France. In addition, a major de- velopment since the 1980s has been the introduction of an- nual and multiannual cooperation programmes which have helped to give shape to major projects, such as the introduc- Dr Ben Fekih, Director-General of the National Statistical Institute of Tunisia sitting between Taha Kshib, in charge of the Direction of Standards, Statistical Coordination and International Cooperation NSI Tunisia and Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez, Eurostat.

        "tion of a system of national accounts, the creation of tools for statistical coordination (business register, nomenclatures, etc) and the development of statistics in various areas of activity. Other arrangements with international bodies in the last 10 years have allowed the NSI to increase its skills in a number of areas. For example, a cooperation programme funded by the World Bank made it easier to introduce a national strategy for statistical development in line with Paris21 recommenda- tions. Similarly, by subscribing to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s special standard for data dissemination, Tunisia was able to improve the production and dissemination of statisti- cal information in certain priority areas, such as employment and quarterly national accounts. The cooperation work which has been undertaken over many years has not been restricted to the NSI and has af- fected various statistical sectors which come under a variety of ministries and public bodies, such as agricultural statistics, education statistics and monetary and financial statistics. In recent years the NSI has also welcomed statisticians from certain African and Arab institutes on study visits to learn about Tunisia\u2019s experiences in various statistical fields, espe- cially the creation and coordination of a statistical develop- ment strategy, population censuses, consumption surveys, prices and national accounts. This type of exchange of ex- perience and expertise and south\u2013south cooperation should be encouraged and continued as a natural extension to the traditional cooperation between statistical institutes in ad- vanced countries and their counterparts in the developing world. Cooperation of this type can be triangular in nature, by bringing together statistical bodies at various levels of development. New prospects through Euro-Mediterranean regional cooperation The regional cooperation in statistics, which has emerged since 1995 in the wake of the Euro-Mediterranean partner- ship, has led to new prospects for international cooperation and for the development of Mediterranean statistical sys- tems. The view of the Mediterranean countries is that this Cooperation work with international bodies has not been restricted to the NSI and has benefited various statistical sectors of ministries and public bodies, such as agricultural statistics, education statistics and monetary and financial statistics.

        "trend should lead to an alignment of their statistical set-ups with Europe\u2019s statistical system, thereby fostering the devel- opment of reliable national statistical systems. The features of the Medstat programme are its regional nature and the geographic scope of its involvement. The resources made available have been a major factor in car- rying out the project. Such resources have not always been available in connection with other international cooperation activities. Overall, participation in the programme has been benefi cial for Tunisia\u2019s National Statistical Institute, especially through wider contacts with new European and Mediterra- nean countries and by the improvement and impetus given to statistical activities in some areas. The programme objectives, which are aimed at harmonising concepts and methods with European standards, boosting the exchange of information among the countries involved and developing national statistical systems, are in line with the expectations of the Mediterranean statistical institutes. The areas covered by the programme have varying priorities for each of the partner countries. They nevertheless represent a basis for joint regional action in line with the priorities of the Barcelona Agreement. The actions undertaken in each of the programme\u2019s sub-projects have met with unequal progress because of the particular features and the circumstances aff ecting the implementation of each sub-programme. Benefi ts of Euro-Mediterranean Benefi ts of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation cooperation Training actions have been an important component of the programme and have allowed many Tunisian statisticians to take part in seminars, to attend specialist sessions in their particular fi eld and to get to know their European and Medi- terranean counterparts. Some sub-programmes have resulted in considerable pro- gress, especially in the case of environmental statistics. A new unit has been created within the NSI to carry out regular sta- tistical work on collecting and managing environmental infor- mation and bringing it in line with European standards. The dissemination of this information in the country\u2019s statistical yearbook and in two national compendiums on environmen- tal statistics compiled as part of the project has made it pos- sible to give a higher profi le to Euro-Mediterranean coopera- tion in this particular area and in the statistical fi eld generally. There has been a lot of activity in other sectoral sub-pro- grammes, such as external trade, transport and tourism. Data have been collected in these areas, harmonised with European standards and exchanged with Eurostat. Improve- ments have been made in the production, dissemination and quality of these statistics in spite of the diffi culties encoun- tered, especially in connection with the adoption of software programmes, such as Eurotrace for external trade and Eretes for national accounts. In addition, despite diffi culties in implementing its recom- mendations, the sub-programme on international migration prompted the NSI to incorporate this topic in the 2004 10- yearly census of the population and in the annual population and employment surveys. This, in turn, enabled a calculation of migration balances and adjustment of the population estimates based on local registry statistics. The Medstat I programme was the springboard for a great deal of activity by the various partners and got off to a suc- cessful start, albeit only in part. The long-term eff ect of the programme\u2019s actions can be assured only through continuity over time, but this has been jeopardised by the temporary halt in cooperation activities until the start-up of the Med- stat II programme. Consolidating and extending the Consolidating and extending the Consolidating and extending the scope of action scope of action scope of action The second stage of the Medstat programme which started in January 2006 is intended to build on what was achieved dur- ing the fi rst stage and to continue the eff orts towards harmo- nisation and collection, compiling data bases and the work of dissemination. Extending the scope of the programme to other areas, such as agriculture, energy and social statistics is likely to off er more opportunities to develop statistics in these areas. In spite of the regional extent of the programme and in the light of past experience, however, by taking better ac- count of national circumstances when defi ning actions there is likely to be more chance of providing a better response to the expectations and needs of the partner countries, and especially of those in the Mediterranean region. By providing a variety of openings to the outside, Tunisia has been encouraged to make social and economic information more easily available and to guarantee the quality of such information so that it complies with international standards and can be compared with the data of its partner countries. International cooperation, whether bilateral or multilateral, is a powerful factor in achieving this objective and in helping to improve the consistency and eff ectiveness of the national statistical system.

        "Medstat: the Jordanian experience As part of the overall policy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the De- partment of Statistics (DoS) has endeavoured to enhance cooperation with regional and international statistical offices, including Eurostat, within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership through the first phase of the Euro-Mediterranean statistical cooperation programme Medstat. The launching in 2006 of the second phase, Medstat II, offers an opportunity to raise a number of important issues. The Department of Statistics (DoS) has the mandate to collect, compile, store, analyse and disseminate official statistics, includ- ing the findings of censuses and surveys conducted in the demographic, economic, agricultural, environmental and cultural domains. The DoS is also required to produce data that might be needed to cover other conditions of society as well, outlining concerns and circumstances and complying with definitions, classifications, standards, methodologies and technologies internationally employed. Positive impact of Medstat I In this context, during the programme life, Medstat I con- tributed significantly to the enhancement of the statistical capacity building process at the DoS. The successful imple- mentation of the different projects has produced a wide range of positive developments related to the thematic pri- ority sectors of migration, environment, transport, national accounts, tourism or external trade statistics. In general, Medstat I has contributed significantly to im- proving the way the activities of the DoS are conducted, by bringing in methodologies, definitions and classifications in agreement with international or European standards, in line with established practice by the European statistical offices. In the field of data dissemination and data exchange, spe- cial software packages, such as Stadium-Statel, have been made available and installed in the DoS for data exchange with Eurostat. Advanced PCs and printers were also pro- vided to the DoS. In addition, the DoS, as well as the other Mediterranean countries, has been provided with a stand- ard database on environment and transport indicators. Efforts invested in that area have paid back since the first national compendium on environmental data was devel- oped under the environment component of the second phase of Medstat, MED Environment 2, a project conduct- ed by Plan Bleu, one of the regional activity centres of the Mediterranean action plan. In the field of south\u2013south cooperation, Medstat I contributed to the enhancement of cooperation among the Mediterranean partnership countries regarding data exchange, methodologies implemented and technologies used. 50 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 50 12-04-2007 12:18:08 ",
        "Medstat I also contributed to upgrading the statistical ca- pabilities of DoS staff through participation in training courses, particularly on environment statistics. Our trainers, who participated in \u2018training for trainers\u2019 courses, generated a wider impact process since they conducted local courses on descriptive statistics for DoS staff and participants from other governmental data producers for knowledge transfer purposes. The training courses provided by Medstat I were intensive in terms of content covered. The only drawback was the choice of training language, either English or French, which resulted in a reduced opportunity for participation in some Arabic speaking countries, where foreign languages are less spoken. In the field of south\u2013south cooperation, Medstat I contrib- uted to a great extent to the enhancement of cooperation among the 12, at that time, Mediterranean countries regard- ing data exchange, methodologies implemented and tech- nologies used. Challenges for Medstat II Given the regional dimension of the Medstat I programme, it was mandated to deal with all the Mediterranean coun- tries in terms of technical statistical cooperation assimilating partner countries\u2019 at the same level, somewhat reducing the possibility to take into consideration the existence of strong specificities among them. however, some weaknesses in different areas have been ob- served. For instance, in the case of Jordan, specific assistance on areas such as water accounts, household solids waste, en- vironmental health and the specialised survey on migration would have been of added benefit to help the DoS bridge any gaps in our statistical programmes. After the launch of the second phase of Medstat, new prior- ity sectors were introduced. A particular emphasis was put into tailoring the technical assistance, and other support activities to the specific situation of each partner country. Medstat I has contributed significantly to improving the way the activities of the DoS are conducted, by bringing in methodologies, definitions and classifications in agreement with international or European standards, in line with established practice by the European statistical offices.

        "Yet, it is also my view that the new phase, Medstat II, would become more benefi cial to Mediterranean partner countries, if technical assistance could be extended to certain areas such as wage indices, employment creation indicators and business condition measures. Medstat II has the necessary ingredients to become a suc- cessful vehicle to strengthen cooperation between partner countries: the transfer of know-how through organising on-the-job training, thereby providing insight into the most valid approaches to restructuring their statistical system and manpower and also providing assistance on quality control procedures.

        "The West African Economic and Monetary Union: a success story The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) was founded in 1994 in response to the devaluation of the common currency, with the goal of developing a competitive common market based on the free fl ow of persons, goods, services, and capital. Member countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. The European Com- munity has supported WAEMU from the start. The support for statistics has focused on satisfying needs from the WAEMU countries themselves, as well as economic agents. G iven the diffi cult environment in which African, Car- ibbean and Pacifi c countries\u2019 (ACP) statistical coop- eration projects operate, it is hard to fi nd one exam- ple that satisfi es all the criteria of a successful development project, i.e. one that achieves high scores in terms of eff ec- tiveness, effi ciency and sustainability. Eurostat\u2019s international cooperation focuses on regional sta- tistical programmes, which are generally more complex and more diffi cult to manage than national projects, as many more partners are involved. European Community (EC) sup- port for statistics is provided predominantly within larger aid programmes. At regional levels these aid programmes focus on regional economic integration and trade development. They are based on the region\u2019s own medium and long-term development objectives and strategies. The statistical activi- ties supported by EC funds are strongly related to regional integration agendas and their time horizons. EC support to WAEMU statistics has been chosen as a case study because the major cooperation partners consider that this assistance generated very positive results and served as an example for projects in other regions. Building a successful regional statistical system Since the foundation of WAEMU, the European Commu- nity has supported this new sub-regional organisation to strengthen regional economic integration and to defi ne and conduct regional sectoral policies (e.g. transport, food security etc.). The major part of the support for establishing harmonised regional statistics was provided within regional integration support programmes called PARI 1 and PARI 2. These programmes were funded by the seventh and eighth European Development Fund (EDF). In all, about USD \u2018The major cooperation partners consider that European Community support to WAEMU statistics has generated very positive results and served as an example for projects in other regions\u2019, writes J\u00fcrgen heimann.

        "11 million were spent from regional EC funds on statistics. This includes financing surveys in the Member States to comply with the regional information requirements. The main objective of the multiple activities in the statisti- cal domain was to satisfy the needs arising from the estab- lishment of a multilateral surveillance mechanism for the WAEMU countries, as well as to satisfy the basic informa- tion needs of economic agents. The statistical domains con- cerned were: consumer prices (including household budget surveys), national accounts (GDP), the informal sector, indus- trial production, external trade, short-term indicators and a competitiveness database. The work consisted of harmonisation activities, the devel- opment and/or implementation of statistical software (e.g. Chapo for consumer prices, Eretes for national accounts, Eurotrace for external trade), conducting statistical surveys and the improvement of the statistical capacities of the WAEMU Commission and of the national statistical systems through staff training and hardware and office equipment provision. There was no single large programme but sever- al successive projects were undertaken between 1994 and today which followed the EDF programming cycle. Priori- ty was initially given to the production of harmonised con- sumer price indices (hCPIs); work had already started by 1994. The support programme for regional statistics, Par- stat, took over in 1997 and extended the work to the above areas. The last phase, completed at the end of 2005 under PARI 2, was dedicated mainly to consolidating the results obtained under the Parstat project. Globally the statistical projects achieved their goals, despite the many difficulties of an administrative nature. The involvement of Afristat, which provided high quality services within these projects, was a major advantage. The main achievements are as follows. \u00b7 Survey on household expenditure in all WAEMU capital cities in 1996 (Guinea Bissau in 2001); publication of the survey results. \u00b7 hCPI: monthly production and dissemination of hCPI by all WAEMU countries and by the regional organisation: e.g. the June 2006 figures were published in a bulletin in July 2006 and are available on the WAEMU Commission website (see Table 1). These include the development and maintenance of Chapo, work on quality improvements of hCPI and preparation of an update of the weighting schemes. \u00b7 National accounts/GDP: improved comparability of GDP figures (see Table 2) \u2014 a regulation on the modalities to calculate GDP has been adopted with Member States producing their data accordingly. The software tool Eretes, co-owned by the European Commission (Euro- stat) and France, which produces national accounts ac- cording to SNA 93, has been implemented and is in use in all WAEMU countries, except Senegal and Guinea Bissau. however, due to weaknesses in the basic data, the quality of GDP figures is still often compromised. \u00b7 Urban informal sector: surveys were conducted in 2001 and 2003 to get data on the main characteristics of the informal sector of WAEMU countries (production units, employment, income, etc). Statistics on the urban infor- mal sector have been published at country and regional levels. They show that the estimated share of the informal Table 1: Price indices in WAEMU countries, 1996=100 (as of October 2006) 01/06 02/06 03/06 04/06 05/06 06/06 07/06 08/06 09/06 Benin 133.9 135.5 136.3 137.6 138.9 137.8 135.5 134.2 Burkina Faso 125.3 124.8 123.7 124.8 128.2 127.7 129.6 129.0 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 132.8 133.4 133.7 134.7 135.3 136.5 136.6 136.6 135.5 Guinea Bissau 179.6 182.5 184.0 184.0 185.4 189.2 190.9 192.8 191.9 Mali 112.5 112.9 113.9 114.3 115.2 116.8 117.0 116.7 117.3 Niger 121.3 121.0 121.7 121.5 122.9 126.3 126.1 126.3 Senegal 112.6 113.0 113.6 113.3 112.2 112.8 114.2 115.6 116.9 Togo 125.8 125.5 124.9 126.7 128.2 127.9 125.0 125.7 UEMOA 125.5 126.0 126.3 127.0 127.6 128.4 128.6 128.8 Source: WAEMU Commission.

        "sector in GDP ranges between 43 % (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, 2002) and 76 % (Togo, 2002). The results are used to adjust the GDP figures of WAEMU countries. \u00b7 Harmonised index on industrial production (HIIP): regular production of indices according to a harmonised meth- odology. This has been applied in Benin, Mali, Senegal and Togo. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is about to apply the harmonised methodology. In Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau and Niger, implementation has not yet started. An application pack- age for the production of HIIP has been developed and is used at national and regional levels. \u00b7 External trade statistics and trade surveillance: the im- plementation of Eurotrace in all Member States (but at present not used by C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and regular produc- tion of external trade statistics at regional levels using this software have been accomplished. Further work on harmonisation methodology is ongoing. A trade surveil- lance system, based on a selection of indicators has been designed and new modules have been developed which are linked to Eurotrace. \u00b7 Analysis of short-term economic development: the aim was to inform private and public sectors regularly on the economic situation at country and regional levels. All Member States, except Niger and Guinea Bissau, now pro- duce these bulletins de conjuncture on a regular basis and the WAEMU Commission has started to produce an ana- lytical note for the whole region. A standardised format is not used at the moment but there are plans to do so. \u00b7 Information system on social questions: the first steps (studies and workshops) on the creation of this informa- tion system, covering domains such as education, health, employment and gender, have been launched. \u00b7 Multiannual statistical programme: a regional statistical programme covering the period 2006\u201310 has been de- veloped. The programme addresses a large number of economic and social statistics that are considered nec- essary for the definition, follow-up and evaluation of WAEMU policies. The statistical activities are regrouped into four areas: 1. strengthening of convergence policy; 2. poverty and social cohesion; 3. establishment of the common market; 4. institutional strengthening. Lessons learnt Taking into account all the \u2018classic\u2019 difficulties of work in de- veloping countries/regions, i.e. a lack of financial and quali- fied human resources and governance problems, the results attained appear quite impressive. However, these were not achieved through a single programme, but through a series of projects and activities conducted between 1995 and 2005. First lesson: Be realistic regarding the time and resources necessary to manage the administrative and financial as- pects of a project. The positive results are also striking since much energy and effort (not to mention resources) had to be spent on comply- ing with the complex administrative procedures of such de- velopment projects. The WAEMU Commission had not only to observe the EDF rules but also its own internal procedures. In many cases, more time was needed to satisfy administrative requirements than to carry out the actual statistical work. Second lesson: Be realistic in defining the results that can be achieved in three- to five-year projects. Do not overload a project with too many domains and activities. The above results could not have been achieved within one single project, but only through successive rounds. In fact, the projects, seen individually, were rather overambitious and overoptimistic. The absorption capacities of the ben- eficiaries were often overstated and projects needed several Table 2: Impact of GDP harmonisation in WAEMU countries, corrections of GDP( * ) in % 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Benin 5.3 1.8 5.4 3.5 4.1 4.9 4.6 5.0 5.0 4.5 4.3 Burkina Faso 10.0 9.5 11.6 11.7 10.7 10.9 10.8 11.1 12.0 11.6 11.5 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 9.4 10.9 9.9 8.9 8.1 7.6 5.9 7.6 7.1 7.0 6.7 Bissau-Guinea 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 Mali 3.9 12.1 18.0 12.2 7.6 10.9 8.1 9.6 4.5 12.3 8.9 Niger 1.8 2.8 3.1 1.0 1.4 1.5 1.2 1.1 1.3 1.4 1.5 Senegal 4.4 7.7 8.2 7.6 5.1 4.4 5 .0 7.0 5.9 4.2 5.9 Togo 9.1 10.4 7.9 7.4 5.7 5.3 5.6 5.4 5.7 5.8 5.8 (*) The impact of GDP harmonisation is always positive because of broader statistical coverage, e.g. corrections regarding imputed rents for owner- occupied dwellings and consumption of fixed capital by general government.

        "prolongations and/or \u2018new\u2019 projects that incorporated what their predecessors had not achieved. Third lesson: Make sure that the statistical project fulfils an explicit request from strong national or sub-regional user groups; this may include actions to stimulate this demand. In addition, sustainability may be underpinned by creating legal obligations. One of the positive elements of the WAEMU statistical coop- eration is that certain activities enjoy continuing success, in particular, the hCPI. The lack of sustainability is normally one of the key problems of development aid. A major success factor was a strong demand for these statistics at political level (input for the multilateral surveillance mechanism) and therefore a continuous support from commissioners and ministers. Fourth lesson: Establish long-term collaboration which will allow the statistical capacities of these organisations to be built up. Relying on short-term experts may be useful to gain specific results. however, the transfer of expertise and the creation of institutional knowledge need continuous sup- port and partnership. The WAEMU Commission, like other regional organisations, e.g. the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), has acquired a measure of technical expertise through EC support for certain statistical areas which now enables them to manage these areas with their own perma- nent staff. They have become the owner of these processes, even though external financial support might still be occa- sionally necessary. To achieve these goals is a long-lasting process. Fifth lesson: Provide financial and technical support for in- tegrated programming and regional/national programme implementation. Regional statistical programmes need to be agreed with the Member States, which should adapt their national programmes accordingly. The international donor community should offer funding within the framework of regional and national programmes established by the partners instead of funding activities outside of these plans. A multiannual regional statistical programme developed and agreed with the Member States is an important instrument for coordination. To be success- ful, regional organisations need strongly committed Mem- ber States. There will be very limited impact if regional pro- grammes and activities are not accompanied by appropriate actions at national level. \u2026and the way forward Under the ninth EDF, a new financing agreement has been signed for 2006\u201313 to support regional integration in West Africa. This time, the agreement covers the Member States of both the WAEMU and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Eurostat will assist the Commission services in monitoring the statistical modules of this programme. The statistical mod- ules will refer to the statistical programmes of WAEMU and Ecowas and will finance selected parts of these programmes. Eurostat will make use of its long experience gained in pre- vious projects in both regions and will contribute, together with other Commission services, to the continuing of the successful creation of a regional statistical system capable of supporting West African regional integration. Eurostat will plead the case for a strong focus on data dissemination and the development of close producer/user relations. however, the major challenge will be to design the projects in such a way that the results can be sustained in an environment with very limited human and financial resources (see Table 3). All these activities will be closely coordinated with donors from EU Member States and the international organisations. By J\u00fcrgen Heimann, International Statistical Cooperation Unit, Eurostat.

        "Insee: a long tradition of international technical cooperation I nitially limited to Africa, the technical cooperation conducted by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) has gradually shifted towards other areas of the world. From the beginning of the 1990s, it focused especially on the central and east European countries. Cooperation activities have attained substantial proportions, with over 350 expert missions and over 350 study visits in some years. The re- cent accession of 10 new Member States to the European Union has meant that Insee\u2019s technical cooperation can be redeployed to other regions . T echnical cooperation by Insee forms part of a system of bilateral and multilateral relations with all parties involved in the \u2018global statistical system\u2019. The strate- gic guidelines for this cooperation are decided annually by Insee\u2019s Board of Management. This activity, which involves statistical services in ministries as well as a number of Insee services, is piloted by the International Technical Coopera- tion Unit. This unit is Insee\u2019s main contact point for French, EU or international ministries and bodies, which request or finance its actions. International technical cooperation by Insee fulfils three objectives by: \u00b7 offering technical assistance to beneficiary countries in building a statistical system, which meets the method- ological standards generally accepted at international level and in setting up partnerships with other NSIs; \u00b7 playing its part in France\u2019s policy of bilateral technical cooperation, in its fields of competence; \u00b7 contributing to multilateral cooperation programmes, under the auspices of international organisations. The importance of exchanges and training A wide range of measures is used to carry out a cooperation programme. The most common forms of cooperation at the moment are missions abroad by Insee experts and visits by representatives from partner national statistical institutes. Insee also runs national and international thematic seminars, which offer the advantage of increasing Insee\u2019s activities using the same level of resources whilst developing fruitful exchanges amongst the beneficiary countries themselves. Training is also a basic tool. Action in this area takes the form of organising training seminars and workshops. In French- speaking Africa, the technical cooperation offered by Insee comes in specific forms: support for Afristat \u2014 the Economic and Statistical Observatory for Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 and statistical colleges which are tailor-made for the regional context. Finally, Insee\u2019s technical assistance can be in the form of investment in methodology or IT tools such as the Eretes software to help compile national accounts. Statistics and economic studies Cooperation activities cover various areas of official statistics, focusing mainly on economic statistics (statistics on produc- tion, short-term indicators and national accounts). Recently, however, there have been significant developments in co- operation in the field of social statistics, particularly with re- spect to employment, living conditions and poverty. Finally, Insee\u2019s technical assistance is often requested in the field of short-term economic analysis. Photo: PixelQuelle.de 57 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 57 12-04-2007 12:18:51 ",
        "Geographical coverage In recent years, the countries of central and eastern Europe have been an important area for Insee in the field of tech- nical cooperation. The accession of most of these countries to the European Union has, however, led to a reduction in the demand for technical assistance in the form of missions and visits. Bilateral cooperation activities are being replaced more and more frequently by the organisation of seminars and training sessions. At the same time, the support given to countries bordering the EU \u2014 the Balkans, Russia and Ukraine \u2014 is being stepped up substantially. The Mediterranean basin is also one of the geographical priorities for Insee cooperation, focusing mainly on bilat- eral relations with French-speaking countries. The pro- grammes with Morocco and Tunisia are the most highly- developed and cover the widest range of fields. Lebanon and Algeria are also given technical assistance in the field of national accounts. Actions have also recently been run with other Mediterranean countries. Insee is also seeking to develop multilateral actions to meet joint needs, partic- ularly under programmes financed by the European Union (Medstat). Cooperation with sub-Saharan Africa, which remains a his- torical priority, is provided through the secondment of ex- perts to Afristat (see article below) and specific backing for its projects, support in training African statisticians and for the three African statistical colleges, and through the se- condment of teachers and assistance to education teams. In Latin America, cooperation is concentrated on actions de- veloped under regional integration programmes with clearly identified priorities aimed at harmonising statistical tools or methods for the Community of Andean Nations (CAN), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Eclac) or Mercosur. Finally, some cooperation activities are conducted in Asia and the Pacific, principally with Viet- nam on the target areas of modelling, support for schools, the training of trainers and the compilation of a French- Vietnamese statistical dictionary. Afristat is a sub-regional organisation whose mission is to assist the development of economic, social and environment statistics in its member states and to build up their capabilities in these areas. Photo: Afristat Insee cooperation in Africa through Afristat The Economic and Statistical Observatory for Sub-Saharan Af- rica, Afristat, was created in 1993 by the 14 African countries which were members of the franc area (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Comoros, Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Chad and Togo) with support from France. It started its ac- tivities in 1996. Four other countries subsequently joined the organisation: Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania in 1998, Guinea in 2000 and Cape Verde in 2002. Afristat is based in Bamako, Mali and had 14 African and French experts in 2006. Afristat is a sub-regional organisation whose mission is to as- sist the development of economic, social and environment statistics in its member states and to build up their capabili- ties in these areas. It thus forms part of the drive towards African regional economic integration, which requires the uniformity and comparability of statistical information. During the first 10 years of its existence, Afristat activities have helped these countries implement and perpetuate work in various fields of statistics and make progress in harmonisation. The nomenclatures and national price indices are harmonised at regional level. Afristat provides substantial technical support in the field of household surveys and the analysis of poverty as well as in the field of national accounts. As a result, 12 member states out of 18 have adopted the Eretes IT system for the com- pilation and harmonisation of their economic accounts. The creation of Afristat led to a sea change in Insee\u2019s cooperation with sub-Saharan Africa. Resident technical assistance, i.e. the posting of a French statistician to a statistical office abroad, has virtually disappeared in the region. Afristat is now the lynchpin of technical assist- ance to sub-Saharan Africa in the field of statistics. 58 SIGMA 01 07 building bridges sigma_EN.indd 58 12-04-2007 12:18:57 ",
        "The development of rapid economic accounts: putting talk into action One of Afristat\u2019s priorities is to overhaul the national ac- counts in its member states. The objective is to work with these countries in the regular production of reliable ac- counts, which are based on the principles and the method- ology advocated by the SNA93 (United Nations\u2019 System of National Accounts 1993). There are, however, still significant delays in compiling and publishing these accounts due to the limited financial resources allocated to them and the lack of data sources. To make up for these delays, Afristat, with the backing of Insee, is setting up a project to develop rapid economic ac- counts (which are semi-definitive and/or provisional) in its member states. This project is based on five countries which are representative of the very diverse situations encoun- tered by statistical systems in the African continent: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guinea, Mali and Mauritania. Of these five, only Cameroon, which is up-to-date in compiling its final ac- counts, is working on the development of a provisional ac- count. The other countries will drastically reduce the range of their nomenclatures in order to make up the delay, or even \u2018jump years\u2019, to get there. National accountants from these countries will then be able to offer their support in passing on the experience they have acquired during the first part of the project. In the longer term, all the countries should be in a position to produce their own accounts within acceptable deadlines.

        "German statistical cooperation is a two-way process At the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a sudden upsurge in demand for consultancy services in the wake of the changes in world politics, official cooperation in statistical matters was just getting under- way in Germany. Under externally funded projects, cooperation was soon established with the countries of eastern Europe, the former members of the Soviet Union, and China. Fifteen years later, and after more than 1 400 cooperation projects with statistical offices in around 40 countries, Germany\u2019s official statistical authority is recog- nised and in demand as a partner in international cooperation. G ermany, the eastern part of which was also under- going changes in the system, felt that it had a duty to pass on the experience it had gained on its own territory with the changeover from a planned economy to a market economy, and the federal structure characteristic of statistics in Germany could be incorporated into coopera- tion projects as a strong point. One-off cooperation projects in specific areas have often grown into a multidisciplinary programme and initial con- tacts have led to long-lasting and close partnerships. We assisted some of our partner countries \u2014 and this is some- thing that seemed a long way off when our cooperation began \u2014 not only in the changeover to a market economy but all the way to accession to the European Union and hence their full integration into the European statistical system. Partnership between participants Whether with candidates for EU accession (and, since 1 May 2004, new EU Member States), with the countries in- volved in the new European neighbourhood policy, or with threshold and developing countries outside Europe, Germa- \u00a9 EC 60 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 60 12-04-2007 12:19:08 ",
        "ny\u2019s statistical cooperation is always aimed at establishing a genuine partnership between the statistical offices involved. The prime aim of every cooperation project is to pass on specialised knowledge in such a way that it will be retained, and thus contribute to the development of statistical capac- ity. Solutions that are regarded as ideal in Germany are not models to be taken over lock, stock and barrel by the partner countries. Instead, the experts of the participant countries meet in order to devise solutions that will work in the long term in the partner country. A good example is the \u2018cross-border friendship database\u2019, which was developed jointly by Polish, Czech and German statisticians and made available to the public in 2004. This database, which contains a large volume of readily compa- rable statistics on Poland, the Czech Republic and Saxony, makes a major contribution to cross-border exchanges. A bilateral project with the Chinese Statistical Office on for- eign statistics is also a good example of how statistical co- operation can benefit both sides. China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has finally set up a publicly accessible data- base containing foreign statistics and published, for the first time, a yearbook of foreign statistics. The Federal Statistical Office has followed China\u2019s example and added further titles of tables, column headings and breakdown items in English. At an international conference of the International Mon- etary Fund (IMF) on the future of statistics in China, held on 30 and 31 May 2000 in Beijing, experts singled out the Ger- man-Chinese project \u2018Reorganisation of industrial and trans- port statistics in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019 from some 30 other projects as exemplary because, in accordance with the United Nations recommendations on technical cooperation in the field of statistics, it was closely based on the require- The Cooperation Unit in Bonn.

        "ments and conditions characteristic of the beneficiary coun- try, and because both partners shared the responsibility for the implementation and results (ownership). Twinning projects The philosophy of exchanges between experts in the inter- ests of both parties is particularly clear in Germany\u2019s statistical twinning projects promoted by the European Commission. First and foremost, \u2018twinning\u2019 means a close administrative partnership in connection with a specific, multidisciplinary project. On top of this, the cooperation is organised in such a way that it continues after the project as such has been completed. Since the twinning project with the Polish Statistical Office on a statistical information system was launched in 2002, German statisticians have become active in this area with considerable success. Regular exchanges between the ex- perts involved and a high level of own-responsibility on the part of the beneficiary country are characteristic features of twinning, and our own approach to cooperation is also clearly manifested in these projects. In the meantime we have embarked on further twinning projects with Bulgaria, Latvia and Macedonia. We have had a close partnership with the Turkish Statistical Office for several years now, and this has been stepped up in connection with the project entitled \u2018Upgrading the statisti- cal system of Turkey (USST)\u2019. here too, exchanges between German and Turkish experts help both partners to learn from each other. For example, it is planned to introduce the jointly developed classification server for business statistics in the Federal Statistical Office too. Preparation of the experts Another important principle guiding our cooperation ac- tivities is the wide-ranging, rather than merely technical, preparation of the experts for their work. Despite an in- creasing number of international contacts, including ones The Cooperation Unit in Wiesbaden. Years of experience have shown that transferring technical and methodological expertise is not enough to provide the beneficiary countries with efficient support. 62 SIGMA 01 07 building bridges sigma_EN.indd 62 12-04-2007 12:19:18 ",
        "For further information: www.destatis.de www.crossborderdatabase.de outside the field of technical cooperation, the fact remains that working as an expert in a cooperation project makes different demands from the \u2018normal\u2019 working situation in one\u2019s own statistical office. It is not only a matter of having expert knowledge; it is also important to be able to put this knowledge across. The experts therefore receive language training \u2014 in the form of English courses, for example \u2014 and instructional training \u2014 for example, in the form of courses on presentation techniques, team development or international negotiation techniques \u2014 in preparation for their assignments. The efficient preparation of our experts contributes substantially to the success of our cooperation measures. here we can reap the benefits of years of experi- ence: younger experts are introduced to international co- operation with the support of our \u2018old hands\u2019, and in this way, we can hand over to the next generation, while still benefiting from past experience. Intercultural preparation is, however, also steadily gaining in significance. For example, our major cooperation project with Turkey in Wiesbaden was launched with an intercul- tural communication event at which a speaker told the par- ticipants something about the history and culture of the country and introduced them to features and conventions that are characteristic of a normal working day in Turkey. A major project with China also began with intercultural training of the project leaders. Intercultural preparation will continue to gain in significance, since it is apparent that the emphasis on statistical cooperation by Germany has for some time now been shifting towards new regions \u2014 particularly in the neighbouring countries to the east and south-east of the EU and the non-European countries covered by the UN initiative for reducing poverty (millen- nium development goals). From beneficiaries to providers of expertise This geographical extension of cooperation activities is a response to political requirements, but is also a reflection of the development of the statistical systems of the new Member States \u2014 not least because of the success of con- sultancy work hitherto. A clear change can be detected in relations with countries such as Poland, the Czech Repub- lic, Slovenia or Slovakia: whereas cooperation work used to be largely focused on those countries, they are now devel- oping from beneficiaries of support into partners that take on, together with German experts, cooperation projects for other countries. Statistical capacity building \u2014 a new focus Not only are the partner countries changing \u2014 so is the sub- ject matter of the cooperation projects. Years of experience have shown that transferring technical and methodological expertise is not enough to provide the beneficiary coun- tries with efficient support. In order to ensure sustainabil- ity, the organisational structures, administrative procedures and personnel management of the statistical offices must be geared to the requirements facing them as providers of modern information services. This is what is meant by \u2018statis- tical capacity building\u2019. We attach great importance to improving the institutional context, and, for this reason, we are increasingly includ- ing interdisciplinary elements in our cooperation projects. Events on subjects such as strategic planning, staffing or project management are aimed at the managerial level in the partner authorities. The Federal Statistical Office has, for several years, been offering modular courses tailored to the situations in the partner countries in question on the basis of the existing level of knowledge and need for support. Ex- amples include workshops and study visits on total quality management in Bulgaria and Turkey, seminars on strategic management in Serbia, and a joint \u2018Twinning-light project\u2019 with the Czech Statistical Office entitled Strategische Planung und Management statistischer Aktivit\u00e4ten [Strategic planning and management of statistical activities]. Germany\u2019s statistical cooperation will also be geared in future to the inclusion of multidisciplinary elements of this kind in projects for the further development of technical capacity, in order to ensure their success in the long term. After more than 15 years of successful activity it is clear to us that statistical cooperation is a two-way process. Knowledge is transferred in both directions, since an important side-ef- fect of communicating technical expertise is the strengthen- ing of the competence of our own experts.

        "Istat: cooperation leading to results I stat, the Italian National Institute of Statistics, has been focusing on statistical cooperation since the mid-1990s. Its involvement has increased considerably in the past few years, and statistical cooperation is now considered a \u2018core business\u2019 of the Institute. Over the years, the nature and amount of Istat\u2019s statistical co- operation, as well as the areas of intervention and coopera- tion partners have changed. If at first it responded to specific limited requests originating either from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs or from Eurostat, it has now developed its own strategy, which strives to meet, as far as possible, the requests of partner countries\u2019 national statistical institutes (NSIs) with both the internal expertise and financial resourc- es available in the office. The strategic objectives of Istat\u2019s statistical cooperation are to: 1. reinforce national statistical systems, advocating the adoption of European and international standards and the sharing of best statistical practices; 2. strengthen the role of Istat at the international level, in- tervening in sectors where it can offer qualified expertise and ensure effectiveness of actions; 3. promote the presence of Istat in national and interna - tional contexts concerning the role of official statistics for the monitoring of development policies; 4. step up relations with national institutions, notably the Ital- ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responsible for the design of development cooperation policies and for the bilateral funding, inter alia, of statistical cooperation projects. Sources of funding Istat own resources allocated to technical cooperation ac- tivities are limited and not enough to cover all requests and needs. The sources for project financing are thus mainly ex- ternal, although Istat often contributes especially by assign- ing additional human resources. Photo: Pierre Cester 64 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 64 12-04-2007 12:19:20 ",
        "The main external funding sources are: \u00b7 the Italian Government, by means of agreements be- tween Istat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2014 Directo- rate-General for Development Cooperation; \u00b7 the European Commission, through its public tenders and twinning contracts, and, to a limited extent, with grants managed directly by Eurostat; \u00b7 other sources, either bilateral from other countries (for example the UK Government Department for Interna- tional Development (DFID)) or from international organi- sations, such as the IMF, World Bank, Paris21, etc. In recent years, the need to set up consortia to participate in European Commission tenders has introduced an inter- esting new dimension to cooperation, forcing the provid- ers of technical expertise to cooperate among themselves in order to streamline resources and know-how to deliver results. In addition, NSIs often have to deal with private sec- tor enterprises and institutions. Although the majority of Istat\u2019s projects are currently implemented in partnership with other NSIs, Istat is adapting itself to these new tender- ing procedures by presenting projects jointly with private institutions. Choosing partner countries The selection of Istat cooperation partner countries is mainly demand-driven. Other criteria depend on the evaluation of various issues and circumstances. On the one hand, the relevance that the partner country has for our institutional and financing bodies, mainly the Italian Government and the European Union, is taken into consideration in order to gain the maximum support from both the political standpoint as well as the availability of funds. 1 165 850.74 2 040 902.17 993 548.62 394 525.00 357 990.24 110 841.67 801 473.31 98 000.00 Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Cape Verde Kosovo Montenegro Mozambique Serbia Other countries 0 500 000 1 000 000 1 500 000 2 000 000 2 500 000 Projects by country, and amount implemented by Istat, since 2004 (EUR) EC 52 % IMF 4 % DFID 1 % Italian Government 43 % Sources of funding building bridges 65 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 65 12-04-2007 12:19:21 ",
        "On the other hand, it is necessary to take into careful consid- eration the availability of the human resources with relevant expertise in the thematic fields where technical assistance is required. The practical assurance that those resources will be released when needed, whether within Istat or any consor- tium member, is a possible problematic area, as cooperation activities are often seen as \u2018additional activities\u2019, able to be rearranged around more urgent NSI activities. In addition, another important element to take into account when choosing a partner country, is the knowledge of the NSI and the country itself. Although this is not a general rule, the knowledge of the context is very relevant to the way ac- tivities are designed, planned and implemented. It can add to the effectiveness of the intervention, both in terms of the results achieved and of the wider possibility of having an im- pact within the statistical system and beyond, into the local or national policy environment. Istat was initially active in central and east European coun- tries (today\u2019s new Member States or candidate countries), in the western Balkans and in Russia and the Newly Independ- ent States, with ad hoc activities, mainly supported by Euro- stat. In recent years it has widened considerably its areas of intervention to southern and eastern Mediterranean coun- tries, China, Cape Verde and Mozambique, and some Latin American countries (Mercosur and Andean Pact). The graph on the previous page shows Istat\u2019s partner coun- tries in projects from 2004 onwards. Countries are shown on the basis of the amount of Istat\u2019s direct involvement, but most projects are larger in amount given the participation of other NSIs and institutions. This graph alongside shows the overall amount of Istat\u2019s cooperation projects from 2004. Most projects, al- though implemented in consortium with other NSIs or institutions, are managed directly by Istat, which is re- sponsible for the technical delivery. Areas of intervention Istat has been involved in many different cooperation subject matter areas. In prac- tice, the possibility to decide in which areas to intervene is always fairly limited, as these are mainly set by both the requesting country and the donor in- stitution. Istat may, however decide not to intervene in a given project due to a lack of expert availability in the specific area. It should also be noted that a certain number of donors do not financially support data collection activities, which are very important for countries where the basic statistical struc- ture is not yet in place. Although the non-allocation of funds for data collection is considered an element of sustainabil- ity for the NSIs, the result may be a slowdown in the avail- ability of quality data. The support for data collection, or the lack of it, characterises considerably the type of intervention provided. Projects that imply data collection have a direct impact on both the availability of better quality data in the short to medium term, as well as on the nature of the techni- cal assistance provided, as they require continuous support and hands-on training throughout the whole production cy- cle. Other projects, focusing mainly on methodological train- ing or analysis, may lead to good or even excellent results as far as methodological and theoretical knowledge, but this is then applied to existing data, of often poor quality. The graph on the next page shows the major areas of in- tervention of the components \u2014 within each project men- tioned above \u2014 implemented by Istat directly.

        "a stronger statistical capacity of countries, even within the wider context of poverty reduction strategies and the moni- toring of millennium devel- opment goals, calls for an increased and even more fo- cused level of participation of NSIs, aimed at strength- ening national statistical systems, with a view to sup- porting evidence-based de- cision-making, monitoring processes and measuring new phenomena. In order to allow and strengthen the active participation of of- ficial statisticians in techni- cal cooperation activities, NSIs need to be supported, as they are often faced with the difficult option of com- plying with their current and ever-demanding statistical production work and releasing qualified professional resources for cooperation activities. Istat\u2019s areas of intervention The case of Bosnia and Herzegovina The projects that Istat has developed with Bosnia and herze- govina (Bih) in the field of statistics over the past years are a significant example of all the issues mentioned above. The first contacts were established 10 years ago at the initiative of colleagues from Bih, when the overall geopolitical situation was still quite unclear, which had an impact on the institution- al statistical set-up. The Italian Government was, at the time, the first foreign body active in the statistical field, followed by the EU, which highlighted the need to have a statistical body able to represent the State as a whole, and thus be able to re- ceive foreign financing. Pressure, particularly from the EU, cou- pled with the crucial need to have quality data, resulted in the establishment in 1998 of the Bosnia and herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BhAS), which, together with the two pre-exist- ing statistical offices, forms the core of the national statistical system in Bih. The existing statistical institutions, the Federal Office of Statistics of the Federation of Bosnia and herzegovi- na (FOS) and the Institute of Statistics of the Republika Srpska (RSIS), together with the BhAS, have had to undergo a reor- ganisation of their duties and responsibilities, the working en- vironment, staff and reference governing body: the process is still ongoing, and subject to continuous updating. In Bosnia and herzegovina, Istat has worked within the frame- work of projects funded by different institutions, which has exposed our institute to very different implementation pro- cedures: as a partner in a consortium in an EU-funded project, working with funds of Italian bilateral source, in a twinning project also funded by the EU, with very specific rules, and in a new project co-financed by Italian and UK resources.

        "The possibility to experience different implementation pro- cedures in the same country has been enlightening and val- uable for Istat. On a general basis, it allows the comparison of the impact different rules may have on technical assistance. It also shows which rules are most suited to obtain quality results and to ensure sustainability. It would be interesting to compare these views with the experience of the partner institutions in Bih. The use of these different procedures was also linked to the different areas of intervention Istat has been involved in. Istat was initially engaged in a variety of \u2018basic\u2019 fields \u2014 ranging from the setting up of the basic statistical in- frastructure, the law, basic organisation of work among the institutes, training and IT. It then moved to the implemen- tation of activities in more limited, but relevant, subject matter areas such as national accounts, to finally focus on the design and implementation of the household budget survey (hBS), thus covering a complete production cycle. Also from this angle, the work has enabled an in-depth analysis of the different options that are made available when merging the type of work required in the given field and the way that this is put into practice. Certainly both of these variables \u2014 funds and areas of intervention \u2014 are strictly linked, and often it is the combination of the two (coupled with the type and quality of the human expertise provided) that determines the success or failure of a techni- cal cooperation project. Coordination leading to results One other important area of work which Istat has experienced, in particular throughout its presence in Bosnia and herzegovi- na, concerns coordination among donors. This very important activity \u2014 to which the community of donors does not dedi- cate sufficient attention and efforts \u2014 has been initiated quite efficiently in Bih, with the organisation of donor meetings in the field of statistics: Istat itself organised the first one in 1998, which was then followed by other such meetings organised by international institutions. The activity is now rightly under the auspices of the Bosnia and herzegovina Agency for Statistics and has brought some good results in the implementation of the projects. Given the fairly short history of intervention by donors in the country and the sound and correct manage- ment of the projects by the active donors themselves, coordi- nation among them in this country has proven to give results. Bosnia and herzegovina is a country which is making efforts to establish a sound national statistical system, taking on board all the needs and requirements to reach compliance progressively with the acquis communautaire , respectful of national characteristics and needs. The projects implement- ed by donors in full partnership with the local statistical institutes are aimed at supporting such developments and strengthening local capacities in a sustainable manner. By Michelle Jouvenal, office for International Relations and Cooperation, Istat. Coordination among donors is a very important activity that often lags behind. however, in the case of Bosnia herzegovina it was efficiently organised from the start. At present coordination is under the auspices of the Bosnia and herzegovina Agency for Statistics and has brought some good results in the implementation of the projects. 68 building bridges building bridges sigma_EN.indd 68 12-04-2007 12:19:25 ",
        "Statistics Lithuania: from beneficiary to assistance provider P reparation for membership of the EU and the transformation of Lithuania\u2019s economy from a planned to a market economy marked a challenging stage in the history of Statistics Lithuania. The qualifications and knowledge acquired by our statisticians during that period have, in recent years, allowed Statistics Lithu- ania to assist less experienced statistical offices. S tatistics Lithuania experienced some very busy years taking on board all the EU acquis communautaire in statistics to comply with EU requirements and stand- ards. The process was guided by the European Union with the aid of experts from the EU Member States and interna- tional organisations. Numerous experts used to \u2018live\u2019 at Statistics Lithuania, shar- ing their knowledge and experience. The efforts of the de- voted staff of Statistics Lithuania, with the assistance of the EU consultants, finally resulted in successful integration within the ESS. The increased qualifications of specialists and the knowledge gained and accumulated in the acces- sion process have now opened up a new opportunity and perspective for Lithuanian statisticians, on top of their day- to-day statistical business, to undertake technical assistance projects and get actively involved in providing expertise to less experienced statistical offices. The strategy outlined In 2002, a strategy for Statistics Lithuania for 2002\u201304 was drafted, including the first steps towards providing technical assistance. The Russian-speaking countries, i.e. those of the former Soviet Union, were the first that Statistics Lithuania started to work with. This decision was determined by four factors. Firstly, Statistics Lithuania has spent most of the last decade strengthening its capacity and securing well-motivated and professional staff, who, in turn, could pass on their expertise to others. Their experience with the transition is recent and therefore fresh. Secondly, there are some similarities between the statisti- cal systems. Nobody can deny the value of the \u2018old Member The international consulting team of Statistics Lithuania: Raimonda \u0160imiene, Dalia Ma\u010diuitiene, Laima Brakauskiene, Daiva Norkevi\u010diene, Gaile Dap\u0161iene, Alma Rutkauskiene and Michail Solovjov. In the coming years, Statistics Lithuania will continue providing technical assistance to, for example, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the western Balkans. 69 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 69 12-04-2007 12:19:29 ",
        "States\u2019 and their competence has contributed enormously. In some cases, however, their experts may have faced a lack of knowledge and understanding of how the statistical sys- tems used to function in the beneficiary countries and what could be the least painful and shortest path to the European standard. This path is not easy, but is now very familiar to the Lithuanian statisticians. Thirdly, there is the Russian language, which is becoming a more and more difficult challenge since all methodologies, concepts and especially terminology are in English. however, the vast majority of our experts have a very good command of Russian. Direct communication on complex statistical topics without using the services of interpreters or transla- tors has enhanced the value of our expertise. This might be a problem in the future though, since the new generation more often opts for French or German as the second foreign language at school. Last but not least, apart from the actual knowledge gained from international experts, the staff of Statistics Lithuania have benefited from the way these experts work, how they communicate, etc. since communication skills are equally as important as professional skills. All these factors meant that including technical assistance in the strategy was a realistic possibility. The strategy docu- ment stated that \u2018Lithuanian statistical experts with their up- graded skills are able to provide methodological support to the countries in the process of transition towards a market economy and aiming to implement the fundamental princi- ples of official statistics, and are able to take part in projects to advise the experts of the statistical agencies of the Balkan countries and Tacis countries on business, foreign trade, de- mographic and other statistical issues, under the methodo- logical guidance of Eurostat and the experts of the statistical agencies of the EU Member States\u2019. The strategy for 2005\u201307 carries forward the strategic targets of the previous years and states that \u2018in cooperation with the other NSIs, Statistics Lithuania will participate in providing technical assistance to other countries, such as those of the CIS, western Balkans, and others. In some cases such projects will be developed and implemented by Statistics Lithuania itself\u2019. The latter aim coincides with Lithuania\u2019s strategy to expand its development cooperation as a donor country. Concrete experience with technical assistance From 2001 to 2003, the specialists of Statistics Lithuania pro- vided consultancy services for the Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan statistical services within the Tacis pro- gramme in the area of business and foreign trade statistics. In the business statistics project for Kazakhstan and Kyr- gyzstan, the data quality of business statistics was improved by introducing a new business statistics system based on co- ordinated characteristics and observation units used in dif- ferent types of business statistics surveys and reducing the response burden on enterprises. The contents of the business statistics surveys, their periodicity, the questionnaires used, data treatment methods and the publication of the results were studied in the two countries. The possibility of imple- menting EU standards for short-term and structural business statistics was analysed and discussed. Recommendations for the improvement of the business register in order to meet business statistics needs were made, so that the beneficiar- ies could introduce concrete improvements. The project dealing with foreign trade in goods and services in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan brought about improvements in statistical methodology, the procedures for data compi- lation, processing and correction, and the dissemination of statistics on foreign trade and international trade in services. The quality and coverage of foreign trade data was increased by expanding cooperation between customs and the sta- tistical offices. There were improvements in data verifica- tion and correction routines, such as price and logic checks and the analysis of data coverage in customs procedures. Mirror comparisons were made between the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan foreign trade statistics and reasons for discrep- ancies were identified. Uzbekistan introduced an extended services classification in the survey on international trade in services. Kazakhstan made substantial improvements in the international tourism statistics survey by preparing and implementing new questionnaires.

        "For further information: www.stat.gov.lt/en The above results reflect the success of the projects, but this is not always measurable, since the transition from theo- retical acknowledgement of the problems to solutions and practical implementation always requires more time and ef- fort than is usually foreseen in the projects, given that the period available to implement the projects is often very limited. Apart from concrete statistical knowledge, each project always provides additional value that can contrib- ute to the overall development of the beneficiary statistical office. A presentation of the Lithuanian statistical system, its functions, structures, planning, programming, development projects, etc., is always on the agenda for the consultancy visits, thus giving beneficiaries an opportunity to under- stand how the entire system operates in the new European environment. The right ingredients for success A few remarks may be made on important risk factors. Firstly, the support of the beneficiary\u2019s top management is crucial. Even before the start of the project, their clear commitment to have the EU statistical standards fully im- plemented in their offices is indispensable; otherwise the projects would be implemented more on a theoretical than a practical level. The willingness of the statistical office of a beneficiary country to adopt the EU statistical standards and its ability to introduce them should be clearly expressed and communicated throughout the statistical office. Secondly, most of the post-Soviet countries previously used a different set of statistical standards and were obliged to exchange data within the CIS according to these standards. The implementation of new concepts takes a long time. The beneficiary country has to be aware that the changes in statistical standards have to be introduced in all related areas of statistics to ensure coherence across statistical fields. For instance, a new concept for statistical units to be introduced in industry statistics should be also taken into account in developing retail trade or services statistics and in the national accounts. Therefore, a long-term strategy is advisable for introducing the new concepts and standards approved by the top management, with projects prepared accordingly. Thirdly, teamwork in the beneficiary country is advisable so that more specialists could benefit from the project, and continuity is secured in case specialists are replaced. Fourthly, in cases where several donors are involved in de- veloping the same statistical area in the beneficiary country, coordination between them is of utmost importance, so as not to overburden the beneficiary statistical office with the same fact-finding tasks and, even more importantly, to avoid the duplication and overlapping of actions. The challenges of change It is almost a clich\u00e9 to say that change has to become a way of life for transition countries. Nevertheless, changing peo- ple\u2019s thinking and behaviour is the way to success, and peo- ple need to be comfortable with such change. Knowledge is the capacity for effective action. Also important is the ability to deal with many different people. When people feel that you are interested in them, when you try to find the right solution taking into account their viewpoints, then they will open up and the efficiency of dialogue will be much greater. There is always a further improvement to make, another step to take, even if it is a great challenge! By Daiva Norkevi\u010dien\u0117, Head of the European Affairs and International Cooperation Division, Statistics Lithuania. The knowledge gained in the accession process has opened up a new opportunity and perspective for Lithuanian statisticians \u2014 to undertake technical assistance projects and get actively involved in providing expertise to less experienced statistical offices.

        "Spain\u2013Latin America statistical cooperation: a focus on training The National Statistics Institute (INE) of Spain is in charge of the \u2018prepa- ration and implementation of general plans for international tech- nical cooperation in statistical matters\u2019, according to the Spanish Law 12/1989 of 9 May on the Function of Public Statistics. The International Relations Directorate is the executive unit responsible for the boosting, promotion and manage- ment of the statistical technical cooperation activity. This is carried out within INE with other countries and in line with the general guidelines established by INE\u2019s Manage- ment Board, on the basis of the Framework Plan for Spanish Cooperation 2005\u201308 drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. INE Spain has in partic- ular a long tradition of cooperation with Latin American countries in which training occupies a significant place. In this context, the International Rela- tions Directorate organises and participates in multiple cooperation and technical assistance actions at an international level. however, due to the fact that the available resources are limited, it is essential to give priority to INE\u2019s preferred action areas. INE develops its cooperation activities basically in three geographical regions: Latin America, central and eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean countries. Latin America: These are countries that have special historic and cultural links with Spain. In the last 30 years, INE has developed an intense and continuous cooperation with them. INE organises various types of activities through the im- plementation of the Latin American statisticians training programme, with the support of the Spanish International Cooperation Agency (AECI), and within the cooperation agreement framework between INE and the International and Latin American Foundation of Public Policies and Gen- eral Government (FIIAPP). Training courses, seminars and missions have been carried out within this programme, both in Spain and in several countries of the Latin Ameri- can region. Moreover, INE has intensified the bilateral relationships with the national statistical institutes of Mexico, Argentina and Chile, and the Secretary-General of the Andean Communi- ty (CAN) by signing memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with them. Putting into effect the MOUs has automatically strengthened the cooperation actions carried out with all these organisations. Finally, INE also receives and manages multiple bilateral co- operation applications coming directly from the statistical institutes of the Latin American countries. Central and eastern Europe: Technical assistance of INE in this region is focused on support to the new Member States and candidate countries in their transition process, with regard to the institutional development and the updating and improvement of their national statistics systems. In this geographical area, the INE contributes intensely to helping these countries to implement the acquis commun- autaire related to statistics through the PhARE programme, which is funded by the European Union. More specifically, INE has organised a number of study visits, traineeships and in-country training courses for statisticians of the national statistics offices of these countries. Mediterranean countries: INE is currently increasing its coop- eration activities in this area through the European Commis- sion Medstat II programme. Outside these three main geographical regions, INE always tries to meet the requirements of the applications received from any statistical office that asks directly for cooperation actions and technical support. The Latin American statisticians training programme The main objective of the Latin American statisticians train- ing programme is to reinforce and update the Latin Ameri- can statistical systems through their human resources train- ing. By this, INE contributes to the methodological harmoni- sation, the comparability of the statistics produced in Latin America, and the exchange of knowledge and know-how, Antonio M. Salcedo Galiano, Deputy Director of International Relations, National Statistics Institute of Spain. 72 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 72 12-04-2007 12:19:35 ",
        "thus promoting best practices in all the countries. This pro- gramme includes among its activities the carrying out of courses, seminars and expert missions in order to provide short-term technical assistance. The Latin American statisticians training programme is the international technical cooperation programme with the longest tradition of the INE. The programme is now jointly financed by INE and the AECI. The administrative and financ- ing management is the responsibility of the FIIAPP, which is an organisation with wide experience and great importance in the international cooperation scene. INE\u00b4s share of the budget usually covers registration fees, travel and hotel expenses of the lecturers and participants. There is, in addition, an in-kind amount that includes classrooms, edu- cational material, secretary services, mail services, telephone, supplies, etc. The AECI contributes with the lodging and main- tenance of the participants in the seminars held at its training centres located in Antigua (Guatemala), Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) and Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia). These centres place at the disposal of the programme their logistical infra- structure and staff resources. It should be mentioned that there is a growing participation of the statistical offices and the central banks of the Latin American region, and they often of- fer their collaboration as hosts for the holding of seminars. The programme tries to fulfil the current needs of the statisti- cal offices of the Latin American countries, focusing on the main development objectives. The learning activities com- bine a theoretical approach with a practical method, so that the participants are able to apply and transmit the acquired knowledge within their organisations. Since 1992, when the first course was organised, more than 3 300 statisticians from Latin America have been trained. In 2005, two two-week courses were carried out in Spain and five one-week seminars were held in Latin America. In 2006 a total of 11 training activities took place under the pro- gramme: six of them were organised in Spain, four in Latin America, and there was an additional e-learning course via the Internet. The 2006 training activities of the programme covered many different statistical topics. The training activities held in Spain dealt with household surveys, tourism statistics, statistical indicators for decision-making, national accounts, financial accounts, and data collection. In the case of the training activities organised in Latin Amer- ica, there were four seminars planned on modernisation of the national statistical offices, science and technology indi- cators, statistical classifications and registers, and industrial indicators and surveys. Lastly, there was one additional on- line course about fundamentals and practices of surveys to enterprises and establishments. By Antonio M.

        "UK support to statistical capacity building The United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) supports long-term programmes to help tackle the underlying causes of poverty. The main focus of all our work is the achievement of the eight internationally agreed millennium development goals (MDGs). D FID is unique amongst bilateral development agen- cies in having a cadre of statistics advisers who work in developing countries as well as in headquarters. DFID\u2019s statistics advisers fulfil a variety of roles including: producing internal management statistics on DFID\u2019s pro- grammes and expenditure; providing statistical and analyti- cal support to DFID policy areas; supporting national gov- ernments to strengthen their statistical capacity; and work- ing with the international system to better monitor progress towards the United Nations\u2019 millennium development goals (MDGs). DFID statistics advisers are members of the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) Government Statistical Service. This article focuses on the work DFID does to support statistical capac- ity building in partner countries and in the international sta- tistical system. Across the international development community, demand is growing to improve the capacity of national and interna- tional statistical systems to produce and use data for devel- opment. National governments and donors are realising that statistics are needed not only to monitor development progress but also in order to achieve it. Better statistics make it possible to analyse complex social and economic prob- lems in detail, help policymakers choose the best interven- tions to deliver the desired outcomes and allow progress to be monitored and evaluated. A flexible and demand-driven approach The principle of DFID\u2019s support to statistical capacity build- ing is that we take a holistic approach. In essence, we have no single method or preferred means for providing sup- port to statistics \u2014 although the overarching principle is that the need is demand driven. For example, we support national governments (both national statistical offices and the broader national statistical systems), regional bodies, and international agencies. Our support can be in the form of funding, provision of technical expertise or the second- ment of our staff. We cover all the dimensions of a statistical system from the legal framework to the physical infrastruc- ture, from staff management and training to dissemination and release practices. Our support is not sector specific and we allow our partners to draw on experts from around the world not just from the UK. Support can be short term and discrete or long term and strategic or any combination of the above. We believe that this flexible approach offers the potential to achieve the best long-term and sustainable outcomes. how- ever, it also makes it much harder for us to assess the impact and attribute this to our support rather than if we were just funding a survey, providing a training course or helping a country move to latest system of national accounts. The fol- lowing examples from our current portfolio of work demon- strate the variety of approaches. \u00a9 EC 74 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 74 12-04-2007 12:19:43 ",
        "DFID supports developing countries such as Uganda, Tanza- nia, Pakistan and Bolivia. Supporting statistical development in Uganda DFID has been providing technical and financial assistance to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), since it became a semi-autonomous organisation in 2000. The support has been provided in three phases. Phase one focused on build- ing the capacity of management in corporate planning, improving processes for carrying out work, and strength- ening economic statistics. Phase two concentrated on pro- viding support to the UBOS Board and management to im- plement their corporate plan, coordinate donor inputs and develop UBOS\u2019s role as coordinator of Uganda\u2019s statistical infrastructure. The current phase is part of a wider project to \u2018strengthen evidence-based decision-making in Uganda\u2019. This aims to improve the accountability of the Government of Uganda by strengthening monitoring and evaluation arrangements for the poverty eradication action plan and promoting poverty analysis to support policy and budget decisions. At the request of UBOS, a DFID statistics adviser is based part-time in the office. Their role is to support this work, pro- vide technical advice, and assist in the coordination of donor activities as UBOS moves to joint donor funding rather than discrete project inputs. Pooling our support to statistics in Tanzania In Tanzania, we have historically provided technical support to individual statistical activities including the census, house- hold budget survey and national accounts. however, Tanzania has now developed plans to strengthen statistical activities across the whole of government through its poverty monitor- ing master plan (PMMP). This responds to the need for informa- tion to plan and monitor policies related to Tanzania\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy. The PMMP is funded by pooling resources from six development partners (Denmark, the Neth- erlands, Norway, Switzerland, the UK and the EC) along with funding from the Tanzanian government. Since 2001, DFID has contributed GBP 1 million annually to this initiative. Pooled funding enables money to be directed more towards Tanza- nia\u2019s own priorities than to the needs of individual donors. \u2018The principle of DFID\u2019s support to statistical capacity building is that we take a holistic approach\u2019, says Julia Bunting.

        "Supporting the reform and restructuring of statistics in Pakistan DFID is currently developing a programme of up to GBP 5 million over three to five years to strengthen the Govern- ment of Pakistan\u2019s Statistics Division. The government has initiated a process of reform and restructuring which will see the three departments of the Statistics Division (the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the Population Census Organisation and the Agriculture Census Organisation) merge into a new Paki- stan Bureau of Statistics. The DFID programme plans to sup- port the government with the reforms needed to establish a functioning and efficient Bureau of Statistics. The reforms will include: revising statistical legislation, policies and regu- lations; strengthening financial and human resource man- agement systems; modernising IT systems and data collec- tion and dissemination methods and strengthening staff training and professionalism. The reform programme aims to improve the credibility and availability of data to sup- port government policymaking and planning. The ultimate objective is to create a more transparent, accountable and effective government which is better able to meet the needs of the poor. Support to evidence-based decision-making in Bolivia In Bolivia, a middle-income country where we provide lim- ited financial assistance, DFID has been providing strategic support to the national statistical institute (INE) to imple- ment a project designed to reach out to decision-makers across the country. Rather than generate new information, this project has aimed to make existing information much more accessible to local users, by: \u00b7 printing large quantities of high-demand products, e.g. small-area population projections, a statistical atlas, municipal development indicators, and geographically disaggregated national accounts; \u00b7 producing visually attractive materials, such as wall- charts of municipal indicators, and posters on the MDGs; \u00b7 improving the website by consulting with users and implementing their recommendations; \u00b7 conducting two-day, active-learning, training workshops with delegations from all of the 327 municipalities; \u00b7 distributing a range of statistical materials at a national municipal fair. Our support to multilateral initiatives In addition to our bilateral support to countries, DFID also supports a number of the multilateral statistical capacity building initiatives which have begun over the last few years in response to the international community\u2019s recognition of the need for better development information. This includes support to: the Partnership In Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (Paris21) hosted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the In- ternational household Survey Network (IhSN) hosted by Paris21; the World Bank\u2019s Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB); the International Monetary Fund\u2019s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); the health Metrics Net- work (hMN) hosted by the World health Organisation (WhO); and, the statistics offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Education, Sci- entific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). DFID provides financial support and/or the secondment of staff to these initiatives. We also sit on a number of the boards and steering committees. Our support to all of these global initiatives aims to develop a comprehensive, coherent and relevant international statistical system that conforms to good statistical practice, improves harmonisation, and meets the evidence and monitoring and evaluation needs of developing countries and other stakeholders. The ultimate aim for all of DFID\u2019s support to statistical capac- ity building is the elimination of poverty. We believe that having good statistics, allied to appropriate government policies, can change things radically and for the better.

        "Statistics Sweden favours long-term \u2018twinning\u2019 projects S tatistics Sweden has exported services in the field of statistics since the early 1980s. The aim is to give support to developing countries and countries un- dergoing the transition from planned to market economies in building up and developing their statistical systems. Statistics Sweden\u2019s staff take part in consultancy activities and provide expert advice and knowledge development in the partner coun- tries. Statistics Sweden is active in more than 30 countries and their preferred way of working is through \u2018twinning\u2019. S tatistics Sweden\u2019s (SCB) international activities are ad- ministered by the International Consulting Office (ICO), which was formed in 1983 and is a department of the SCB. The ICO thus has almost 25 years of experience in inter- national consultancy work. The ICO has a staff of 12. The objective of the ICO is to market and carry out consultancy activities commercially within the field of the SCB\u2019s responsi- bilities in the international market. Clients or partners are pri- marily national statistical offices and ministries with their own statistical activities in developing countries and countries un- dergoing the transition from planned to market economies. The overall purpose of the export of services is: \u00b7 to strengthen the statistical systems in developing coun- tries and transition economies; \u00b7 to contribute towards Sweden\u2019s global development pol- icy (fair and sustainable global development); \u00b7 to enhance the good international reputation of Sweden and the SCB; \u00b7 to help develop the skills of SCB staff. ICO\u2019s turnover in 2005 amounted to around EUR 9 million. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) provided around 80 % of the funding. The remainder \u00a9 EC 77 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 77 12-04-2007 12:19:54 ",
        "came mainly from the EU, the Danish development agency (Danida), foreign aid agencies and UN bodies. Since June 2004, there has been a framework agreement ( F\u00f6ljsam ) between Sida and Statistics Sweden which covers all Sida-financed projects. The aim of the cooperation is to make use of the knowledge gained within the SCB\u2019s field of expertise in Swedish development cooperation. Some of the areas covered include efforts to: \u00b7 help build up infrastructure and capacity in the field of statistics in the partner countries; \u00b7 assist partner countries in the development, production, dissemination and use of statistics; \u00b7 support the partner countries\u2019 involvement in interna- tional statistical cooperation. It is intended that the SCB and Sida work together in seeking to develop and update the SCB\u2019s skills in areas of relevance to this activity. Active in more than 30 countries Statistics Sweden is active in some 30 countries, spread across the following regions: the Balkans (7), the Commonwealth of Independent States (8), Latin America and the Caribbean (6), Africa (5) and Asia (4). On average, there are around 16 persons working on long- term contracts and slightly over 400 short-term contracts performed by some 160 persons. Statistics Sweden also re- ceives 30\u201340 groups of persons on study trips each year. Statistics Sweden\u2019s staff are given the opportunity to work under different conditions and in new environments. Coop- eration activities also enhance their skills and give them a greater understanding of the conditions governing the pro- duction of statistics in different institutional and economic situations. In recent years, the ICO has placed an emphasis on renewing its circle of consultants. In 2006, 15 persons left on trainee- ships and around 25 left to take up their first short-term con- tracts for the ICO. Twinning preferable Statistics Sweden prefers to work in so-called \u2018institutional cooperation\u2019. Institutional cooperation is considered to be long-term cooperation with a sister organisation in anoth- er country. Cooperation fosters close relations between the offices and between individual officials and experts in both countries. The beneficiary body can count on having access to experts in all fields of statistics. An important ele- ment of institutional cooperation is the priority given to the transfer of knowledge so that the beneficiary body it- self can, in the long run, conduct further activities without any assistance. Two important components in Statistics Sweden\u2019s coopera- tion model are: to use one or more long-term consultants on site in the beneficiary country and to use short-term consult- ants, who offer specialist knowledge in a specific area on site in the beneficiary country for a period ranging from a few days to a few weeks. Other components are study visits and training and having a project coordinator back home respon- sible for coordination between the project and the SCB.

        "The Swedish experience in Vietnam: a success story I n June 1994, the Government of Sweden agreed to sup- port the Government of Vietnam\u2019s ongoing economic reform programme with some projects aimed at improv- ing the effectiveness of the reforms. A project for support to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO) was final- ised in 1995, and later in the year Statistics Sweden (SCB) was contracted as the institutional consultant. Three project phases were implemented in the period 1995\u2013 2005, where the immediate objective remained \u2018Timely sup- ply of economic statistical information of appropriate quality and in cost-efficient forms\u2019. In this period, SCB assigned a team leader and additional long-term advisors to GSO and facilitat- ed short-term technical assistance. Study tours and interna- tional meetings have been financed and training courses in English and specific subject matters have been provided. GSO established a project steering committee with overall responsibility for the project. The day-to-day management was taken care of by the GSO project administrator in close cooperation with the SCB team leader and the subject mat- ter departments concerned. The Sida-supported projects at GSO have been very success- ful. The evaluation team has reached a positive conclusion in the assessment of project achievements in relation to each of the five standard evaluation criteria: relevance, effective- ness, impact, efficiency and sustainability. Promoted openness and democracy As regards relevance, the project objectives are in line with the objectives of the Vietnamese Government and society at large, especially the business sector, which demand good economic statistics. It has addressed important problems defined by GSO. The projects have supported Vietnam\u2019s transformation to a market-based economy, which in turn is a major cause of the economic growth that is responsible for most poverty reduc- tion, which is the overall goal for Sida. They contribute to one of Sida\u2019s specific goals, promoting openness and democracy, because public statistics are part of the \u2019infrastructure\u2019 of a modern democratic society. Key economic data rapidly released When it comes to effectiveness, the immediate objective has also been achieved; GSO now provides timely economic data of appropriate quality. Key economic statistics are rapidly available from GSO. They are available with a one- to two-month delay on the GSO website. The quality has been considerably improved. The price indexes have been updated with technical assistance from SCB. GSO now uses an international classification based on a commonly-used UN nomenclature. A business register developed with assistance from SCB is a valid frame for the economic surveys that include the multitude of new small enterprises. With assistance from SCB, GSO has developed its capacity to conduct sample surveys \u2014 the only practical and cost-efficient way to collect data from households as well as from small private enterprises. The project has provided assistance for gender specification of statistics and more gender-specific statistics are now produced by GSO. The IT component has been essential for GSO\u2019s develop- ment. The technical assistance has contributed to strength- ening the capacity of GSO staff and developing an IT strat- egy, which has saved GSO from the mistakes made by other institutions, and which is a sound basis for further develop- ment of the IT infrastructure with funds from government as well as from other donors. In addition to training in statistical subject matters the project has contributed to English language training, which enables GSO to benefit from international sources. The projects have supported Vietnam\u2019s transformation to a market-based economy, which, in turn, is a major cause of the economic growth responsible for most poverty reduction.

        "All in all, GSO is now a modern statistical institution in line with the UN principles for official statistics in juridical as well as in practical terms. The evaluation team has concluded that the positive result de- scribed cannot be attributed to the Sida-supported projects alone, but that fewer results would have been achieved without the support. Thus, the Sida-supported projects have contributed considerably to the positive results achieved. Statistics reach policymakers and planners With reference to impact, the development objective is im- plicitly defined as better management of the economy and better economic policymaking. The improved statistical in- formation produced by GSO is, in other words, expected to contribute to decisions based on factual information. Based on interviews with stakeholders, the team has concluded that the improved statistics from GSO reach policymakers and planners, and that they base policies, plans and pro- grammes on these statistics. An important and partly unexpected positive effect has also been identified. The evaluation team has found that GSO has become a learning organisation in the sense that GSO has developed its ability to analyse its problems and to find solu- tions. GSO is also quite experienced in learning from techni- cal advisors and from statistical institutions, adapting it to a Vietnamese context and applying it. A knowledge of English and the IT infrastructure in place are important precondi- tions for this enhanced learning ability. At the overall level, when compared to similar projects, it is the assessment of the evaluation team that Sida\u2019s support to GSO has been efficient. Finally regarding sustainability, the GSO project steering com- mittee has taken great care to ensure that the technical assist- ance has been used for capacity building. Due to this, GSO is now able to continue the use of the methods it has learned. Financial sustainability has been improved through govern- ment\u2019s increased willingness to provide resources to GSO. Twinning is successful One lesson to be learned is that the GSO-SCB twinning project seems to have been in line with the general experi- ence that twinning is successful for building up professional skills in specific statistical fields. Another lesson is that the relatively massive provision of IT equipment gave the project the possibility of establishing an overall IT strategy for GSO. The project\u2019s comprehensive ap- proach has ensured that GSO\u2019s later investments in IT have been rational and it has saved GSO from a piecemeal and unsystematic approach to investment in IT, which has been costly to many organisations. This text is based on Statistics Sweden\u2019s summary of a report written by an evaluation team financed by Sida. The General Statistics Office of Vietnam now provides timely economic data of appropriate quality. The statistics reach policymakers and planners who base policies, plans and programmes on these statistics.

        "Working miracles in Cyprus N icosia is one of the world\u2019s oldest cities. Known in ancient times as Ledra, it was the centre of an independent kingdom as early as the 7th century BC. Nicosia is the capital of Cyprus which became an independent state in 1960. The Statisti- cal Service of Cyprus (Cystat) is located in a building that also houses the services of the Ministry of Finance, just outside Nicosia\u2019s old city walls. S igma was welcomed warmly by the Director of Cystat, Mr Pambis Philippides, who has devoted his entire career to statistics. he joined the Statistical Service of Cyprus in 1971, climbed in the hierarchy and was appointed Director in 1998. The EU \u2014 a turning point \u2018Our vision is to produce timely and good-quality statistics to satisfy the widest range of users in Cyprus, in the EU and internationally\u2019, Mr Philippides says right from the start. A new momentum for Cyprus statistics was created well be- fore joining the EU, when the negotiations began in 1998. Statistics gradually became a daily reference and Cystat began to play a more important role in society. About 75 % of the statistical data produced today by Cystat are based on new demands due to EU membership, including ma- jor adjustments of previous work. Various EU projects and grants have facilitated the compliance efforts and improved Cystat\u2019s capacity to work more efficiently. \u2018 Despite the stress experienced since then, I can say without reservation that the image of Cystat and the usefulness of statistics has been more appreciated and greatly upgraded due to the accession process and of course by joining the EU,\u2019 says Mr Philippides. The recognition of users \u2018In recent years, Cystat has made good progress on timeli- ness. We have replaced volumes of paper with timely and reliable data, Cyprus is now the first among the EU-27 to submit the earliest government deficit data to Eurostat. Today we comply almost fully with EU requirements con- cerning the production of harmonised statistics\u2019, says Mr Philippides. A particular strength of Cystat is its workforce: the office has promoted good personal and professional relations among the staff and has succeeded in attracting young statisticians and economists. The Director of the Statistical Service of Cyprus, Mr Pambis Philippides: \u2018We have managed to create a wider statistical culture among Cypriot society in general\u2019. 81 SIGMA 01 07 sigma_EN.indd 81 12-04-2007 12:20:09 ",
        "\u2018Thanks to a joint effort of all staff, we have managed to cre- ate a wider statistical culture among the Cyprus society in general, improving the coordination and cooperation with all stakeholders. Results are encouraging. It is a process of continuous improvement\u2019, he says. As a result, the Statistical Service has a very good public image and enjoys the recognition of policymakers, govern- ment officials, the private sector, academia and the press, as reflected in the user satisfaction survey of the Cyprus statisti- cal system conducted in summer 2006. Focusing on timeliness of data Cystat\u2019s dissemination policy is based on the principles of free-of-charge supply of data, quick and simultaneous re- lease of statistics to all users, user-friendliness and compre- hensiveness of information. The electronic dissemination of data, focusing on timeliness and the immediate release of data, has been a priority area in the past couple of years. The improvement has been felt and highly rated by 90 % of the users who responded to the survey. Membership of the EU has played a major role towards this release practice, given the tight submission deadlines to Eurostat. The Cystat website remains the main source of data for most users. Recently upgraded, it is available in Greek and Eng- lish, and features daily press releases, electronic reports, ar- ticles and online services such as alert e-mail whenever new data are published and an online order service. In addition anonymous micro-data are also provided to academic and other scientific institutions, for research purposes. For lack of a full-blown press office, the publication of press releases is managed by the respective production unit, fol- lowing a pre-established calendar. The contact point for ques- tions from journalists, TV and news agencies is the Director, who also shares this role with the heads of the specific subject divisions, as needed. Small country\u2019s burden As a small country, with a matching young and small sta- tistical office of 145 staff, the Statistical Service of Cyprus faces several challenges. It has the same obligations as all EU Member States, both in terms of number and quality of statistics, as well as commitments concerning participa- tion to meetings and representation vis-\u00e0-vis other Member States and international bodies. The burden on small countries is much higher. Firstly, due to the limited human resources: the number of staff is Cystat\u2019s major problem, particularly now that Cyprus has EU obliga- tions. Given the workload, Mr Philippides describes the job performed by the staff as a \u2018miracle\u2019. Secondly, the statistical burden on the private sector is con- tinuous. Businesses are continuously contacted for survey data, either on a monthly or annual basis. The coverage for some of the different surveys varies between 10 000 to 15 000 enterprises, out of the total 60 000 enterprises in Cyprus. \u2018We would like a prioritisation and simplification of proce- dures for all statistical requirements and certain derogations concerning the detail and amount of data produced by small countries. Some distinction should be made in the EU de- pending on the size of the country and that the particulari- ties of small countries should receive special attention when discussing technical issues.\u2019 \u2018I can say without reservation that the image of Cystat and the usefulness of statistics have been more appreciated and greatly upgraded due to the accession process and of course by joining the EU\u2019, says Mr Philippides.

        "Another proposal is to exploit the Europe first approach bet- ter. Do we really need all European statistics at national level? Could we do with some European aggregates for given sec- tors? Take for instance, the carriage of goods by road which is more or less a continuous survey. In Cyprus, the longest distance is 200 km, so the national weight in an overall EU figure would be negligible. Closer cooperation within the ESS As for the cooperation with Eurostat and other Member States, Mr Philippides would like to see more dialogue and more soli- darity among Member States. Best practices and technical ex- pertise should be shared and be made available to technically less advanced countries. Eurostat could have a great role to play, either as facilitator or as a provider of expertise. International issues at Cystat Sigma also met the head of International Relations, Mr George Georgiou. he is responsible for industry and busi- ness statistics, as well as new fields such as environment, R & D and innovation, which were set up after Cyprus com- menced accession negotiations to the EU. Mr Georgiou devotes a little over 5 % of his time to inter- national relations, mainly representing Cyprus in meetings abroad. Only in June 2006 was a young officer assigned to work exclusively on international relations and European matters, Ms Maria Poupa. \u2018Being employed in a small statistical office like Cystat is a mixed blessing.

        "ject fields. Every day poses a new challenge. On the other hand, it is stressful and difficult to study a subject in depth, compared to when you work on a specific domain and know everything about it\u2019, Mr Georgiou says. When asking him about the lessons learned from the acces- sion process Mr Georgiou says: \u2018There is just one road. You have to check what is already in place and implement what is needed. What was very helpful during the pre-accession period was to be invited as observers to all Eurostat working groups and various multi-country pilot projects from an early stage and the on-the-job training in NSIs of various Member States. The whole office, 100 people back then, was involved in the process. In 2006, we are almost fully compliant with the basic regulations.\u2019 \u2018Changes brought by EU accession have been substantial, both in the statistics produced and how they are produced (methodological aspect), and in the needs of users, who now want to compare national statistics with EU data\u2019, he adds. Crucial challenges for the future The biggest challenge ahead for both Mr Philippides and Mr Georgiou is to change the status of the Statistical Service to full autonomy, totally independent of any ministry. The resource issues should improve with the approval of more permanent posts for Cystat and its IT system will be fully restructured as from October 2006, to bring it to the same working environment as other NSIs. In addition, although the first Cyprus Presidency of the EU is only planned for the second half of 2012, preparations should already start in order to make it a success. Finally, Mr Philippides expresses a hope: to reach a political solution for the Cyprus issue in the near future. \u2018Not only for a reunited country, but also for the statistics of the whole Cyprus. Right now, the EU acquis is only applicable in the Government Controlled Area of the Republic of Cyprus. The statistics compiled by Cystat refer only to this part of the country, while for the other area only estimates on popula- tion can be made\u2019, he says. Loukia Makri has been a statistics officer in the Statistical Service of Cyprus since 2001. A passion for social statistics Loukia studied social statistics and worked in the private sector for four years. In 2000, she applied for a post at the Statistical Service and was appointed to work in the health statistics division. The field, she explains, has been constant- ly evolving in recent years, requiring the transition from a national administrative data collection process to the use of multiple and complex data collection methods, the com- bination of different sources and the introduction of new systems and methodological tools. One major challenge ex- pected to be faced in the near future is the introduction of EU legislation in this field. Has the job lived up to your expectations? \u2018To the maximum. First, health statistics is one of my main statistical interests. Through my job I have also been able to attend several meetings and workshops abroad and have had the chance to exchange experiences and share interests with colleagues from other EU Member States.\u2019 \u2018I have been also involved with the coordination of EU-fund- ed projects, in particular Phare 2002, Eurostat grants and transition facilities 2004 and 2005.

Although it is a much larger service now, it still main- tains its small office character and its close staff relations. The majority of statistical staff are university graduates and the average age is below 45. It is indeed a highly professional and pleasant environment to work in.\u2019 How do you see your future in the statistical office? \u2018During the five years that I have worked in Cystat, I was given a lot of opportunities to enhance my academic knowledge and to enrich my work experience. I would like to be able to continue this personal growth and develop- ment in the future. I definitely see myself working in the social statistics field which is my main interest and field of study.\u2019 \u2018Another challenge I expect to face at personal level, is my involvement in the field of demographic statistics. This has been recently decided and it is a change that I strongly welcome, as I consider demographic statistics one of the main cornerstones of national statistics.\u2019 What changes or improvement would you like to implement in the office? \u2018One of the main constraints that we currently experience is the limited number of staff in relation to national and EU needs. User needs keep increasing and certain topics are not covered at present, such as statistics on disabilities, health- care in the private sector etc. These areas will have to be tackled in the near future in order to satisfy user needs.\u2019 \u2018The heavy workload and tight deadlines can sometimes be an advantage since the limited number of staff has to be- come involved in several fields of work, thus enabling one to enrich his/her knowledge and skills. however, it can also constitute a drawback as it increases the burden and adds extra pressure on the employee in order to keep up with deadlines. Such intense time schedules clearly do not allow for in-depth specialisation in one\u2019s field of interest.\u2019 \u2018As a young statistician, I usually feel the need for stronger links with academia and the research world. Although there are currently some opportunities in the research field, it would be an advantage to establish relationships further between the Statistical Service and universities or other academic or- ganisations for the production of research work. This, I believe is an issue already in the future policy plans of Cystat.\u2019 building bridges building bridges 85 SIGMA SIGMA 01 07 07 sigma_EN.indd 85 12-04-2007 12:20:17 ",
