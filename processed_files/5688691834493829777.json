        "COMMON POSITION (EC) No 28/2006 adopted by the Council on 23 October 2006 with a view to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No \u2026/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (2006/C 301 E/02) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO- PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Com- munity, and in particular Article 179(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 1 ), Whereas: (1) A new framework for planning and delivering assistance is proposed in order to make the Community's external assistance more effective. Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 ( 2 ) establishes an Instrument for Pre Accession (IPA) for Community assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries. Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] ( 3 ) lays down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Council Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] ( 4 ) establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories. Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] ( 5 ) establishes an instrument for stability. Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] ( 6 ) establishes an instru- ment for nuclear safety cooperation. Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] ( 7 ) establishes a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 ( 8 ) concerns huma- nitarian aid. This Regulation establishes a financing instrument for development cooperation providing direct support for the Community's development coop- eration policy. (2) The Community pursues a development cooperation policy aimed at achieving the objectives of poverty reduction, sustainable economic and social development and the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy. (3) The Community pursues a cooperation policy that fosters cooperation, partnerships and joint undertakings between economic players in the Community and partner countries and regions, and promotes dialogue between political, economic and social partners in rele- vant sectors. (4) The Community's development cooperation policy and international action are guided by the Millennium Devel- opment Goals (MDGs), such as the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 8 September 2000, and the main development objectives and principles approved by the Community and its Member States in the context of the United Nations (UN) and other competent international organisations in the field of development cooperation. (5) With a view to policy coherence for development, it is important that Community non-development policies assist developing countries' efforts in achieving the MDGs in line with Article 178 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. (6) A political environment which guarantees peace and stability, respect for human rights, fundamental free- doms, democratic principles, the rule of law, good governance and gender equality is fundamental to long- term development. (7) Sound and sustainable economic policies are a prerequi- site for development. (8) The members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) committed themselves at the 4th Ministerial Conference in Doha to mainstreaming trade in development strate- gies and to providing trade-related technical and capa- city-building assistance as well as the necessary measures seeking to facilitate the transfer of technology through and for trade, to enhance the relationship between foreign direct investment and trade, and the mutual interrelation of trade and environment, and to help developing countries take part in new trade negotiations and implement their results. 12.12.2006 C 301E/51 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Opinion of the European Parliament of 18 May 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal), Council Common Position of 23 October 2006 and Position of the European Parliament of \u2026 (not yet published in the Official Journal).

        "(9) The Joint Statement by the Council and the Representa- tives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on European Union Development Policy: \u2018The European Consensus\u2019 ( 1 ), of 20 December 2005, and any subsequent modifications thereto, provides the general framework for action by the Community on development matters. It should steer the planning and implementation of the development assistance and coop- eration strategies. (10) Development cooperation should be implemented through geographic and thematic programmes. Geographic programmes should support the develop- ment of, and reinforce the cooperation with, countries and regions in Latin America, Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Africa. (11) The Community and its Member States have concluded partnership and cooperation agreements with some of these partner countries and regions aimed at making a significant contribution to the long-term development of the partner countries and the wellbeing of their people. The essential elements on which these partnership and cooperation agreements are based are the common and universal values of respect for, and promotion of, human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic princi- ples and the rule of law. In this context, attention should also be given to the right to decent work and the rights of people with disabilities. The pursuit and deepening of bilateral relations between the Community and partner countries and the consolidation of multilateral institu- tions are important factors in making a significant contribution to balancing and developing the world economy and also in strengthening the Community's and partner countries' and regions' role and place in the world. (12) While thematic programmes should primarily support developing countries, two beneficiary countries as well as the overseas countries and territories (OCTs), whose characteristics do not meet the requirements to be defined as Official Development Assistance (ODA) reci- pients by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD/DAC) and which are covered by Article 2(4), second subparagraph, first indent, should also be eligible for thematic programmes under the conditions set out in this Regulation. The Community should finance thematic programmes in countries, terri- tories and regions eligible for assistance under a geographic programme provided for under this Regu- lation, for assistance under Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] or for geographic cooperation in accordance with the Euro- pean Development Fund (EDF). Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community (\u2018Overseas Association Deci- sion\u2019) ( 2 ), which is applicable until 31 December 2011, lays down the conditions for the eligibility of OCTs for the thematic activities of development assistance funded by the general budget of the European Union, which are not altered by this Regulation. (13) Thematic programmes should provide distinctive added value and complement programmes of a geographic nature, which constitute the main framework for Com- munity cooperation with third countries. Development cooperation implemented through thematic programmes should be subsidiary to the geographic programmes set out in this Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] and to cooperation under the EDF. Thematic programmes encompass a specific area of activity of interest to a group of partner countries not determined by geography, or cooperation activities addressed to various regions or groups of partner countries, or an international operation that is not geographically specific. They also have an important role in developing Community policies externally and ensuring sectoral consistency and visibility. (14) Thematic programmes should support actions in the areas of human and social development, environment and sustainable management of natural resources, including energy, non-State actors and local authorities, food security and migration and asylum. The contents of the thematic programmes have been prepared on the basis of the corresponding communications from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council. (15) The thematic programme on the environment and the sustainable management of resources, including energy should, inter alia , promote international environmental governance and Community environmental and energy policies abroad. (16) The thematic programme on migration and asylum should contribute to the realisation of the objective set out in the Conclusions of the European Council held in Brussels on 15 and 16 December 2005, namely to inten- sify Community financial assistance in areas concerning or related to migration in respect of its relations with third countries. (17) Community policy on food security has evolved towards supporting broad-based food security strategies at national, regional and global level, limiting the use of food aid to humanitarian situations and food crises and avoiding disruptive effects on local production and markets, and needs to take into account the specific situation of countries that are structurally fragile and highly dependent on support for food security, in order to avoid a steep reduction of Community assistance to these countries. 12.12.2006 C 301E/52 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ C 46, 24.2.2006, p. 1. ( 2 ) OJ L 314, 30.11.2001, p. 1. ",
        "(18) In line with the Council Conclusions of 24 May 2005 actions should be supported to improve reproductive and sexual health in developing countries and to secure respect for the rights relating thereto; financial assistance and appropriate expertise should be provided with a view to promoting a holistic approach to, and the recog- nition of, reproductive and sexual health and rights as defined in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), including safe motherhood and universal access to a comprehensive range of safe and reliable reproductive and sexual health care and services. When cooperation measures are implemented, the decisions adopted at the ICPD must be rigorously observed, where relevant. (19) Following up on Regulation (EC) No 266/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2006 establishing accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime ( 1 ), assistance to ACP Sugar Protocol coun- tries affected by the reform of the Common Market Organisation for sugar should also be provided and aim at supporting their adjustment process. (20) In implementing the Community's development policy, more effective aid, greater complementarity and better harmonisation, alignment and coordination of proce- dures, both between the Community and its Member States and in relations with other donors and develop- ment actors, are essential to ensuring the consistency and relevance of aid whilst at the same time reducing the costs borne by partner countries as approved in the Declaration on Aid Effectiveness adopted by the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Paris, on 2 March 2005. (21) In order to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, it is necessary to pursue a differentiated approach depending on development contexts and needs, supporting partner countries or regions with specific, tailor-made programmes, based on their own needs, strategies, prio- rities and assets. (22) The key to the success of development policies is whether the partner countries take ownership of the development strategies, and, to this end, the greatest possible involvement of all sections of society, including disabled people and other vulnerable groups, should be encouraged. With a view to ensuring efficiency and transparency and encouraging countries to take owner- ship, donors' cooperation strategies and implementation procedures should, where possible, be aligned on those of the partner countries. (23) Taking into consideration the need to ensure effective bridging between humanitarian relief and long-term development assistance, measures eligible under Regu- lation (EC) No [\u2026] should not, in principle, be funded under this Regulation, except where there is a need to ensure continuity of cooperation from crisis to stable conditions for development. (24) Untying aid in line with best practices of the OECD/ DAC is a key factor in adding value to aid and in building local capacity. Rules on participation in tenders and grant contracts, as well as rules concerning the origin of supplies should be set down in accordance with most recent developments concerning the untying of aid. (25) Assistance should be managed in accordance with the rules for external aid contained in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 2 ), with due provisions aimed at protecting the financial interests of the Com- munity. Continued efforts should be made to improve the implementation of development cooperation to achieve a sound balance between financial resources allocated and absorption capacity, as well as to reduce outstanding commitments. (26) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the period 2007-2013 constituting the prime reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of Point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 3 ). (27) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 4 ). Programming documents and some specific implementation measures should be adopted by the management committee procedure. 12.12.2006 C 301E/53 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ L 50, 21.2.2006, p. 1.

        "(28) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the proposed cooperation with developing countries, terri- tories and regions that are not Community Member States and are not eligible for Community aid under Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 or Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Com- munity may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportion- ality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives. (29) This Regulation makes it necessary to repeal the current set of Regulations, in view of the restructuring of the external action instruments, notably in the field of devel- opment cooperation, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Overall purpose and scope 1. The Community shall finance measures aimed at supporting cooperation with developing countries, territories and regions included in the list of aid recipients of the Develop- ment Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/DAC), and set out in Annex I (hereinafter referred to as \u2018partner countries and regions\u2019). The Commission shall amend Annex I in accordance with regular OECD/DAC reviews of its list of aid recipients and inform the European Parliament and the Council thereof. 2. The Community shall finance thematic programmes in countries, territories and regions eligible for assistance under a geographic programme of this Regulation, set out in Articles 5 to 10, for assistance under Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] or for geographic cooperation under the European Development Fund (EDF). 3. For the purposes of this Regulation, a region is defined as a geographical entity comprising more than one developing country. TITLE I OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES Article 2 Objectives 1. The primary and overarching objective of cooperation under this Regulation shall be the eradication of poverty in partner countries and regions in the context of sustainable development, including pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as well as the promotion of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and for the rule of law. Consistently with this objective, cooperation with partner countries and regions shall: \u2014 consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, good governance, gender equality and related instruments of international law; \u2014 foster the sustainable development \u2014 including political, economic, social and environmental aspects \u2014 of partner countries and regions, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them; \u2014 encourage their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy; \u2014 help develop international measures to preserve and improve the quality of the environment and the sustainable management of global natural resources, in order to ensure sustainable development, including addressing climate change and biodiversity loss; and \u2014 strengthen the relationship between the Community and partner countries and regions. 2. Community cooperation under this Regulation shall comply with the commitments and objectives in the field of development cooperation that the Community has approved in the context of the United Nations (UN) and other competent international organisations in the field of development coopera- tion. 3. Community development policy, as laid down in Title XX of the Treaty, shall provide the legal framework for cooperation with partner countries and regions. The Joint Statement by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on European Union Develop- ment Policy: \u2018The European Consensus\u2019, of 20 December 2005, and any subsequent modifications thereto, shall provide the general framework, orientations and focus to steer the imple- mentation of Community cooperation with partner countries and regions under this Regulation. 4. Measures referred to in Article 1(1) shall be designed so as to fulfil the criteria for Official Development Assistance (ODA) established by the OECD/DAC. Programmes referred to in Article 1(2) shall be designed so as to fulfil the criteria for ODA established by the OECD/DAC, unless: \u2014 the characteristics of the beneficiary require otherwise, or \u2014 the programme implements a global initiative, a com- munity policy priority or an international obligation or commitment of the Community, as referred to in Article 11(2), and the measure does not have the character- istics to fulfil such criteria. 12.12.2006 C 301E/54 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "At least 90 % of the expenditure foreseen under thematic programmes shall be designed so as to fulfil the criteria for ODA established by the OECD/DAC, without prejudice to Article 2(4), second subparagraph, first indent. 5. Community assistance under this Regulation shall not be used to finance the procurement of arms or ammunition, and operations having military or defence implications. 6. Measures covered by Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] and in par- ticular Article 4 thereof, and eligible for funding thereunder shall not, in principle, be funded under this Regulation, except where there is a need to ensure continuity of cooperation from crisis to stable conditions for development. Without prejudice to the need to ensure continuity of coopera- tion from crisis to stable conditions for development, measures covered by, and eligible for funding under, Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid ( 1 ), shall not be funded under this Regulation. Article 3 General principles 1. The Community is founded on the values of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental free- doms and seeks to develop and consolidate commitment to these values in partner countries and regions through dialogue and cooperation. 2. In the implementation of this Regulation, a differentiated approach depending on development contexts and needs shall be pursued so that partner countries or regions are provided with specific, tailor-made cooperation, based on their own needs, strategies, priorities and assets. Least developed countries and low income countries shall be given priority in terms of overall resource allocation in order to achieve the MDGs. Appropriate attention shall be given to support the pro-poor development of middle income countries, particularly the lower middle income countries many of which face problems similar to those of low income countries. 3. Mainstreaming of the following cross-cutting issues shall be undertaken in all programmes: the promotion of human rights, gender equality, democracy, good governance, the rights of the child and indigenous peoples' rights, environmental sustainability and combating HIV/AIDS.

The Community shall take account of the objectives laid down in Title XX of the Treaty and in Article 2 of this Regu- lation, in all policies which are likely to affect partner countries and regions. For measures financed under this Regulation, the Community shall also aim to ensure coherence with other areas of its external action. This shall be ensured in formulating policy, strategic planning and the programming and implemen- tation of measures. 5. The Community and the Member States shall improve coordination and complementarity of their policies on develop- ment cooperation by responding to partner countries' and regions' priorities at country and regional level. Community policy in the sphere of development cooperation shall be complementary to the policies pursued by the Member States. 6. The Commission and the Member States shall seek regular and frequent exchanges of information, including with other donors, and promote better donor coordination and complementarity by working towards joint multiannual programming, based on partner countries' poverty reduction or equivalent strategies and partner countries' own budget processes, by common implementation mechanisms including shared analysis, by joint donor-wide missions and by the use of co-financing arrangements. 7. Within their respective spheres of competence, the Com- munity and the Member States shall promote a multilateral approach to global challenges and foster cooperation with multilateral and regional organisations and bodies such as inter- national financial institutions, UN agencies, funds and programmes, and other bilateral donors. 8. The Community shall promote effective cooperation with partner countries and regions in line with international best practice.

Coordination shall take place in partner countries and regions using agreed guide- lines and best practice principles on coordination and aid effectiveness; (e) an MDG profile in Country Strategy Papers and in its multi- annual programming. 9. The Commission shall inform and have regular exchanges of views with the European Parliament. 10. The Commission shall seek regular exchanges of infor- mation with civil society. TITLE II GEOGRAPHIC AND THEMATIC PROGRAMMES Article 4 Implementation of Community assistance Consistently with the overall purpose and scope, objectives and general principles of this Regulation, Community assistance shall be implemented through geographic and thematic programmes set out in Articles 5 to 16 and the programme set out in Article 17.

The procedure referred to in Article 35(2) need not be used for amendments to special measures, such as those making technical adjustments, extending the implementation period, reassigning funds within the forecast budget, or increasing or reducing the size of the budget by less than 20 % of the initial budget, provided these amendments do not affect the initial objectives set out in the Commission decision. Any such technical adjustments shall be communicated within one month to the European Parliament and to the Member States. Article 24 Eligibility 1.

Article 25 Types of financing 1. Community financing may take the following forms: (a) projects and programmes; (b) budget support if the partner country's management of public spending is sufficiently transparent, reliable and effective, and where it has put in place properly formu- lated sectoral or macroeconomic policies positively assessed by its principal donors; including, where relevant, the international financial institutions. The Commission shall consistently use an approach based on results and performance indicators and shall clearly define and monitor its conditionality and support efforts of partner countries to develop parliamentary control and audit capa- cities and to increase transparency and public access to information. Disbursement of budgetary support shall be conditional on satisfactory progress towards achieving the objectives in terms of impact and results; (c) sectoral support; (d) in exceptional cases, sectoral and general import programmes, which may take the form of: (i) sectoral import programmes in kind; (ii) sectoral import programmes providing foreign exchange to finance imports for the sector in question; or (iii) general import programmes providing foreign exchange to finance general imports of a wide range of products; (e) funds made available to the EIB or other financial interme- diaries on the basis of Commission programmes for the purpose of providing loans (in particular to support invest- ment in and development of the private sector), risk capital (in the form of subordinated or conditional loans) or other temporary minority holdings in business capital, and contributions to guarantee funds in accordance with Article 32, to the extent that the financial risk of the Com- munity is limited to these funds; (f) interest-rate subsidies, especially for environment related loans; (g) debt-relief, under internationally agreed debt relief programmes; (h) grants to finance projects submitted by entities of the type listed in Article 24(1)(b), (c), (d), (f) and (g)(i) to (v); (i) grants to finance the operating costs of entities of the type listed in Article 24(1)(b), (c), (d), (f) and (g)(i), (iii) and (iv); (j) funding for twinning programmes between public institu- tions, local authorities, national public bodies or private- law entities entrusted with public service tasks of a Member State and those of a partner country or region; (k) contributions to international funds, such as those managed by international or regional organisations; (l) contributions to national funds set up by partner countries and regions to attract joint financing from a number of donors, or contributions to funds set up by one or more donors for the purpose of the joint implementation of projects; 12.12.2006 C 301E/69 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

Community assistance shall not be used for paying taxes, duties or charges in beneficiary countries. Article 26 Support measures 1. Community financing may cover expenditure associated with the preparation, follow up, monitoring, audit and evalua- tion activities directly necessary for the implementation of this Regulation and the achievement of its objectives, e.g. studies, meetings, information, awareness-raising, training and publica- tion activities, expenditure associated with computer networks for the exchange of information, and any other administrative or technical assistance expenditure necessary for the manage- ment of the programme. It shall also cover expenditure at Commission delegations on the administrative support needed to manage operations financed under this Regulation. 2. These support measures are not necessarily covered by multiannual indicative programmes and may therefore be financed outside the scope of strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes. However, they may also be financed under multiannual indicative programmes. The Commission shall adopt support measures not covered by the multiannual indicative programmes in accordance with Article 23(3) and (4). Article 27 Co-financing 1. Measures shall be eligible for co-financing from the following, inter alia : (a) Member States and their regional and local authorities, and in particular their public and para-Statal agencies; (b) other donor countries, and in particular their public and para-Statal agencies; (c) international organisations, including regional organisa- tions, and in particular international and regional financial institutions; (d) companies, firms, other private organisations and busi- nesses, and other non-State actors; (e) partner countries and regions in receipt of funding. 2. In the case of parallel co-financing, the project or programme is split into a number of clearly identifiable compo- nents, which are each financed by the different partners providing co-financing in such a way that the end-use of the financing can always be identified. In the case of joint co-financing, the total cost of a project or programme is shared between the partners providing the co- financing and the resources are pooled in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify the source of financing for any given activity undertaken as part of the project or programme. 3. In the case of joint co-financing, the Commission may receive and manage funds on behalf of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (c) for the purpose of implementing joint measures. Such funds shall be treated as assigned revenue, in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. Article 28 Management procedures 1. The measures financed under this Regulation shall be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and any revision thereof. 2. In the event of co-financing and in other duly justified cases, the Commission may entrust tasks of public authority, and in particular budget implementation tasks, to the bodies referred to in Article 54(2)(c) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. 3. In the case of decentralised management, the Commission may decide to use the procurement or grant procedures of the beneficiary partner country or region after verifying that they respect the relevant criteria of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, provided that: \u2014 the procedures of the beneficiary partner country or region satisfy the principles of transparency, proportionality, equal treatment and non-discrimination and prevent any conflict of interests, \u2014 the beneficiary partner country or region undertakes to check regularly that the operations financed by the General Budget of the European Union have been properly imple- mented, to take appropriate measures to prevent irregulari- ties and fraud, and, if necessary, to take legal action to recover unduly paid funds. 12.12.2006 C 301E/70 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

They shall also expressly authorise the Commission to carry out on-the- spot checks and inspections as provided for in Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96. 3. All contracts resulting from the implementation of assis- tance shall ensure the rights of the Commission and the Court of Auditors under paragraph 2 during and after the perfor- mance of the contracts.

Participation in the award of procurement or grant contracts financed under this Regulation shall also be open to all natural persons who are nationals of or legal persons who are established in any country other than those referred in paragraph 1, where reciprocal access to their external assistance has been established. Reciprocal access shall be granted whenever a country grants eligibility on equal terms to the Member States and to the reci- pient country concerned. Reciprocal access shall be established by means of a specific decision concerning a given country or a given regional group of countries. Such a decision shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 35(2) and shall be in force for a minimum period of one year. 12.12.2006 C 301E/71 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1.

        "The granting of reciprocal access shall be based on a compar- ison between the Community and other donors and shall proceed at sectoral level, as defined by the OECD/DAC cate- gories, or at country level, whether it be a donor or a recipient country. The decision to grant such reciprocity to a donor country shall be based on the transparency, consistency and proportionality of the aid provided by that donor, including its qualitative and quantitative nature. The recipient countries shall be consulted as part of the procedure described in this para- graph. Reciprocal access in the least developed countries as defined by the OECD/DAC shall be automatically granted to OECD/DAC members. 3. Participation in the award of procurement or grant contracts financed under a Community instrument shall be open to international organisations. 4. The above is without prejudice to the participation of categories of eligible organisations by nature or by localisation in regard to the objectives of the action to carry out. 5. Experts may be of any nationality, without prejudice to the qualitative and financial requirements set out in the Community's procurement rules. 6. All supplies and materials purchased under a contract financed under this Regulation shall originate from the Com- munity or from an eligible country as defined in paragraph 1 and 2. The term \u2018origin\u2019 for the purpose of this Regulation is defined in the relevant Community legislation on rules of origin for customs purposes. 7. The Commission may, in duly substantiated cases, authorise the participation of natural and legal persons from countries having traditional economic, trade or geographical links with neighbouring countries or other third countries, and the use of supplies and materials of different origin. 8. The Commission may, in duly substantiated exceptional cases, authorise the participation of natural persons who are nationals of or legal persons who are established in other coun- tries than those referred to in paragraph 1 and 2, or the purchase of supplies and materials of different origins from that set out in paragraph 6. Derogations may be justified on the basis of the unavailability of products and services in the markets of the countries concerned, for reasons of extreme urgency, or if the eligibility rules would make the realisation of a project, a programme or an action impossible or exceedingly difficult. 9. Whenever Community funding covers an operation implemented through an international organisation, participa- tion in the appropriate contractual procedures shall be open to all natural or legal persons who are eligible pursuant to para- graph 1 and 2 as well as to all natural or legal persons who are eligible pursuant to the rules of that organisation, care being taken to ensure that equal treatment is afforded to all donors. The same rules shall apply in respect of supplies, materials and experts. Whenever Community funding covers an operation co-financed with a third country, subject to reciprocity as defined in para- graph 2, or with a regional organisation, or with a Member State, participation in the appropriate contractual procedures shall be open to all natural or legal persons who are eligible pursuant to paragraph 1, 2 and 3 as well as to all natural or legal persons who are eligible under the rules of such third country, regional organisation or Member State. The same rules shall apply in respect of supplies, materials and experts. 10. For the purposes of aid channelled directly through non- State actors under the thematic programme defined in Article 14, the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to the eligibility criteria established for the selection of grant benefici- aries. Beneficiaries of these grants shall abide by the rules established in this Article where the implementation of aid requires the award of procurement contracts. 11. In order to accelerate the eradication of poverty through the promotion of local capacities, markets and purchases, special consideration shall be given to local and regional procurement in partner countries. Tenderers who have been awarded contracts shall respect inter- nationally agreed core labour standards, e.g. the ILO core labour standards, conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of forced and compulsory labour, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour. Access by developing countries to Community assistance shall be rendered possible by all such technical assistance as is deemed appropriate. 12.12.2006 C 301E/72 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

The Commission shall adopt implementing provisions for paragraph 1 on a case-by-case basis to cover risk sharing, the remuneration of the intermediary responsible for implementa- tion, the use and recovery of profits on funds, and the closure of the operation. Article 33 Evaluation 1. The Commission shall regularly monitor and review its programmes, and evaluate the results of the implementation of geographical and thematic policies and programmes, and of sectoral policies and the effectiveness of programming, where appropriate by means of independent external evaluations, in order to ascertain whether the objectives have been met and enable it to formulate recommendations with a view to improving future operations. Proposals by the European Parlia- ment or the Council for independent external evaluations will be taken into due account. Particular attention shall be given to social sectors and to progress made towards achieving the MDGs. 2. The Commission shall send its evaluation reports to the European Parliament and to the Committee referred to in Article 35 for information.

Article 36 Participation by a third country not eligible under this Regulation Without prejudice to Article 3(5), to ensure the coherence and effectiveness of Community assistance, the Commission may decide when adopting action programmes referred to in Article 22 or the special measures referred to in Article 23 that countries, territories and regions eligible for Community assis- tance under Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 or Regulation (EC) No [\u2026] and the EDF are eligible for measures under this Regu- lation where the geographic or thematic project or programme to be implemented is of a global, regional or cross border nature. Provision may be made for this method of financing in the strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes referred to in Articles 19 and 20. The provisions of Article 10 concerning eligibility and the provisions of Article 31 concerning participation in public procurement and grant award procedures and rules of origin shall be adapted to allow the countries, territories and regions concerned to take part. 12.12.2006 C 301E/73 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

        "STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I. INTRODUCTION On 29 September 2004, the Commission forwarded a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation. The proposal was based on Articles 179(1) and 181a(2) of the EC Treaty. The European Parliament delivered its Opinion at first reading on 18 May 2006. The Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251 of the EC Treaty on 23 October 2006. II. OBJECTIVE In accordance with Article 179 of the EC Treaty, the objective of the proposed Regulation is to finance measures aimed at supporting cooperation with developing countries, territories and regions set out in the Annex to the Regulation and to finance thematic programmes in countries, regions and territories eligible to assistance under a geographical programme of the Regulation, to assistance under the Euro- pean Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument or to geographical cooperation under the European Development Fund. III. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON POSITION General The initial Commission proposal covered the general objectives defined in Title XX and Title XXI of the EC Treaty. It therefore provided support for both development policy and all forms of cooperation with developing countries, countries in transition and industrialised countries. It did not impose any restrictions regarding the areas of Community cooperation or intervention. At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a great many amendments to the initial Commission proposal with a view to reducing its scope to developing countries and basing it on a single Treaty provision (Article 179). The European Parliament also wished to transform the proposed Regulation into a procedural instrument and favoured policy priorities being established by separate co-decided Regulations. Transforming the proposed Regulation into a procedural instrument requiring several new Commission proposals was not acceptable to Council or Commission which both believed that such approach would be incompatible with the stated aim of simplifying the structure of the Community's external financing instruments. After intensive discussions between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, an understanding on the architecture of the proposed Regulation was reached late June 2006 within the framework of an overall agreement on the package of external financing instru- ments. Further to this understanding, a proposal for a Regulation on cooperation with industrialised countries was separated from the initial Commission proposal. The Common Position, reflecting this understanding between all Institutions involved, now provides for a Regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation, based solely on Article 179 of the EC Treaty and is a response to a large number of the concerns voiced in the Euro- pean Parliament's first-reading amendments. The following sections describe the changes of substance. Recitals The number and content of the recitals have been expanded in order to match the changes introduced in the body of the Regulation. 12.12.2006 C 301E/82 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "Legal basis In accordance with the understanding reached between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the overall architecture of the external financing instruments, the initial Commission proposal for an instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation was slimmed down and limited to a financing instrument for development cooperation. This change made it possible to delete the reference to Article 181a(1) of the EC Treaty, and to base the Regulation solely on Article 179(1). Scope, objectives and general principles (Articles 1 to 3) Article 1 of the Common Position provides that the overall purpose of the Regulation is to finance measures aimed at supporting cooperation with certain developing countries, territories and regions and to finance thematic programmes in countries, regions and territories eligible to assistance under a geographical programme of the Regulation, to assistance under the European Neighbourhood and Part- nership Instrument or to geographical cooperation under the European Development Fund. Article 2 lays down the objectives of geographical and thematic cooperation with partner countries and regions. It also provides that measures aimed at cooperation under geographical programmes shall be designed so as to be fully eligible for Official Development Assistance. Thematic programmes shall be equally designed so as to fulfil the criteria for Official Development Assistance, subject to some duly defined and quantified exceptions. Article 3 contains general principles applicable to all measures and programmes under the Regulation. These principles are based on Title XX of the EC Treaty, the Development Policy Statement and various internationally accepted principles and commitments, including on aid effectiveness. Geographical and thematic programmes (Articles 4 to 17) The Council, very much like the European Parliament in its opinion at first reading, was concerned at the lack of policy content in the initial Commission proposal. Article 3 of the initial Commission proposal merely stated that measures should be financed under geographical or thematic programmes, which would be drawn up by the Commission, that would equally specify their geographical scope. The Council, however, chose to take a different way in order to preserve its legislative powers. Rather than reducing the initial Commission proposal to a procedural instrument, requiring the Commission to make use of its right of initiative to present proposals for additional policy regulations, the Council felt that it would be more appropriate to introduce policy content in the provisions of the Regulation. Therefore, Articles 5 to 10 of the Common Position set the policy for geographical programmes, while Articles 11 to 16 provide for the content of thematic programmes. Article 5 is a horizontal provision, laying down principles applicable to each geographical programme. Hence, consistently with the overall purpose and scope, objectives and general principles of the Regu- lation, geographical cooperation with developing countries in Latin America, Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East, and with South Africa, shall include actions within areas such as poverty eradication and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals or areas which are defined in the Development Policy Statement as areas for Community action, including human development; social cohesion and employment; governance, democracy, human rights and support for institutional reforms; trade and regional integration; environment and sustainable development of natural resources; water and energy; infrastructure, communication and transport; rural development, territorial planning, agriculture and food security; as well as post-crisis situations and fragile States. Articles 6 to 10 lay down areas of cooperation with each of the geographical regions, which shall be consistent with and additional to the actions provided for in Article 5. These specific additional areas of cooperation allow for a tailor-made approach taking fully into account the characteristics of each geographical region. The content of these provisions is largely based on existing Regulations. 12.12.2006 C 301E/83 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "A similar approach was followed for thematic programmes. Article 11 sets out the principles applying to all thematic programmes. Specific content is laid down in the following provisions, detailing the content of the various thematic programmes: Investing in people (Article 12), Environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy (Article 13), Non State actors and local authorities in development (Article 14), Food Security (Article 15), and Migration and Asylum (Article 16). To a large extent, the content of these thematic provisions is based on, but not limited to, existing thematic Regulations. The content has been adapted to changing needs and realities, takes into account the Development Policy Statement and reflects a series of communications presented by the Commis- sion in January 2006. Finally, following up on Regulation (EC) No 266/2006, provision was made in Article 17 for Com- munity assistance to ACP Sugar Protocol countries aimed at supporting their adjustment process due to the reform of the common organization of the market in sugar. Financial provisions (Article 38 and Annex IV) The Common Position, in its Article 38, provides for a financial reference amount for implementation of the Regulation for the period 2007-2013. The indicative amounts allocated to each programme are laid down in Annex IV, which forms an integral part of the Regulation. The Common Position also earmarks an indicative amount in the total amount for thematic programmes to finance activities that benefit countries under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. The inclusion of this indicative financial breakdown is the Council's response to a shared concern with the European Parliament, i.e. the need for greater involvement of both Institutions in resource alloca- tion. Review, entry into force and application (Articles 40 and 41) The Common Position provides for the Regulation to enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal. It will apply from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. Moreover, Article 40 puts an obligation upon the Commission to present a report to the European Parliament and the Council evaluating the implementation of the Regulation, including the indicative financial allocations set out in Annex IV, not later than 31 December 2010. IV. CONCLUSION The Council considers that its Common Position, which is the result of extensive preparatory work and negotiations since 2005 and which is supported by the Commission, addresses the concerns expressed by the European Parliament. As a result of frequent and intensive contacts and exchanges of views between the respective Presiden- cies of the Council and key players of the European Parliament, a significant convergence of positions between the two Institutions emerged during the process. This convergence has finally led to compro- mise solutions, reflected in the Common Position, for all outstanding issues. Thus, the Common Position seeks to establish a workable and efficient financing instrument for Com- munity development cooperation, which represents a good balance between the need to simplify the existing instruments and respect for the powers of both branches of the legislature. 12.12.2006 C 301E/84 Official Journal of the European Union EN "
