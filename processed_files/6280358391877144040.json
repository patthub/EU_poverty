        "\u2018Results financing\u2019 EIB operations outside the EU The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the EU bank. We support the EU\u2019s external priorities in some 160 partner countries worldwide, applying EU standards and policies to the projects financed. The Bank, which is owned by the 28 Member States, provides finance and technical assistance for sound projects that stimulate growth and jobs to help put an end to poverty. We apply our knowledge and experience from European operations to the benefit of our partner countries. Improved water, sewerage and waste systems Intermediated lending ",
        "T he mandate for the EIB to provide loans out- side the EU is agreed for a seven-year period between the European Commission, Parliament and Council. With this mandate comes an EU guaran- tee enabling the Bank to lend up to 25-30 times the amount provisioned; a considerable multiplier effect in direct support of the European external action and development effort. All our projects are appraised on their economic and technical soundness and compli- ance with high environmental and social standards and are approved by the 28 Member States and the European Commission. To monitor the results and development outcomes of the projects we support more systematically, in 2012 the EIB launched the Results Measurement frame- work (ReM) . The first report on the expected impact of our operations outside the EU has been issued. The EIB finances projects with the support of the EU guarantee from the external lending mandate in pre-accession countries, in our Southern neighbours (FEMIP region), in our Eastern neighbours and Cen- tral Asia (ENCA region) and in Asia and Latin America. Our operations in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries are carried out under the Cotonou Agree- Promoting sustainable growth beyond the EU\u2019s borders ment with funds and guarantees from EU Member States. Finally, the Bank also has dedicated cross- regional facilities for lending at the EIB\u2019s own risk. Pro- jects outside the EU account for around 10% of the Bank\u2019s total lending activities \u2013 EUR 7.4bn in 2012. Our strategic objectives outside the EU Local private sector development: Develop- ing a dynamic private sector is of critical impor- tance for achieving more inclusive growth. How- ever, success in doing so crucially depends on the ability of entrepreneurs to obtain financing to implement sound business plans. Promoting access to finance for micro and smaller business- es forms an integral part of our efforts to sup- port growth and job creation in neighbouring and partner countries. Development of social and economic infra- structure: No country can grow at its full poten- tial without well-developed infrastructure , be that economic infrastructure such as roads and power plants or social infrastructure such as ac- cess to health, education and housing. The EIB\u2019s \u2018Results financing\u2019 \u2013 EIB operations outside the EU ",
        "long-term finance and expertise is key to sup- porting national infrastructure but also to con- necting regional and intra-regional infrastructure. Climate change mitigation and adaptation: For economic growth to be sustainable, adverse im- pacts on our environment or climate must be limited. 90% of carbon dioxide emissions origi- nate outside the EU, with a globally harmful im- pact. By investing in environmentally sustain- able technologies both within and outside the EU, the EIB helps preserve our common environ- ment to global benefit. Additionality of EIB operations The EIB seeks to make a difference by offering financ- ing conditions that cannot be provided by the mar- ket alone, and by supporting project preparation and implementation. This difference between the EIB contribution and market alternatives is defined as additionality. Lending is by far the EIB\u2019s principal activity, but the Bank\u2019s role goes beyond lending to include blend- ing , for example combining EIB loans with EU grants, and advising . EIB loans extend the typical tenor available to projects and reduce the gap between as- set life and loan maturity. The Bank can help clients mitigate foreign exchange risk by financing in local currency. The three main areas in which the EIB contribution stands apart from the market alternatives are: Long-term resources adapted to project needs: Five indicators are used: extension of typical ma- turity, match with asset life, local currency fund- ing, grant element and innovative products. Technical contribution: The EIB not only pro- vides financing but also often contributes to im- proving the project characteristics in business, developmental, social, environmental or corpo- rate governance terms. Standards and resource mobilisation: The EIB\u2019s presence in the transaction adds value by pro- viding demonstration effects, raising standards, or mobilising other financial resources. Supporting small businesses in Uganda A EUR 40m credit line to the \u2018Private Enterprise Fi- nance Facility II\u2019 (PEFF) helped six local banks in Uganda to on-lend to small and medium-sized enterprises. Ugandan banks were able to supply long-term financing, with tenors up to 10 years, which would otherwise not have been possible. As the EIB assumes the foreign exchange risk, the loans can be denominated in Ugandan shillings and still carry affordable interest rates. Fabian Kasi, Managing Director of Centenary Rural Development Bank PEFF, confirmed the im- portance of the credit line in creating employ- ment in Uganda: \u201cSMEs sit at the heart of the eco- nomic development of this country.\u201d The credit lines supported businesses such as a guest house near Lake Victoria employing 20 people dur- ing construction and creating 15 new jobs once opened.

        "2012 results of EIB operations outside the EU T he Results Measurement (ReM) framework further improves the ex-ante assessment of expected project results and enhances the Bank\u2019s ability to monitor and report on actu- al results achieved . It provides an assessment of results throughout the project cycle; indicators with baselines and targets are defined at appraisal and monitored at project completion and again three years after project completion. Projects are rated according to three pillars: Pillar 1 Expected contribution to lending objectives Pillar 2 Quality and soundness of the operation, based on expected results Pillar 3 Expected financial and non-financial additionality In 2012, the EIB approved 90 operations totalling EUR 8.1bn outside the EU. Together, infrastruc- ture (mainly energy and transport) and support for smaller businesses (micro, small and medium-sized enterprises) accounted for 81% of this lending. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Amount (EUR m) Number of projects Approvals by region (amounts and number) \u25a0 EAST \u25a0 ALA \u25a0 ACP \u25a0 MED \u25a0 Pre-Accession 27 15 14 3 022 25 1 767 12 1 128 1 114 1 077 \u2018Results financing\u2019 \u2013 EIB operations outside the EU ",

By applying environmental and social stand- ards, the Bank promotes the creation of \u201cdecent\u201d jobs, which respect the International Labour Organ- isation\u2019s core labour standards and are associated with better living standards. Of the 90 operations approved in 2012, 27 are expected to create 9 000 new permanent jobs and 45 are expected to create some 300 000 new temporary jobs during construction. Moreover, the 34 intermediated operations are expected to contribute to sustaining roughly 3.3 million existing jobs in micro, small and medi- um-sized enterprises. Working for better results for EU and partner countries The EIB will use the ReM framework to further im- prove the relevance and quality of its portfolio, whilst maintaining our objective of contributing to European external and development policy and serving the needs of the partner countries in which the Bank operates. 2012 operations approved received largely good or excellent ratings and, more important- ly, are expected to yield significant concrete results that will contribute to the improvement of people\u2019s living standards. \u2018Results financing\u2019 \u2013 EIB operations outside the EU ",

The upgrading of the urban road net- work has led to improved traffic conditions and has reduced numbers of accidents and road fatali- ties. Moreover, the link to Tunis\u2019 main port makes international trade more efficient and the urban bypasses have improved links with neighbouring Algeria and Libya. According to the Head of the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges, without the EIB contribu- tion many road construction projects would have been postponed for years. Above and beyond the Bank\u2019s financial additionality, EIB participation ensured enhanced environmental and social stand- ards by incorporating a public consultation process in the project preparation. I n f r a - s t r u c t u r e Bringing large-scale wind power to Cape Verde A EUR 30m loan for a wind farm enabled the small island state to move towards a reliable source of non-polluting energy. Cape Verde had been dependent on expensive, import- ed, fuel-based energy sources, and suffered increasingly from electricity shortages. Today, approximately 70% of the popu- lation benefit from the cheaper, sustainable and renewable electricity supplied by wind turbines, increasing the country\u2019s use of renewable sources of energy from 2-25%. Annually, the cost of electricity generation has been cut by 16% \u2013 EUR 1.6m per year - and reductions in fuel oil imports result in savings of EUR 10m in foreign exchange expenditures. Moreover, green- house gas (GHG) emissions will be reduced by 67 400 tonnes per year when the wind farm is generating at full capacity. Through its participation, the EIB was also able to attract pri- vate sector support from other IFIs, which resulted in the first successful public-private partnership in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fabio Borba, Vice-President of InfraCo, which is managing the wind farm, said \u201cIts novel public-private partnership structure will set an example for the whole region.\u201d R e n e w a b l e E n e r g y "
