Voluntary activity promotes personal development by offering an opportunity for informal and non-formal learning. The development of social awareness and of key competences and skills makes volunteers more employable and enhances their active participation in society. In its efforts to promote the recognition of informal and non-formal learning the EU should put particular emphasis on the recognition of competences acquired through voluntary activities. Voluntary activity can also give various marginalised population groups an opportunity for involvement and integration, either because volunteers are working for their benefit or because they are brought back to the centre of society through their own commitment. This kind of empowerment through voluntary activity is particularly important for migrants, who in some Member States are unfortunately prohibited by law from becoming volunteers.

Qualities that will be crucial to professional as well as social life are acquired in the family, such as respect for others, making an effort, team spirit, tolerance, social behaviour, and responsible independence. Families are a source of economic prosperity, especially when both parents can be gainfully employed, but they are also a source of social solidarity. The EU should therefore encourage all Member States to incorporate the family dimension in its economic and social policies. The EU should use best practice to promote a sustainable family policy.

The European Union should devote more financial resources to exchange programmes in order to double the current rate of participation in youth exchanges and also significantly increase the participation rate of other age groups. The Committee underlines the need for a more active participation in society of all people, but especially of the young and/or disadvantaged, in order to strengthen their sense of citizenship and solidarity. European cooperation in the field of civic services should be enhanced. [1.4] In its exploratory opinion on Social exclusion Social exclusion Social exclusion Social exclusion (SOC/339, rapporteur: Brenda KING, Employers' Group \u2013 United Kingdom) the Committee calls for the role of intercultural dialogue to be emphasised in order to build confidence in a common future and in civic values such as fairness, tolerance, respect for freedom and democracy, gender equality, solidarity and social responsibility, and engendering a sense of belonging and mutual recognition.

Over-concentration of these pupils in poor quality \"ghetto-schools\" \u2013 as frequently occurs \u2013 must be prevented. School education, at all stages, lays down the foundations for the integration of new generations. Those working in social services, education, police forces, health services and all other public services should receive training courses that enable them to deal appropriately with immigrant and minority populations.

Teachers' education and professional training are closely related to other key policies, including youth policy. Non-formal learning can complement formal education and provide those necessary skills that can be better developed in a less formal system, while formal education can incorporate non-formal methods by applying lifelong learning principles.

The Committee calls for the reintegration of education and training into real life, bringing it closer to both the public needs and the habits of the new generations of learners. All forms of workplace learning should be encouraged. Enhancing individual motivation to learn as well as companies\u2019 commitment to motivating workers to learn should be priorities.

        "WORKSHOP WORKSHOP WORKSHOP WORKSHOP 2 2 2 2 12 12 12 12 Committee refers to the link between poverty risk and poor education. In-work poverty can result from low education levels and lack of qualifications for adequately remunerated jobs. The most vulnerable groups are older workers, the young, women, large families, those with a disability, early school leavers and migrants. It is vital to provide all people with a disability with appropriate workplace conditions and to give every child a good start in life through early years education, but also by tackling the school dropout rate, which, at the current level of 15% in Europe, is still too high. New ways of combining social protection and jobs (housing, healthcare and education for both workers and their children, etc.) should be introduced in order to secure decent incomes for all. [2.4] In its exploratory opinion on Social exclusion Social exclusion Social exclusion Social exclusion (SOC/339, rapporteur: Brenda KING, Employers' Group \u2013 United Kingdom) the Committee states that people who are able to work should be encouraged to actively search for employment and that they should get the necessary support. For those who cannot work, adequate income support must be provided. If the chances of the disadvantaged to succeed in the labour market are to be improved, better cooperation is needed between public authorities, public and private employment services, social services, adult education services, social partners and civil society. Social dialogue should be complemented by civic dialogue: civil society organisations, with their experience, knowledge and often strong connections to vulnerable groups, should be included as important resources in shaping policies to increase social inclusion.

The Commission should be the driving force behind the implementation and development of such a network and the Committee would be more than happy to participate in this project, given its role as a \"bridge to organised civil society\" .

Discussions have been ongoing for many years on the recognition of non-formal education, which takes place outside traditional educational settings, complements formal education by providing people with practical competences, \"soft\" skills and attitudes and encourages active citizenship. Although these discussions have not yet culminated in consensual agreements at EU level, non-formal education is gradually being recognised as being of help in accessing the labour market.

This means eradicating all existing obstacles in education and training systems, whether administrative or in the workplace. Those most adversely affected by these obstacles are vulnerable groups such as older workers and people with disabilities.

It is important to ensure that it ties in closely with preceding and subsequent educational levels, particularly with general education and higher education. The different age groups \u2013 including young children \u2013 should be provided with the necessary development opportunities and infrastructures. Particular attention should be paid to those at risk of educational and labour market exclusion (e.g. early school leavers, young people and older workers facing high unemployment rates, people with special needs, and people with an immigrant background) and their (re-)integration into training. The Commission should cooperate more closely with organised civil society on quality assurance in VET, in order to make the system, which should be based on existing networks and positive experience, more inclusive.

Early school leavers in particular encounter great difficulties in finding a job, resulting in low incomes and in the risk of suffering poverty and social exclusion later in life. In recent years social inequality has increasingly and markedly led to unequal success in studies and in gaining qualifications and access to skilled jobs. Young employees find themselves in insecure situations, earning low wages and experiencing poor working conditions and standards of living. Qualifications are no longer an insurance against unemployment or deskilling. The EU Strategy for Youth should build on specific measures in the following areas: i) providing better and more accessible education and vocational training; ii) implementing measures to ensure that short-term and insecure employment do not become the norm for young people; iii) developing easily accessible careers advice and information facilities at all levels of training, and creating more opportunities for quality internships and apprenticeships; iv) ensuring early active support for young people seeking training course places or jobs, and special programmes for the integration of the long-term unemployed, young people and school and training course drop-outs; v) improving cooperation between educational institutions and employers; vi) creating links between educational systems and business, where this is useful; and vii) creating links with associations and recognising voluntary activities.

The social partners have a specific responsibility in this context and should involve themselves by: i) alerting education authorities, schools and teachers to the need for closer links with the world of work; ii) establishing partnerships with schools, in order to give young people work experience within companies; iii) informing ",

The obstacles to a gender balance in jobs and functions have their roots in the education system, where boys and girls choose different careers. Parents and teachers need to be made more aware of the consequences of the career choices young people make. Management and union representatives who negotiate wage structures also have a key role and need to understand the value of the skills learned in the domestic and family sphere. Gender balance is also lacking in leadership positions. Steps must be taken to foster a better gender balance in large businesses and in senior civil service levels. ",

[2.14] In its own-initiative opinion on Integration and the Social Integration and the Social Integration and the Social Integration and the Social Agenda Agenda Agenda Agenda (SOC/362, rapporteur: Luis Miguel PARIZA CASTA\u00d1OS, Employees' Group \u2013 Spain; co-rapporteur: Pedro ALMEIDA FREIRE, Employers' Group \u2013 Portugal) the Committee expresses the view that integration and social inclusion policies should focus on a range of areas: initial arrival, language teaching, laws and customs, combating discrimination, employment and training policies, gender equality, education for minors, family policy, youth policy, housing, healthcare, addressing poverty, extending social services, and making it easier for people from immigrant backgrounds to become active citizens. Member States' integration policies include education and training as key elements in the process. Young immigrants and minorities face specific obstacles and challenges which require particular attention. Access to the labour market is crucial and an essential part of the integration process, because decent jobs are vital to immigrants' self- sufficiency. They also facilitate social relations and mutual understanding between the host society and immigrants. Immigrant workers, and women in particular, often have precarious and poor- quality jobs, with lower pay. In general, immigrant workers are more willing to relocate, but national legislation prevents or restricts such mobility. [2.15] According to the Committee opinion on Migration, mobility Migration, mobility Migration, mobility Migration, mobility and education and education and education and education (SOC/327, rapporteur: M\u00e1rio SOARES, Employees' Group \u2013 Portugal) Member States must commit themselves to ensuring that immigrants are integrated into society. Where children and young people are concerned, this means not only providing everyone with access to the education system but also working to ensure that educational success is considered to be a right. To this end, the educational response must be based on: i) a high-quality education system open to everyone and free of charge; ii) a policy which respects ethnic, socio-cultural, economic and gender ",
        "WORKSHOP WORKSHOP WORKSHOP WORKSHOP 2 2 2 2 17 17 17 17 differences, amongst other things, and which is able to capitalise on existing potential; iii) respect for the specific features of each migrant community, which should be taken into account when planning curricula, with a view to broadening schools\u2019 intercultural horizons; iv) a body of teaching staff able to meet the needs of pupils from other countries, who are given the support and continuous training required to meet their educational goals and who have support from auxiliary staff fluent in the languages and cultures of the communities represented in their schools; v) access to the Internet as a teaching support for migrant children, because this is a crucial tool for academic success in the EU; vi) a \"sustainable\" education system: language promotion should not be confined to the earliest years of a child\u2019s life \u2013 preserving and promoting multilingualism should form part of every school\u2019s core curriculum; vii) involvement of the migrant pupils' parents, as parents should become more familiar with the education system and the opportunities for professional training; viii) a complete range of adult education courses for people from a migrant background; and ix) promotion of \"intercultural\" skills, which would include awarding study grants and financial support to reduce educational disadvantages. [2.16] In its exploratory opinion on Integration of minorities Integration of minorities Integration of minorities Integration of minorities \u2013 \u2013\u2013 \u2013 Roma Roma Roma Roma (SOC/263, rapporteur: Anne-Marie SIGMUND, Various Interests Group \u2013 Austria; co-rapporteur: Madi SHARMA, Employers' Group \u2013 United Kingdom) the Committee stresses that Member States need to ensure their education systems do not discriminate against Roma, and additionally allow for adult programmes fostering literacy, numeracy and life long learning. It is inordinately difficult for Roma to reach higher levels of education and get good vocational training. Tools to strengthen school attendance are essential to break the cycle of generations of uneducated Roma. Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), introduced in some countries, is an option to encourage school attendance and should involve the requirement to prove that children are registered and have their birth certificate. Segregation in education arises in the first instance from the geographical separation of Roma settlement areas from the majority population. In addition, non-Roma will often remove their children from schools if the percentage of Roma children in a class gets too high, which in turn leads to the creation of segregated schools or classes for Roma children. These schools often do not meet the ",
        "WORKSHOP WORKSHOP WORKSHOP WORKSHOP 2 2 2 2 18 18 18 18 required standards, which in turn results in perfectly capable Roma children being channelled into special schools and usually excluded from the possibility of continuing their education. The practice of unwarranted placement in special schools is a blatant contravention of fundamental rights and must be opposed with all legal and administrative means. An important reason for failure to attend school is poverty, since parents either cannot (or will not) pay the costs involved or they set their children to work either helping to support the family or looking after younger siblings. Girls are especially affected by this. Economic integration requires members of minorities to surmount a series of hurdles that often reinforce one another. Having no or very low educational or training qualifications or inadequate or unrecognised ones automatically discriminates against the individual. Ways can be found to bring Roma out of the shadow economy and to enable them to participate in regular economic activity, for example by means of microcredits and business start-up and support mechanisms. Additional resources could be provided to make legitimate work more attractive, following the principle of \"positive benefits for positive efforts\". Welfare-to-work programmes could be introduced in partnership with both public and private sector organisations. Discrimination in the workplace, and during the application process, is well documented and legislative measures must be enforced against this practice. However, access to relevant vocational training so that Roma can move from unskilled or semi skilled work needs to be identified to create a total culture change. [2.17] In its opinion on Integration of immigrant workers Integration of immigrant workers Integration of immigrant workers Integration of immigrant workers (SOC/364, rapporteur: Luis Miguel PARIZA CASTA\u00d1OS, Employees' Group \u2013 Spain) the Committee expresses the view that immigration legislation should facilitate integration and view immigrant workers as new citizens, as human beings with rights that must be safeguarded and not purely as a pool of labour from which to meet the needs of the labour markets. The social partners must participate at all the different levels. The Commission's proposal to set up a European platform for dialogue on managing labour migration, in which the social partners can be involved, is welcomed. The cultural diversity arising from immigration poses a new challenge that must be faced if business culture is to be broadened in order to integrate new workers at all levels.

For European society to survive and compete in the new global economy, citizens need to become more entrepreneurial. To achieve this objective, the modernisation of European education systems has to be addressed and the roles of universities and businesses have to be recognised as key drivers in that process.

Education for all promotes equality and social inclusion and has been recognised as a basic human right since the EU was founded. On the basis of the concept of education for inclusion, the Committee recommends that the EU and the Member States undertake to revise education policies, including the allocation of resources. It is essential that all those excluded benefit from education, which gives them access to the labour market and to decent, well-paid work. It is no less important that this education passes on fundamental values of citizenship, of effective equality between the sexes and of active democratic involvement. The Committee is committed to education that is not just utilitarian, focusing solely on passing on skills, but contributes to personal and social development, producing open and critical individuals who are able to become actively involved in more politically mature and increasingly socially equitable societies.

However, it notes with satisfaction that the action plan devotes a great deal of attention to improving European cooperation in the field of vocational training. The advancement of people whom the Commission terms \"low-skilled\" requires not only that they themselves change, but also that steps be taken to break down the continuing barriers to learning.
