        "1 CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE INTRODUCTION The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) kick-off event \u2018Bringing the European project back to citizens\u2019 was held in the context of the launch of the Conference on the Future of Europe, which was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Conference is a year-long public consultation that was first proposed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. It is jointly organised by the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission. It aims to gather the views of European citizens on the priorities and changes they want from the European Union in key areas. The input will inform recommendations from the Conference for follow up by the three EU institutions. The EESC has a pivotal role in this process. Since 1958, it has been the voice of civil society, with an extensive network of members. It provides employers, workers and organisations representing the diversity of European society with a say in EU decision making. This launch event on 10 June marked the beginning of EESC action to ensure that its members and those they represent can participate fully in the first direct Europe-wide consultation of citizens on EU-policy-making. Participants and speakers attended the four-hour event in both the main meeting room of the EESC in Brussels and online. In total, almost 2 000 people from as far apart as Dublin and Budapest logged in to hear 16 speakers representing the EESC, the European Commission, the European Parliament, industry, national government, the trade-union movement, European movements and experts in fundamental rights. Representatives discussed their hopes for the Conference and the future of Europe in four panels that touched on shared fundamental values as well as possible frameworks for a sustainable economic and social recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and for resilient societies. As EESC President Christa Schweng said in her welcome address: \u2018We have reasons today to be optimistic, for the recovery and for much more.\u2019 She called on decision-makers to listen to organised civil society and to citizens when shaping the EU\u2019s future: \u2018The EU belongs to them,\u2019 she said. ",
        "2 OPENING Speakers from the EESC, the European Commission and the European Parliament opened the event after an introduction from moderator Brian Maguire. Ms Schweng welcomed participants on behalf of the EESC. She applauded the solidarity, strength and budget response of the EU in the recent health and economic crisis. She said that civil society could help to create a Europe that is better prepared for the next challenges, both expected and unknown. She called for a European narrative \u2018which does not only look at the past [...] but also and foremost to the future\u2019. Indeed, the EESC\u2019s recent resolution on this aspect promotes a vision of Europe as a guardian and promoter of shared fundamental values, open trade and multilateralism, and sustainable prosperity, with a social model based on fair competition and solidarity. \u2018We want our citizens to feel that too,\u2019 she added. With this in mind, Ms Schweng urged openness and accountability in processing ideas from the Conference, suggesting the creation of an online dashboard that allows citizens to track progress. She said that the EESC will be critical in providing recommendations and helping to reconnect European institutions and policies with citizens. \u2018We are now ready to work, and starting from today we will provide our contribution,\u2019 she concluded. Dubravka \u0160uica , Vice-President of the European Commission and member of the CoFoE executive board continued the introduction. \u2018For the first time ever, the Conference brings citizens into the heart of policymaking in the European Union,\u2019 she said. \u2018Civil society is a key partner in ensuring that every voice is heard.\u2019 ",
        "3 CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE Ms \u0160uica preferred not to put forward her own proposals. \u2018We cannot pre- empt or influence the outcome of these deliberations.\u2019 She added that she is committed to following up on input from a process that she believes reinforces the EU\u2019s evolving democracy. \u2018We [...] should not lack confidence in the ability of citizens, together with civil society, to contribute concretely and provide us with a substantive response.\u2019 She underscored the values shared between the EESC and the EU institutions \u2013 intergenerational solidarity, gender equality and just, green and digital transitions \u2013 and their joint ambition to strengthen links between citizens and the institutions that serve them. \u2018The EESC is a vital partner in and key to making this process a success. I am looking forward to our cooperation,\u2019 she added. The final opening speaker was Eva Maydell , an MEP and President of the European Movement International. \u2018Now it is time to get into the concrete details and, most importantly, move forward,\u2019 she said. She called for a \u2018bolder vision\u2019 of Europe. \u2018It has to be a plan to deepen European integration in certain sectors, which could make us better prepared, more resilient, safer, more secure and more prosperous.\u2019 One concern was whether \u2018we can do more to increase the engagement among citizens and organisations.\u2019 She suggested that national broadcasters and media could help to increase citizens\u2019 low awareness of the consultation. The cooperation between the European Movement International and the EESC is welcome. \u2018We are uniquely positioned to reach those citizens,\u2019 she said. \u2018By working together [...] we can ensure that civil society and citizens across Europe are truly actively and meaningfully [...] engaged in the Conference.\u2019 ",
        "4 PANEL 1 Shared fundamental values for Europe and beyond The discussion in the first expert panel opened with Slido poll for all participants, which asked \u2018What fundamental values unite European citizens?\u2019 The most prominent answers in the resulting word cloud were \u2018Equality\u2019, \u2018Democracy\u2019, \u2018Solidarity\u2019 and \u2018Freedom\u2019. These were reflected to the keynote speech by Dr Manfred Nowak , Professor for International Human Rights and Scientific Director of the Vienna Master of Arts in Human Rights. The European Union is \u2018founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights\u2019 and is \u2018a value-driven supranational organisation aimed at promoting fundamental rights within its Member States as well as human rights and democracy worldwide,\u2019 he said. These values are shared by EU citizens, he noted. However, as Europe faces challenges such as terrorism, climate crises and rapid digitalisation, citizens need to feel that the EU is \u2018actively living and promoting these fundamental values\u2018. He predicted that \u2018lasting peace can only be achieved and maintained if there is a feeling of social justice and coherence among European citizens and a basic trust that the EU is able and willing to solve the enormous global threats and challenges in an open, transparent and non- bureaucratic manner\u2019. Morten Kj\u00e6rum , Director of the Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law took up this theme. The European Union\u2019s legal framework \u2018creates the basis for a deep respect for freedom of expression and freedom of the media\u2019. He added that Europe has built institutions within a human rights framework, learning lessons from the past: \u2018This feature of Europe needs to be better understood and protected.\u2019 ",
        "5 CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE Mr Kj\u00e6rum sounded the alarm on challenges to the rule of law, growing inequality and the climate crisis. \u2018Integrating these topics [...] in the narrative has the potential to re-engage Europeans in the common project,\u2019 he said, and especially young people. He added that cities had \u2018the power and possibility\u2019 to foster a shared vision of Europe by linking local communities, government institutions and cross-city networks and praised the work in this field of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights. Helena de Felipe Lehtonen , Vice-President of the EESC ad hoc group on Fundamental Rights and the Rule of Law (FRRL) concluded this panel. She explained: \u2018We want to promote a culture of fundamental rights at the European level, in particular with regard to European values.\u2019 She called on civil society to combine forces against the regression in fundamental rights in some Member States. She said that there is a need to provide more information and education, to step up judicial independence and freedom of the press and to strengthen the social-economic dimension, which could capture the interest of citizens. She added that connections with civil society organisations can strengthen a culture of fundamental rights: \u2018We have to continue working at the EU level with national counterparts and civil society to make sure that the links remain strong.\u2019 Questions from the audience followed. These focused on the erosion of the separation of powers, whether funding should be leveraged to protect freedoms, and challenges to democracy and rights outside the EU. Mr Kjaerum said that the EU needs to go further in addressing attacks on rule of law if people are not to lose trust in the EU. Dr Nowak pointed out that linking funding to rule of law could overcome the likely lack of a unanimous vote to invoke more formal penalties under the Treaty on European Union. Finally, Mr Kjaerum argued for consistent action on human rights and more serious engagement with bodies such as the African Union. ",
        "6 PANEL 2 Sustainable economic recovery, skills and innovation A multiple-choice Slido poll on the key elements required for a healthy economy prompted the second panel\u2019s discussions. \u2018Investing in skills fit for the future\u2019 attracted 55% of votes, and was to be a theme from all speakers. Stefano Mallia , President of the Employers\u2019 Group, opened this panel. Mr Mallia shared his vision for the EU: \u2018For me and for the Employers\u2019 Group, this would be a prospering Europe that successfully recovers from the COVID-19 crisis and leads the world in the green and digital transitions.\u2019 He added that this future would offer companies of all sizes the chance to become more productive competitive, generate growth and jobs and make it possible to offer each European a good quality of life. He focused on the need for public bodies and businesses to invest in skills, notably digital skills, STEM subjects, cross-cutting skills and life-long learning, to strengthen links between businesses and education providers, to make full use of EU funds and to complete the single market, \u2018one of our greatest assets\u2019. The Conference is a \u2018unique occasion to engage in a constructive discussion\u2019, Mr Mallia said. Ivonne Bollow , Global Director of Corporate Public Policy at international wholesaler Metro AG continued the debate. She pointed out that as SMEs represent 99% of all businesses and a third of the working population in the EU, \u2018bringing Europe to citizens means bringing it to SMEs\u2019. \u2019Investing in digitalisation and innovation is a very important ingredient,\u2019 she said. She also called for sustainability policies to work across the economy, with support for SMEs to adapt their practices more quickly. ",
        "7 CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE In terms of skills, \u2018the rapid pace of technology embraces all sectors and sub- sectors. So lifelong learning becomes key [...] to ensure that the workforce is kept up to date\u2019, Ms Bellow said. She suggested a European Erasmus-style programme as one solution. She added that a completed single market is a prerequisite for a healthy economy: \u2018We need to define a joint understanding of how the internal market can serve all actors along the supply line, locally and beyond.\u2019 The conference paused for a musical interlude by Brussels Muzieque, a classical chamber music platform of musicians, mainly from Belgian national orchestras. Mr Oettinger , President of United Europe and former EU Commissioner then gave his keynote speech. He said that Europe has fallen behind economically, technologically and has to become competitive. He repeated the call for digital skills to be developed \u2018among all workers, from the boss to the intern\u2019. He added, \u2018We also have to build on our internal market \u2013 start-ups, takeovers \u2013 and we also need to support family businesses [...] That is a cultural good and deserves support.\u2019 He suggested that an innovation strategy for Europe, not just the EU, would make sense. He stressed the need to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy, and called for Europe to better attract skilled non-Europeans and investors. Policy should focus on the economic future, he emphasised. This could include programmes to encourage continued work and reskilling later in life, ensuring that climate action avoids unintended consequences and encouraging entrepreneurship. \u2018We have to teach our children [...] that they have an interest in autonomy, independence and self-reliance, then they will be able to take over and take our economy forward,\u2019 he said. Mr Oettinger also called on the European Commission and Council to develop European industrial policy more quickly and to consult more widely with stakeholders in the economy: \u2018It is the economy that creates new jobs, businesspeople, entrepreneurs. Therefore, there has to be a dialogue at European and national level.\u2019 After a summary from each speaker, the moderator highlighted a comment in the chat that mentioned the difficulty of competing with companies that pay taxes offshore and that do not respect labour and environment laws. ",
        "8 PANEL 3 Sustainable social recovery, job creation and just transition The next panel began after a Slido poll asking participants to pick European Union priorities for the social recovery. Respondents favoured ensuring a fair and just green and digital transition, followed by implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights. Oliver R\u00f6pke , President of the Workers\u2019 Group hailed the Conference for the Future of Europe as \u2018a very good example of involving all stakeholders, including the European Economic and Social Committee, in their priorities, in their policies\u2019. He noted that the social partners and trade unions are among the most important stakeholders, representing millions of workers in Europe and advocated finding new frameworks that strengthen workers\u2019 rights and voices while raising fundamental social rights to the same level as market freedoms. Mr R\u00f6pke added: \u2018We have the responsibility to show to European citizens, workers and businesses that a fairer and more inclusive Europe is possible.\u2019 He and the Workers\u2019 Group believe that \u2018we have to promote public sustainable investment in a green and digital economy but also in a social recovery which is to go hand in hand with an economic recovery.\u2019 Ana Mendes Godinho , Minister for Employment, Solidarity, and Social Security of Portugal, noted in her keynote speech that: \u2018It is the first time the three EU institutions [...] have come together with national parliaments, regional and local authorities, social partners, civil society on a truly common project.\u2019 \u2018The EU is a community of values and a space with a unique social model in the world,\u2019 she said. \u2018Protection and equality of opportunity for everyone is what drives us.\u2019 ",
        "9 CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE However, \u2018we can do better\u2019, she said. The Portuguese presidency aims to make the Conference an inclusive platform, bringing together different voices engaging on a wide reflection going beyond Brussels and national capitals and reaching out to European citizens, Ms Mendes Godinho added. Concretely, she called for a focus on structural investment, more resilient economies and labour markets, social dialogue, innovation and modernisation of companies and training, including attention to precarious employment. She discussed the success of the Porto Social Summit and its important commitment to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights as proof of the power of cooperation within civil society. \u2018Social dialogue is crucial to guarantee social peace. Let\u2019s do it together,\u2019 she concluded. Luca Visentini , Secretary General of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) was the last speaker. \u2018We need to listen to citizens, to organised civil society, to stakeholders, to all the people that want to say something about what Europe they want for the future...,\u2019 he said. \u2018And we need to make sure they can really participate \u2013 that there can be channels for concrete, democratic participation.\u2019 He added: \u2018We need to reimagine our economic model, making sure it is really sustainable and inclusive.\u2019 He called for quality jobs, strong social protection and inclusion. \u2018We need to rebuild our European social model, a social model that was a benchmark and an example to the world,\u2019 he said. He added that there was a need to boost equality and social justice, defend the rule of law and give elected institutions such as the European Parliament more power and visibility. \u2018If we are united and cooperate with each other and boost social, economic and institutional dialogue, I am convinced we can make it,\u2019 he ended. ",
        "10 PANEL 4 Sustainable, inclusive and participative societies The final panel opened with a keynote speech from Dr Se\u00e1n Healy , CEO of Social Justice Ireland. He thanked the organisers for driving forward the Conference. \u2018Europe needs it badly,\u2019 he said. Among other topics, he mentioned that \u2018we still have 18 million people at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the Union\u2019. He called for \u2018a new social contract\u2019 with \u2018strong, ambitious targets\u2019. He mentioned that many people in Europe also feel that their voices are not heard in shaping polices, adding \u2018two-tier societies are bad for business as well as bad for citizens\u2019. Dr Healy noted the need for social dialogue about all the major issues that will shape our future. \u2018That social dialogue should include civil society on an equal footing with employers and trade unions,\u2019 he said. He advocated a social contract that focuses on delivering a vibrant economy, decent services and infrastructure, just taxation, good governance and sustainability in parallel. \u2018Unless they are done simultaneously, then we are condemned to fail again in delivering a Europe that has a place for everybody,\u2019 he said. The next speaker, S\u00e9amus Boland , President of the Diversity Europe Group called for more focus on sustainablity issues. \u2018Sustainability is at heart of our group, Diversity Europe,\u2019 he said. \u2018If we fail to include civil society in the social dialogue discussions then we have effectively excluded millions of people and millions of groups from participating in the Conference on the Future of Europe.\u2019 ",
        "11 CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE In the context of the Conference, policymakers need to imagine and to build equal, resilient and sustainable communities and societies. \u2018This requires bottom-up initiatives. It requires the embracing of new definitions of wellbeing and development beyond GDP,\u2019 he stated. Addressing the online audience, Mr Boland said: \u2018You are here because you really want to make sure that you have a say and a voice in a society that does not repeat past mistakes... Let us hope that these deliberations and many more will bring a very different, just, inclusive society into being.\u2019 Brikena Xhomaqi , Co-president of the Liaison Group and Director of the Lifelong Learning Platform (LLLP), said: \u2018The world is changing, and so is politics.\u2019 \u2018We must shift into a bottom-up process where we co-create and co-design policies with the citizens.\u2019 Ms Xhomaqi added: \u2018We just need to create more spaces for cooperation, more spaces for exchanges of good practices, more spaces to learn from each other.\u2019 Civil society had helped her to address her earlier lack of awareness about Europe, she said. \u2018I had the chance to get engaged in European networks and that brought me all that knowledge about Europe and understanding of how it functions in order to be able to influence it.\u2019 Despite the need for European institutions to consult more with civil society, \u2018we also have a role in building consensus at all levels across countries and have a strong voice in the European policy and legal discussions\u2019, she said. ",
        "12 CLOSING REMARKS Cillian Lohan , Vice-President of the EESC, thanked all participants: \u2018We can easily agree on some of the broader objectives... What is really valuable with the Conference on the Future of Europe is designing along with citizens how we are going to get there.\u2019 He added: \u2018We are in the final steps of launching a series of debates all over Europe with our members, with our civil society partners so that we can reach every corner of the EU to get ideas, thoughts and ambitions.\u2019 Ms Schweng concluded the proceedings. \u2018Today was our starting point to harvest the views of EU citizens and organised civil society with a view to work on a stronger and a more resilient Europe,\u2019 she noted. \u2018Today\u2019s discussions and the ideas expressed throughout the afternoon are highly appreciated.\u2019 She added: \u2018However, we need to go beyond Brussels. We need to reach out to each and every corner of the EU and gather citizens\u2019 ideas and proposals for the European future. The second step needs to be bringing the EU project back to citizens and to shape Europe according to their needs, ideas and ambitions.\u2019 Ms Schweng said the EESC is ready to make the effort to ensure this input occurs: \u2018I am confident we will seize the opportunity to bring the EU project back to citizens... Let\u2019s make Europe a truly great place to be and prosper.\u2019 ",
