        "FOREWORD The \"Life Sciences and Technolog)\u00b7 for Developing Countries (STD3)\" Research Programme of the Third Framework Programme for Research. Technology and Development of the European Union, has supported a consultation on research in the sustainable use and management of natural resources in Developing Countries (DCs), focusing the attention of researchers on the creation of a common framework for their own research activities. Several discussions and opportunities for debate were created by STD3 on subjects where research could and should play a relevant role in understanding the mechanisms for sustainable development. One of these activities, conducted in Rennes (March 1992), identified a fresh approach that constitutes a new challenge to soil scientists to define their own action in line with \"sustainable development\". This is the Holistic Approach to soil research. The intention of the Harare meeting was to use this new conceptual approach in a specific geographic situation and to verify its applicability as a international action related to benchmark soil sites. This meeting was organized as a \"brain-storming\" workshop, involving a group of soil scientists from the Europe and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. It was held in Harare in November. 1993. The participants carried out their discussions bearing in mind a number of important concepts including : - the long term sustainable use of the soil. - identification of the problems as they are perceived by the SADC participants. - consideration of these problems in the local/regional situation, the research programmes needed to solve them. - identification of the institutional requirements needed to support research. - the identification of areas and actions of potential co-operation between individual SADC countries and between the European Union and the SADC countries. The SADC region (see appendix 2) was chosen for its complexity and the existence of coordinating bodies such as the Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research (SACCAR). In fact. SACCAR supported the initiative, not only by assuring the participation of many researchers in the debate, but also by co-chairing the meeting. Underlying these concepts is a strong and genuine desire to cooperate with local people on the problem of alleviating the human-induced degradation of the environment of many communities in southern Africa. In the past, sincere and well-meaning attempts to assist development have often failed because the local social and economic context within which problems have to be solved was not fully taken into account by researchers or visiting experts and not sufficiently well underlined by the local authorities. A more effective \"transfer of knowledge\" must be evolved and indigenous technology knowledge should be scientifically analyzed and supported whenever relevant; the main beneficiaries of these analyses, i.e. technical and decision-making staff in DCs. have not acted ",
        "as receptors of the messages produced and thus no practical consequences have ensued. DCs and foreign researchers were unable to produce useful or satisfactory answers to many of the problems of life in their countries. Governments and politicians in DCs. all too often, have been more interested in pleasing donors and ensuring a continuing flow of aid funds rather than analyzing critically their own approaches and requirements for development. On the donor's side tying aid has been a common preoccupation, leading to the recycling of a significant share of funds intended for investments in DCs. All these attitudes have not contributed towards high levels of cost-effectiveness in development projects. It is time to change this state of affairs if we are ever to achieve the objective of sustainable development. Mario Catizzone Sam Muchena STD3 Programme SACCAR ",
        "INTRODUCTION As discussed in Rennes (March 1992), soil is a complex organo-mineral body capable of sustaining almost all the biological ecosystems on earth. It is the means whereby human beings are provided with 99 per cent of their food, as well as materials for clothing and shelter. Soil is a fundamental part of the natural environment within which human beings and all other life forms have to exist. In the short-term, soil is a non-renewable resource; if lost through erosion or damaged by chemical pollution or physical degradation, it is only re-developed at great expense or over a period of many decades or centuries. The Rennes meeting concluded that many of the problems encountered in the use of the world's soils cannot be solved by soil science alone; it is necessary to adopt an interdisciplinary approach which draws together both bio-physical and social aspects. Thus, it is imperative to take into consideration the political, legal, social, economic and financial framework within which the soils are being used. To enable this to be done efficiently it must be recognized that soil problems are not isolated phenomena; they are part of a web of interaction between the natural environment and human society. Soil science still has a vital role to play in the fight to stop environmental degradation and the world community will always need information on soils. In the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro June 1992), land occupies a central and fundamental role for sustainable development, and it includes the soils, minerals, water and biota. This comprises the essence of an integrated holistic approach, through a coordination of the sectoral planning and management activities concerned with the various aspects of land use and land resources. This perception of the significant position of the soil in ecosystems is accepted by many scientists, administrators and experts at national and international levels. The Global Terrestrial Observation System (GTOS) could be considered as example of this new acceptance. Supported by the United Nations, the GTOS system considers the soil an important element of ecosystems to be monitored for a long time. Other environmental research programmes, building upon the concept of \"benchmark soils\" developed in USA in 1960s, are requested to participate in this international endeavour. Moreover, the new political conventions, such as are currently being negotiated on Desertification, demand a direct involvement of DCs to create their own strategies for the environment at national, regional and international levels. This implies a change of attitude by researchers in DCs and elsewhere, and particularly by those scientists who are interested in soils as a natural resource. ",
        "BRAINSTORMING ORGANIZATION The discussion in Harare was a brainstorming meeting. The Rennes booklet, \"New Challenges for Soil Research in Developing Countries : a holistic approach\", formed the basis for the approach and discussions. In stage I of the workshop, pairs of delegates, one EC and one SADC national, were asked to develop an analysis of an area or ecosystem (based on the Rennes booklet and on the \"Macro-Micro relationship scheme to the use of land and soil resources\"- see appendix I ) to a soil-related problem chosen by the SADC delegate. A brief document was then prepared and presented to all meeting participants. From these 12 documents a number of key words ( 180) were selected and from these eight topics for further discussion were identified. Of these eight items, a first draft of specific recommendations, for researchers and decision makers, was identified by groups of 3 to 4 participants. Through open discussion in plenary session, specific suggestions and amendments were raised, allowing a new version to be prepared which was finally approved. An editorial committee was named to finalize the proceedings in two forms : a short booklet with the main recommendations and a more detailed book with all the contributions and papers prepared during the brainstorming workshop. SALIENT ISSUES FOR SOIL RESEARCH AND USE The workshop explored the ways in which the soil resource could be used on a sustainable basis within the social and economic framework of the SADC countries. The issues relevant to soil science were discussed and the related issues of education, training, role of agricultural extension services and possibilities of co-operation in science and technology between institutions of the SADC countries and Europe identified. It was recognized that the social conditions of the countries concerned, together with the marketing infrastructure, must also be incorporated into any policy which attempts to provide for the sustained use of the soil. It was apparent from the discussions and papers written during the workshop that : 1. Despite many scientific reports and practical studies, yields from small farmers' fields are declining and soil degradation is increasing. 2. The present use of the soil throughout the SADC countries is not always appropriate for sustainable agricultural production. 3. Soil degradation in the form of declining fertility, loss of organic matter, breakdown of soil structure and erosion is widespread throughout the region. 4. The case is made very strongly for the use of simple, well-known and inexpensive indigenous methods when they satisfactorily demonstrate that they can combat soil degradation, co-operating with the farmers rather than imposing regulations upon them. 5. For this to be successful, it would be necessary in most cases to strengthen the agricultural extension services and to provide suitable training and demonstrations to encourage small farmers to adopt a more conservation-based form of husbandry. ",
        "6. Improved soil care would enable the effective use of fertilizers on arable lands and crop yields would be increased. On pastures grazing should be controlled to allow recovery of the plants and an increase of the biomass; a case is made for fertilization of areas of grazing land to improve the standard of fodder thus raising the standard of animal health. Fuelwood plots and/or agro-forestry practices should be encouraged to arrest the deforestation which is occurring. 7. The need to raise the living standards of rural communities across the SADC region should begin with the adoption of sound soil conservation policies able to increase productivity in the short-term, developed at local level and where necessary encouraged and re-enforced by a national framework provided by Government. 8. Assuming that the necessary scientific knowledge can be generated through research, it is essential that the transfer of this knowledge in DCs takes place using the local research institutions and their research capability. This is critical for the process of adapting research findings to local conditions and for the implementation of participatory research schemes designed to finely tune new technology to specific social and economic conditions. ",
        "SUMMARY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS As part of the effort to define a comprehensive research strategy for co-operation in soil science within the SADC countries and for all other interested organisations or countries, the workshop identified eight topics of wide interest to many people. Statements about these topics, which were worked upon independently by groups, are presented in the following sections, but each one should be considered only as a initial statement about which a broader discussion among all researchers and soil scientists in the SADC and the international community can take place. Soil degradation causes productivity decline, degrades environment and the social fabric. Problems of soil degradation have contributed to the decline in soil productivity in SADC countries. This has resulted in a low standard of living, especially for the small farmers. In economic terms, decreased yields, coupled with high input costs have led to very low incomes which have had a negative impact on the social fabric of rural communities. Social insecurity in rural areas leads to family disruption and the migration of the younger, able-bodied people to the cities, causing a shortage of labour on the farms and social problems in the cities. It is recommended that : 1. The most effective way to prevent soil degradation would come through better information. Farmers should be made aware of its causes and consequences as well as methods of prevention and solutions to the problem. 2. There is a need to appraise the full extent of soil degradation at a national level, followed by recognition of the types present on the farm scale. 3. There is a need to take an holistic approach in the training of researchers, soil scientists, socio-economists and extension workers at both national and regional levels. 4. There is an urgent need to raise the awareness of policy-makers in respect of the damage that will be done to the national soil resource if soil degradation and fertility decline are not checked. 5. Traditional methods of soil and water conservation should be further researched and optimized in the development of sustainable agricultural production, combined with protection of the environment. Arrest of soil fertility decline in SADC countries : A must ! There is an urgent need to raise the general awareness of farmers about the slow insidious decline in fertility. However, the problem is not simply the physical loss of plant nutrients, rather the whole social environment of the small farmer should be taken into consideration in any attempt to remedy the decline in soil fertility. The following strategies are recommended for remedying the situation : ",
        "1. Research into cropping systems, soil and water management, husbandry and techniques that can be afforded and accepted by the farmers. 2. Improved educational and training opportunities for farmers to enable small farmers to adopt practices which improve and maintain fertility, e.g. terracing, mulching, and conservation tillage. 3. Social support and education, especially in the field of family planning. 4. Financial support for necessary inputs to stop fertility decline and improve crop yields. 5. Develop opportunities for off-farm income-generating activities, e.g. food processing to absorb and retain labour in rural areas. Defy Drought with Soil and Water Management ! The institutional, economic, environmental and practical problems of soil-water management must be addressed urgently and in an integrated fashion. Not only will productivity be improved, but also the ability of small farmers to withstand the effects of drought will increase and their standard of living will rise. The recommendations suggested include : 1. The institutional, economic, environmental and social conditions associated with small farmers must urgently be addressed. 2. An important part of this enquiry must be a review of the effect of these parameters on the farmers ability to effectively manage soil and water resources on the land. 3. Practical measures such as the use of tie-ridges, mulching, zero tillage, agro-forestry, strip cultivation, inter-cropping and cover crops should be encouraged. Such measures will promote soil moisture conservation, control soil erosion and enhance household food security. 4. Governmental institutions should assist with overall planning and watershed management to encourage infiltration into aquifers, thus increasing the security of water supplies. Overgrazing in these areas should be controlled. 5. Governments should tackle the issue of land tenure and put in place the social and economic policies which would enable farmers to optimise techniques for better and sustainable returns from their land. Urgent action required to stop soil erosion ! Soil erosion is widespread in the SADC countries with some areas losing over 85 tonnes per hectare per season. There is clearly an urgent need to control the problem. As erosion is so prevalent, it is necessary for governmental action to address the question of land tenure, as well to introduce policies which will influence land use so that erosion is reduced. 1. The focus of research should be on the development of intervention methods that are based on improved agricultural systems which increase soil productivity, but which ensure sustainability. ",
        "2. Specific attention should be paid to methods of control as usually they are acceptable to the farmers. They are easy to incorporate into existing farming systems and they are cost effective. It is necessary for the farmers to participate in the implementation and testing of well-tried and new ideas to stop soil erosion. 3. Government agencies should be responsible for the acquisition, storage and retrieval of data at national level to enable comparative studies to be made. Facilities should be made available for data exchange at regional, national and international levels. 4. Government policy, supported by legislation, should encourage training and development so that farmers are able to benefit from research findings through the advice of the extension services. In some cases it will be desirable to strengthen the agricultural extension service and increase the institutional capacity at different levels. Soil care brings continuing success to small farmers. Adoption of soil conservation measures is urgently needed in many of the SADC countries to arrest the loss of valuable soil reserves. It is not someone else's problem, but one with which all farmers should be concerned. The farmers should be supported by agricultural research and extension services and government policies, otherwise the security of food supplies will be compromised. The panel considered soil conservation and suggested the following recommendations : A. Soil conservation and land use. 1. Knowledge of soils and soil conservation should be given more weight in planning and land use. 2. Specific attention should be paid to the land tenure system. 3. Conservation measures should be adapted to land quality, land utilization type and overall ecosystems. B. Relationships and strategies with farmers. 1. Farmers should be involved in soil conservation at all stages. 2. Farmers should make greater use of indigenous technology. 3. Socio-economic constraints should be taken into account. 4. Conservation projects which are socially acceptable to the user farmers should be developed. 5. Conservation practices should be integrated within agricultural systems in a viable and economic manner. C. Evaluation and actions. 1. Lessons should be learnt from past successes and failures of soil conservation measures already implemented. 2. Measures for soil conservation should aim for continuity using low input technology for a sustainable soil management. ",
        "Indigenous techniques as tools in soil and water conservation. Policy recommendations and strategies are needed to empower people to use their own creativity and methods or technology to improve the management of soil and water conservation. Validating their own knowledge and experience will enable people to accept and care for their own environment, create self confidence and provide the basis for experimentation and the creation of a sustainable livelihood from the land. It is recommended that a research agenda be compiled to implement the following : 1. Compile an inventory of indigenous soil and water conservation techniques used in different natural environments and farming systems in the region. 2. Analyze why certain traditional techniques are successful and others are not. 3. Investigate techniques that were used in the past and to assess their present usefulness. 4. Study possible improvements of indigenous techniques. 5. Develop a bottom-up and farmer to farmer approach in extension services. Boost extension services to improve food security ! Many SADC countries already have agricultural extension services. These services should be made effective and their staff should encourage small farmers to introduce and improve upon their recommendations. Although not exhaustive, the following recommendations discussed during the panel meeting were considered of importance : 1. Where available, indigenous soil terminology should be incorporated in soil survey and linked to established (inter)national soil classification systems (e.g. Adaptive Research Planning Team (1989) Misamfu, Zambia). 2. National soil or land resource institutions, in co-operation with extension services should conduct workshops to identify constraints and to strengthen the information use/flow between agricultural entities at district and provincial level. The information should include the land resources maps/reports, benchmark soil information and results from agricultural experimental stations (e.g. District level workshops organized by Kenya Soil Survey, 1992 and 1993). 3. Farmers should have easy access to short specific agricultural training courses at lower and middle educational levels. Soil-related matters should be brought into these courses with adequate concern for local soil conditions and techniques of interest to the farmer, such as land preparation, soil and water conservation, soil sampling for fertility testing, etc. 4. An active role of the farmers in the definition of research programmes/targets should be ensured. 5. Existing educational opportunities and transport facilities for extension staff should be improved, including an adequate operational budget. ",
        "6. Agricultural Universities should play an active role in extension activities by linking to an existing service, or helping to create one of one does not exist. In addition, co-operation between other agricultural institutions having research and dissemination tasks should be encouraged. Holistic resource management to combat poverty ! An holistic view of the soil and its environmental setting reveals that relatively minor improvements in soil management could alleviate rapidly the impoverished state of many small scale farmers throughout the SADC region. The following recommendations were made for improved soil management to combat poverty : On cultivated fields : 1. Rapid adoption of known, effective soil erosion control techniques. 2. Use of crops which leave plentiful crop residues and also fix nitrogen. 3. Financial provision should be made for appropriate artificial fertilizers to be used to raise crop yields above the subsistence levels currently obtained. 4. Effective use of relevant services to popularise improved soil management techniques. On pastures : 1. Subdivision of communal grazing with cattle pastured on a rotational basis. 2. Broadcast of limited amounts of fertilizer to improve the quality of grazing lands. 3. Encourage the use of fuelwood plantations and agroforestry techniques to provide increased fodder to help cattle survive the dry season and longer drought periods. 4. Provision of veterinary support to improve cattle health. APPROACHES FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMME A final exercise undertaken by the workshop was to indicate an order of priority for future activities, to be taken into consideration by international organisations, SADC and any other interested countries. Reviewing the discussions which had taken place during the workshop, eighteen topics were suggested by the participants. Strong support was provided for further work on benchmark soils, regional information centres, regional workshops, and development of a research network. Less support was given for a regional newsletter, case studies and development of common research activities. Other activities mentioned included development of a soil information system, compilation of an inventory of research results, exchange of students, post-graduate programmes, inter- university agreements, promotion of a SACCAR-European relationship and formation of a steering committee. ",
        "FINAL REMARKS Soils and problems of their sustained use are not isolated phenomena, they are part of an intricate web of interactions between different aspects of the natural environment and human beings. There is a need to identify problem soils which are difficult to manage and to develop suitable strategies for their successful management. Equally, widespread \"benchmark\" soils must be identified so that the results of scientific experimentation may be extrapolated with confidence over a wide area. Research sites on either of these soils could help with local, regional or even world environmental monitoring and management. Taking into account the total area of 5,728,000 km 2 and a total population of 77,200,000, the SADC region has an average population density of between 13 and 14 persons per square kilometre. The quality of the soil, elevation of the land and climatic conditions (despite the droughts that periodically affect the region) do not justify as dramatic a claim for intervention in comparison with areas such as Burkina Faso, India or Cameroon where the density of population is much higher (3-400 persons per square kilometre). Moreover, the rural density in the SADC region is surely less than I 4 persons per square kilometre because of rural immigration to the towns. The areas described as case studies identify vulnerable areas which are at risk and where it is requested a specific intervention has to be made with the issue of sustainability. These areas can be considered as representative of the whole ecosystem, and they can be made specific sites for intensive studies. These are the areas which must be monitored to follow any changes in their condition. In other words, they must be considered as benchmark sites where their totality has to be observed and not just the soil component. The researchers who participated in the workshop hope to have created a useful tool for politicians and soil scientists of SADC, providing a common framework for a fruitful dialogue about the use of soil and natural ecosystems in a sustainable manner. This framework and dialogue will permit a pragmatic incorporation of the growing international inter-dependence that will affect the life of all SADC inhabitants, including the broadening of SADC membership by the incorporation of the Republic of South Africa and its existing research capacity. The participants were aware that the workshop was only a first necessary step in the right direction, but that there is still a long way to go before the path to real sustainable development is achieved. The co-operation of all interested people is not only requested, but is absolutely fundamental for any progress to be made. If this document is used, criticized, amended, ameliorated and modified, it means that the main goal of the workshop has been attained.

        "On these elevated, gently undulating plains, a common form of relief is low rises separated by shallow valleys, referred to as dambos which eventually combine to form tributaries of the major rivers. The major rivers of southern Africa, the Zambesi and Limpopo, have interesting courses; in their headwaters they drain the upland plateaux, but then plunge over spectacular waterfalls and pass through deep gorges before crossing the lowlands on the way to the sea. Climate : Rainfall across the SADC countries ranges from plentiful to inadequate, and it varies in season and reliability of occurrence. The lowest rainfall amounts and most unreliable rains occur in parts of Namibia and Botswana. The most reliable and plentiful rains occur in northern Zimbabwe, northern Mozambique, Tanzania and Malawi, where the most satisfactory conditions for agriculture are found. Mean January temperatures range from 20 to 25\u00b0C and those of July from 10 to 1 5\u00b0. The major climatic regions of Southern Africa are shown in Fig. 2. Where the land on the plateaux has not been cleared for cultivation, the miombo woodlands are the most extensive type of natural vegetation. The low-lying dambos are lines of seepage and so are moister, having fewer trees and are usually grass covered. Fig. 2.

The recent drought conditions in southern Africa emphasised the need to lift the economic status of the many small farmers of the region. In most years there has been sufficient produce from the land to sustain the population, but two consecutive years of inadequate rainfall have emphasised the delicate balance of the people's existence. At the present time, agricultural systems are not in equilibrium with the soil and so degradation is occurring. Cultivation decreases the soil organic matter content which is not being replaced, resulting in structural deterioration and the potential for damaging erosion. Together, these reduce fertility resulting in declining yields and an agricultural system which is not sustainable in the medium and long term. ",
        "In environmental terms, crop production in the SADC countries is very much at the mercy of the rainfall; when the rains fail, so do the crops. Although moisture exerts a dominant control, there is also a significant soil dimension to the problem of low rural living standards. By adoption of a sustainable system of farming through Improvement of soil and water management techniques and increased use of agricultural extension services, it should be possible to raise rural living standards across the SADC region. Problems also exist on the grazing lands and woodlands where uncontrolled grazing, fire and erosion are degrading the natural resources of both the soil and vegetation. ",

        "ADDRESS OF WELCOME L.R. Ndlovu Dean, Faculty of Agriculture University of Zimbabwe I would like to welcome you all to the workshop on Benchmark Soil Sites which will run from the 16th to the 22nd of November, 1993, in Harare, Zimbabwe. Soil is a natural resource, non renewable in the short term or very difficult to renew, and expensive either to reclaim or to improve following erosion or physical and chemical degradation. This natural resource is a legacy for the coming generations and therefore, it is our duty to maintain it for the future. The task of all people concerned with soil must be to direct their interests not just to the physical (soil physicist), chemical (soil chemist) and biological (soil biologist) aspects but also to those environmental, economic, social, legal and technical aspects that affect soil use, that is to adopt a HOLISTIC APPROACH. The concept of HOLISM at first strikes most people as a bit philosophical and too ethereal to have much use. The farmer ploughs his new wheat field. The rancher clears brush. The forester sprays bark beetles. The engineer designs a dam. The economist advises government. The pedologist (soil surveyor) maps soils. They put the utmost concentration and energy into their chosen tasks, rarely reflecting that they work within a greater whole, which their actions affect, slowly, cumulatively, and often dramatically. The need for a new holistic approach for those involved in soil research in Developing Countries in order to solve problems such as erosion and salinization can not be over emphasized. Soil research should take cognisance of the views and ideas of the beneficiaries, that is, the socio-economic dimension, to be of any use to the end users. This meeting is a follow-up of the activities of an EC-funded workshop, promoting a holistic approach for future soil research in developing countries. The aim of the meeting is to investigate the need, feasibility and policy of creating a network of benchmark soil sites to evaluate environmental degradation. The establishment of benchmark soil sites has the advantage of providing data on environmental degradation which are scarce or lacking in Africa. Hopefully, such a database will contain all available information on topography, soil attributes, climatic parameters, vegetation, land use, population (both human and animal population), infrastructure, as well as socio-economic factors. This information should be linked to particular geographic locations so that it should be possible to estimate the risk of land degradation for each location. It is therefore up to the scientists gathered for this \"brain storming session\" to come up with ideas on the feasibility of establishing a network of benchmark soil sites in Africa and the policy to be followed. I would like to thank the sponsors and the organisers of this workshop for enabling this meeting to take place. It is an honour for the University of Zimbabwe's Faculty of Agriculture to be your host on this occasion. ",
        "BENCHMARK SOIL SCIENCE IN THE SADC REGION J. Trehy Agricultural Advisor Commission of the European Communities, Harare It is a pleasure to be asked to address this meeting on behalf of the Delegation of the Commission of the European Community in Zimbabwe. The Commission, through its Directorate General for Development, has programmes under the Lom\u00e9 Conventions in all SADC Countries, and the majority of these programmes are in the rural development sector. There is also a regional programme of grant aid under the Lom\u00e9 Convention with SADC Countries and under the last Convention signed at Lom\u00e9 in I 990, the 5-year programme was allocated over 120 million ECU from the European Development Fund. The programmes, or projects that are formulated, have as the main objective assistance to smallholder crop and pastoral farmers in the poorer areas. Through the supervision of these projects, we in the Commission Delegations see at first hand the problems of soil degradation, erosion, overcropping and siltation. Also with increasing population, the pressure on land in the SADC region becomes greater, this gives rise to soil degradation, loss of fertility and a resultant threat to food security in the region. While it is hoped that this meeting will examine the important role of scientific research in resolving the conflicts that exist between long term economic growth and the conservation of natural resources, it should be remembered that there is an ever present need to link and translate scientific research data into practical messages that are relevant to farmers in managing the lands from which they earn their livelihood. It is very necessary to carry out soil surveys, compile soil maps, write up soil descriptions and carry out soil analyses, but if these are not transmitted from researcher to extension service in messages which are realistic in terms of small scale farmers' capabilities, the results will not assist in poverty eradication and sustainable development. We would like to compliment the organisers of the meeting in assembling so many talented people from the SADC Countries and from Europe here in Zimbabwe to discuss this most important subject. We look to you as \"innovators\" who will look at the problems of soil conservation in the region, and propose solutions to some of the problems which are now becoming serious in the context of continuing food security in SADC Countries. We commend the University of Zimbabwe for coming forward to host this gathering and carrying on the tradition of being the foremost institution in the region in the study of soil science. We will follow your deliberations keenly and feel sure that the benefits to the farmers of the region will be very rewarding. ",
        "OPENING ADDRESS BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF SACCAR S.C. Muchena African Centre for Fertilizer Development, Harare Mr Chairman/Chairperson, Representative of the EC Delegate in Harare, Dr Catizzone, representative of the University of Zimbabwe distinguished participants, Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalfof Dr Martin Kyomo the Director of SACCAR, it is my honourthis morning to deliver the opening address to this important Benchmark Soil Sites Workshop. I have been assigned a dual role : first as a representative of SACCAR during this Opening Session and secondly as an expert participant in the brainstorming activity. I will therefore be wearing two hats this week. I will remind you which one 1 am wearing when I make interventions. Coming from the African Centre for Fertilizer Development (ACFD) the theme of the Workshop is of great interest to us. We have in fact during the past year or so given some thought to strategies for soil fertility improvement for sustainable agriculture and protection of the environment. Agriculture dominates the economies of the majority of the SADC Countries. However, its success is currently hampered by a number of environmental and socio-economic constraints, such as drought, soil infertility, and inadequate investment in agricultural development services. As a result, many countries in the region are currently facing serious food, hunger and nutrition problems. Population growth rate has exceeded the annual rate of increase in agricultural production over the last 40 years, and so the annual per capita growth rate of agricultural production has been negative (-0.31 %) with serious economic and food security consequences. For example, between 1975 and 1988, cereal imports into the region increased by 132% while food production per capita has decreased by 16%. Although population per hectare of arable land increased by about 50% over the same period, cereal yields per hectare have not increased and in some countries these are actually declining. The Problem Among the environmental constraints, soil infertility caused by soil degradation is currently one of the most serious. Estimates have indicated that only 4.5% of the soil resources in the SADC region have no serious limitations for crop production. Furthermore, productive soils continue to be lost through mismanagement, erosion, encroachment of the desert, and deforestation. The national systems do recognize the problem; for example a recent SADC report cited increasing use of marginal lands, accelerating soil degradation and erosion, escalating deforestation, expanding desertification, excessive sedimentation of rivers, and declining biodiversity as common problems that must be tackled. The soil cover of the region is dominated by highly weathered and strongly leached low- activity clay (LAC) soils with major constraints for intensive continuous cropping. In these LAC soils, soil fertility and physical properties are highly dependent on soil organic ",
        "matter. A sizeable proportion of the region lies within the < 700 mm marginal rainfall, zone. The proportion of each country found in this zone varies considerably, ranging from more than 65% of Botswana and Namibia to less than 10% of Malawi and Zambia. The relatively low rainfall, coupled with annual long dry periods, has implications for soil organic matter accumulation and successful soil management. A large proportion of the soils have a low organic matter content ( 1 % organic carbon), are generally deficient in the major crop nutrients (particularly nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur), and have poor physical properties (eg reduced water conductivity), resulting in reduced rainfall infiltration and hence increased run off. In these LAC soils, where the organic matter content is also low, there is little buffering capacity and soil degradation starts much earlier in the cropping cycle. Since the buffering capacity of the soil is low, soil acidity also is often a problem. Thus, in the highly weathered and leached LAC soils, nutrient reserves are usually low to very low. The low input/low output cropping systems practised in the region's rural areas use little or no fertilizer, hence they fail to maintain an equilibrium between nutrient supply and plant nutrient requirement. In traditional shifting cultivation, soil fertility accumulated during a fallow period and it was augmented by the practice of adding ash from branches and brushwood which was heaped on a patch of land and fired. In this process phosphate, potash, liming materials and absorptive charcoal were added to the soil from the ashes, while the sterilization of the soil by the heat of the fire increased the availability of nutrients from soil organic matter and reduced competition from microorganisms and weeds. When properly practised the system provided sustained yields over short periods. However, because population has increased, there is greater pressure on the land and so this cropping system can no longer be widely practised. With little or no fertilizer being applied to maintain soil fertility or replenish nutrients taken up during continuous cropping, the poorly buffered sandy and LAC soils are being progressively \"mined\". Sustainable crop yields can now only be achieved by regular additions of nutrients from chemical fertilizers and/or organic residues such as manure. The depleted soils often have multiple deficiencies of nutrients, commonly \u039d, \u03a1 and S, but in extreme cases \u039a and Mg as well. It is estimated that in Zimbabwe and Malawi as much as 80% of the cropped land is affected by soil degradation. Recently released figures show that large-scale farmers in Zimbabwe are losing up to one half of their applied fertilizers in sheet erosion, and more than 30% of the seasonal rainfall as run off. These are the better managed farms ! Soil eroded from arable land and grazing land is deposited in dams, filling them with silt. Some dams are already so silted that they are useless as water reservoirs. It is not easy to estimate the costs of soil degradation on a regional basis, but information from Zimbabwe illustrates for arable lands alone, the cost is Z$ 240 million (ECu 32.5 million). If the loss of revenue from the degraded lands and the silting of dams are taken into account, the total cost of soil degradation can be high indeed. It is apparent that there is an urgent need to restore productivity to degraded soils, to conserve the productive soil remaining, and to prevent the spread of soil degradation to those areas not ",
        "yet affected. Also, more emphasis should be put on developing strategies that will ensure sustainable use of the land resources. The Solution Usually, farmers are aware of the consequences of erosion and soil degradation on their crop yields and wish to prevent the damage. Managing soils to increase and maintain fertility requires achieving a balance between loss of nutrients through crop uptake and replacement of nutrients through the use of manure, inorganic fertilizer, and other sources. Basic research and extension data relevant to farming systems operated in the region now exists for most of the countries. It is at the level of adaptive and applied research that major gaps are encountered. It is in this regard that the Benchmark Soil Sites in Africa which it is proposed to formulate should have its greatest value. It will enable the evaluation and practical demonstration of soil fertility management options and cropping strategies for the benefit of the smallholder farmers of the region to take place. The strategies should not only aim at minimizing environmental degradation and restoring productivity of depleted lands, but should also aim to alleviate other crop production constraints which occur in the region. Central to these strategies would be to find solutions for soil infertility and moisture stress problems. Priority should now be given to promoting and speeding-up the transfer of the accumulated research knowledge to the farmers. In the traditional Alvord cropping system, once practised widely in Zimbabwe's communal areas, soil fertility was maintained by the use of manure and a legume in the rotation. In this system 10 or so tonnes of manure per hectare was applied to the first maize crop to be followed by another maize crop, a legume and finally a small grain. This was usually a cost-effective tool for maximizing returns. Besides maintaining soil fertility, the rotation system was also effective in controlling pests and diseases. Regrettably, this cropping system is no longer being practised. But we all know that farmers are rational, we should endeavour to offer them options; options that are sensitive to socio-economic changes. Sustainable systems should be devised for different crops, input levels and agro-ecological zones of the region. Restoration of fertility often requires increasing carbon as well as nitrogen. There is good scientific evidence that manure is the best amendment; it provides carbon, prevents acidification, and it generally provides a balance of all nutrients. Unfortunately, manure is seldom available in sufficient quantities on the farms, it is bulky to transport, and there is no formal market for it. Recognizing that manure is in short supply and that it can only become scarcer as pressure on land increases, researchers in Eastern Kenya developed a successful fertilizer-augmented soil enrichment system involving manure, legumes, composted weeds and fertilizer. This system could be modified further to allow for the addition of moderate amounts of liming materials to alleviate low pH related soil infertility problems. Traditionally, the practice of ash culture provided liming materials and absorptive charcoal to raise soil pH. However, as pointed out earlier, this cropping system can no longer be practised because population pressure does not allow the land to be fallowed. ",
        "As their soil productivity declines, smallholder farmers are realizing that some fertilizer may be necessary and that it may be better to invest in fertilizer than to face food insecurity. It has become apparent that adequate food production in Africa can only be achieved by a balanced use of biological and artificial fertilizers. Although fertilizer prices are increasing, the use of fertilizers in the region is also increasing. The studies in Kenya cited earlier indicate, emphasis need not be to rely on high inputs of fertilizers but to realize that there will always be cases when fertilizer application, however small, would help increase or maintain yields. For example, if the soil is inherently low in phosphorus, incorporating crop residues or manure derived from the same soil would not substantially increase soil phosphate. In such a case addition of small quantities of \u03a1 may help restore soil fertility. The emphasis of recent research in the region has increased the options that can be offered to the smallholder farmer; some of these are summarised : - Agro forestry can help to recycle minerals, increase biomass production, provide green manure (and fodder) and mulch, and reduce soil erosion. - Work on the use of indigenous agro-minerals, would help identify locally available, and possibly cheaper, alternative nutrient and soil amendment sources. - The use of low cost soil conservation practices to control soil erosion has also been tried. A good example here, is the use of v\u00e9tiver grass on its own or in combination with physical structures. To restore the productivity of depleted arable lands is a multidimensional challenge. As far as Is known, there have been only a few efforts by African institutions to confront this problem in practical terms. The central issue for this International Workshop on \"Benchmark Soil Central Site in Africa\" is how to achieve a good level of soil fertility and sustain it. This good level of soil fertility is not sufficient if it occurs in a couple of locations only, but it has to be achieved throughout the whole SADC region. Fertility is assumed to embrace the suitability of the whole environment for agricultural production, not only of the land, but of all the diverse characteristics of which we are aware. The main components of fertility are climate and the soil. However, a wider view is called for, based on the interaction of pedodimatic characteristics of the environment, production systems and the farming techniques used. Therefore within any region, the general agricultural conditions, population changes and agricultural policy in so far as they impinge directly or indirectly on the farming systems of the region will affect the level of soil fertility. This workshop is held at a very appropriate time for SACCAR and the Environment and Land Management Sector who are both seeking new initiatives and inputs into the soil and water management. SACCAR is currently looking at possibilities of developing a Regional Dryland Crops Research Institute which among' other activities will be expected to embrace the wider issue of applied research on soil fertility maintenance. The African Centre for Fertilizer Development (ACFD) was established by a convention of the OAU, with the ultimate objective of stimulating the production and use of ",
        "fertilizers in order to increase crop yields and farmers incomes in rural Africa, to reduce widespread hunger and malnutrition and to make an impact on rural poverty. This centre would also naturally be interested in the deliberations and outcome of this workshop. I wish to thank the organizers of this meeting, and the EC in particular, for sponsoring this Workshop on a subject central to our hearts. The EC has always been a staunch supporter of SADC programmes of action. We are naturally delighted to have another opportunity for collaboration with them. Finally I must express my gratitude to the University of Zimbabwe for hosting this Workshop. With these words, I wish this Workshop every success. Thank you. ",

        "SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION ON SOIL SCIENCES IN THE SADC REGION ELEMENTS FOR A DEBATE M. Catizzone Scientific Officer STD-3 Programme European Community, Brussels Introduction In June 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm declared : For the purpose of attaining freedom in the world of nature, man must use knowledge to build, in collaboration with nature, a better environment (United Nations, 1976). The entire scientific community was thus solicited to work on the identification of major issues for preserving the natural world for the benefit of present and future generations of human life. This stimulated the growth and awareness of the concept of \"sustainable development\". Although these words may have different interpretations, they clearly indicate the need to modify the current principles governing the relationship between mankind and world resources. A major consensus was reached in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (United Nations, 1992) where \"environment\" and \"development\" were declared to be strongly linked and interdependent. It is useful to recall Article 5 of the UNCED Declaration that claims : All States and all people shall co-operate in the essential task of eradicating poverty as an indespensable requirement for sustainable development, in order to decrease the disparities in standards of living and better meet the needs of the majority of the people of the world. The Vicious Circle Poverty eradication is a recurrent principle of the UNCED Declaration. The urgency required in its implementation by many Developing Countries (DCs) is clearly underlined. This situation is shown schematically in figure I. - Human degradation affects all DCs as well as many countries defined as industrialized (in recent international documents the words \"poor\" and \"rich\" are increasingly used to distinguish the two realities of development). - poverty means backwardness, recognition of which implies an endeavour to escape from a degraded situation. - Automatically, this endeavour produces emigration, chaotic urbanization, and other consequences including religious fanaticism, radicalism, nationalism, racism, rejection and other drastic reactions, such as violence and slavery, against the weakest section of the population.

        "Meanwhile, the rich/industrialized world has adopted in some cases a short-sighted vision of the \"vicious circle\", considering the DCs either as a potential market (advantage of which can be taken to export pollution and use made of cheap labour for labour intensive production), or to which its own way of life may be exported as a means of preserving its present leading position (but this is accompanied by the unwanted aspects of corruption, speculation and unproductive revenues). - The only possibility for survival for the population in many DCs is linked to (over)exploitation of natural resources, which are mostly limited and not easily renewable. This inevitably produces deforestation, land degradation, loss of fertility, major extensions of urbanization, loss of biodiversity, all of which result in more poverty and increased human degradation. With these points in mind, it is evident that it is necessary to develop a new paradigm with which to respond to the world survival challenge. A major effort is required of researchers, because they must provide new and safe ways to use world resources. Researchers are asked to translate the principle of \"sustainable development\" into pragmatic actions. This new scenario makes the researchers re-define their role and their on-going research activities, if until now their own disciplines provided the required parameters to carry out the necessary scientific work, they are now forced to go far beyond the disciplinary limits to rid themselves of old biases and to create new conceptual frameworks. Isolation of Soil Science The challenge of this new scenario may provoke two kinds of mutually opposite reactions: 1. that this idea is only a temporary fashion and soon all will return to the mono- disciplinary view of science. 2. the challenge can be accepted and work begin to build a new multi-disciplinary approach for further research. The second reaction was that of the water specialists. In the Dublin statement they put forward new guiding principles stating that : Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good. This was the final outcome of a long process in which the normal water disciplines were reconsidered and where water changed from being a \"natural resource\" to an \"economic good\" (ICWE, 1992). The new water paradigm laid the foundations for new research initiatives and we have witnessed a flourishing of meetings, congresses and symposia launching new research ideas. The international organizations have supported this activity and it is not a coincidence that the World Bank (1993) described in its policy paper the \"Comprehensive Approach\" as the new way to act for this economic resource. ",
        "The majority of soil scientists seem to have opted for the first reaction and preferred their \"splendid\" isolation. They accepted links with other disciplines, but always related to specific aspects concerning soils : the soil physicist has collaborated with the micro- morphologists, but has had a strong reluctance to work with an anthropologist or an economist. Professor A Wild ( 1989), in his presidential address to the British Society of Soil Science in 1988 said, As earth scientists we can take a broader view; we can help to preserve a healthy environment and can also assist the work of archaeologists, ecologisti, geologists and others. Despite his call, the majority of soil scientists in UK and elsewhere still independently continue to study soil characteristics in isolation. For this reason, soil scientists were excluded from the international effort concerning the preservation of the natural environment. The International Context Agenda 21 of the Rio Conference does not contain a specific section concerning the soil. In chapter 10, \"Integrated Approach to the Planning and Management of Land Resources\" the temi land was defined as a physical entity in terms of its topography and spatial nature; a broader integrative view also includes natural resources : the soils, mineral water and biota the land comprises. This statement goes on to ask international organisations to develop a different approach to land (of which soil is an important element). One example that deserves to be mentioned for its soil science component is the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS)(Heal et al, 1993). This framework for world ecosystem monitoring should be based on an integrated, adequate site network and it should be able to detect changes in terrestrial ecosystem properties, populations and processes. An observing infrastructure should be capable of collating, analyzing, interpreting and disseminating the data gathered. Established on a world scale, this initiative should provide useful information on the present situation and the evolution of defined ecosystems in which soil is one of the main elements. GTOS is not an isolated programme, but related to the activities of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) (Williamson, 1992), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and other specific UN environmental programmes, such as the Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) (UNEP, 1993), the Global Integrating Monitoring (GIM), Global Resource Information Database (GRID) etc. These are not the only international actions, the USA has set up a \"Benchmark Sites Network for Evolution of Environmental Degradation\" (especially for Africa - ABSNEED), the Swedish International development Authority, (SIDA, 1993) - created the Regional Soil Conservation Unit in Nairobi, the World Association of Soil and Water Conservation created WOCAT, the World Overview of Conservation Activities and Technologies (Hurni et al. 1993), and many other interested groups are acting but are poorly co ordinated and still have a limited impact on the problems. ",
        "Is the New Paradigm Valid for Soil Science ? Are these the solutions required to re-integrate soil science in its new role ? There is still a gap. All the actions previously mentioned are conceived in the \"rich/industrialized\" countries and do not necessarily receive wide support and interest from the community of DCs. Also, the \"eradication of poverty\" concept until now has not been fully incorporated in these activities. There is still a need for a different international paradigm for development (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1990). Chambers (1993) identified a new paradigm, which is probably valid for soil science, at four interacting levels : - normative : development people-centred, men before things, poorer people before the less poor, weaker (physically vulnerable, isolated, powerless) before the less weak, women before men, children before adults, and so on; - conceptual : development was always considered from a static position \"A\" to a better condition \"B\", but development is a dynamic process to search for possible solutions to problems using, at best, all our knowledge and trying to maximise well-being in changing conditions; - empirical : the reality is very complex and interdependent with the possibility of very rapid change. The knowledge and organizational capacities of local communities is insufficiently recognized and exploited : - practical : it is imperative to stop believing that some crops and land treatments, implemented in totally different environments, will be able to solve world hunger. These few simple statements, still considered utopia a short time ago, are now more and more absorbed by the agreements ruling the relationships between DCs and industrialized countries. Soil scientists usually regard these arguments as only philosophical concepts with limited impact on the soil, but some researchers have already begun to demonstrate how to integrate the concept of poverty into other sciences. For example, Calkins et al ( 1992) have elaborated a simple three-dimensional mathematical model to measure well-being and poverty (Fig. 2). The Canadian researchers were able to establish a link between the constituents of happiness, self realization, well-being and the poverty threshold and the relevant sciences concerned with specific constituents (Table 1 ). This model was tested in totally different contexts and societies (e.g. drugdealers, Somalian farmers, ultra-liberal capitalists, communists etc) with encouraging results. Could soil scientists integrate and co operate with this research ? What concept of soil/land/earth should be incorporated in this model ? The Role of DC Soil Scientists If the situation is considered to be in a state of rapid change for all researchers, it is still more chaotic for the DC researchers/experts because of their relative isolation compared ",

        "with the mainstream of international discussion and thought. In the new world context (elimination of cold war, a new world order, GATT, debt crises, reduction of aid for development etc.), the DC researchers have the obligation to make their own innovations, to find their own solutions and to determine their own pathways. This obligation is stated in the draft of the \"Convention on Desertification\" (still being negotiated, upon the mandate of the UNCED-Rio Conference and probably to be finalized for June 1994). In it, the DCs are requested to clearly identify their own strategy and priorities, within the framework of national environmental policy and sub- regional and regional (supranational) action programmes to harmonize, complement and increase the efficiency and impact of the current efforts against drought and desertification. Of course, according to the principles of the Rio Conference, the human being must have a central role in each activity. With these premises, the DC researchers and especially the soil scientists, will be requested to act in the preparation and support of all the necessary steps to implement the Convention. They must be ready to indicate explicitly the real priorities for their country, and to be credible they must be in accord with the new identified integrated approach. The same request will be made to GTOS, and so there is a choice between a passive support of the implementation of an international site network, or an active participation in which the strategy and priorities covering different aspects of ecosystems, including soils, are integrated. The Action of the European Commission The \"Life Science and Technologies for Developing Countries, STD-3\", (CEC/DGXII, 1993) a research programme of the European Commission, moving in this direction, actively supported a meeting of a group of DC and European researchers at Rennes in France (Anon 1992). This group defined a fresh interdisciplinary approach, called \"Holistic\" (Fig. 3), as a new challenge for soil research in developing countries. The holistic approach was defined as the task of all people concerned with the soil to direct their interest, not just towards the physical, chemical and biological aspects, but also to those environmental economic, social, legal and technical aspects that affect soil use. In this context, the efficient and sustainable use of the soil is neither dependent upon the level of inputs into the soil, nor of the technology used to manage it. Three basic questions were posed : 1. What are the response functions in terms of crop yield over the medium/long term future to Improvements in soil status (texture, structure biotte content) when compared with the baseline represented by a continuation of the traditional system ? This implies that we will know how much labour and cost is involved in improving soils, and what are the expected returns on this capital investment to the farmer and society as a whole. 2. What could be the role of external inputs in increasing crop productivity and what would be the impact on labour productivity ? ",
        "Fig. 3. Reiteration of salient points resulting from a holistic approach \u25a0 Awareness and importance of existing documentation and information including local information: \u25a0 The existence of both potential and actual risks of land degradation in all its forms and in each land unit of land: \u25a0 The positive scientific elemetns of past and present methods of maintaining and managing soil and land quality, as well as the need to adapt current changing socio-economic conditions (\"lessons in sustainability from the past\"): \u25a0 The necessity to improve soil productivity on a sustainable basis, particularly in areas of population pressure: \u25a0 The need to obtain consistent and reliable data and improved comparability of soil and land information: \u25a0 The need to combine soil information with other data in order to achieve the succesful use of land: \u2022 The need to disseminate the results of research: - The need to assess the impact and acceptance of research in soil science on the human and physical environment; - The need to study the impact of the proposed methods on environment: - Acceptance of proposed solution by the community. 3. What is the impact of the lack of conservation practices on other resources (water, biodiversity, human health) and how could science and technology assist in the recovery of degraded soils ? The answers of the soil scientists meeting at Rennes are contained in the following fifteen basic considerations : i. Research needs to be identified by involving the local beneficiaries. ii. Several disciplines must be identified that together can try to solve the location-specific problems, while allowing scientists involved to do specific research when appropriate, iii. A balance between human needs and conservation of natural resources should be anticipated when identifying research needs, iv. Quality of research needs to be maintained, v. Adequate availability of research facilities must be ascertained, vi. Availability of resource information needs to be adequate, vii. Financial resources and infrastructural facilities must be ascertained, including the need for adequate mobility, viii. Strengthening of national research capabilities may be needed in order to ensure the continuity of research after project termination, ix. Training opportunities, especially on-the-spot training at all levels should be included, x. Research activities should not only lead to an improvement in the local environmental conditions, but also to improved standards of living of the local community, xi. Research results should be made available in a user-friendly manner, and should lead to policy-making and development planning at all levels, xii. Research results should be made available to the widest possible audience and, where applicable, be reported in scientific journals. ",
        "xiii. A cost benefit analysis should be made in order to provide for an efficient use of both internal and external resources, xiv. Consideration should be given to the explanation and transferability of research results, not only in other areas but also to other local workers, xv. Research should build upon indigenous empirical know-how as one of the means to better conservation of natural resources (principle of comparative advantage). If the Rennes meeting defined a new conceptual framework for soil science research, it missed the opportunity to have a clear overview of the micro- and macro- links, the importance of research on specific localities for specific matters and the relationships of soils and soil science in the context of the world community. These aspects have already been studied and defined by Blaikie ( 1989) providing a useful tool to identify a strategy which addresses the causes of land degradation. The scheme developed by Hurni ( 1993), based on the Blaikie concept (Fig. 4), explains an interdisciplinary and multi-level identification of the land degradation links with the various related perceptions. The need to verify pragmatically the new ideas If the newly identified concept was valid, the next step must be to check it within a specific DC area, attempting to incorporate it into the current international activities. Thus a researchers' group suggested that the holistic approach could be verified using the South African Development Community (SADC) countries, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, could it eventually be integrated into the African Benchmark Sites Network for Evaluation of Environmental degradation (ABSNEED) or in GTOS. The choice of the SADC area as a case study was acceptable for a few simple reasons : the existence of active groups of soil scientists in all SADC countries; the presence of a co-ordinating body for research, the Southern African Centre for Co-operation in Agricultural Research (SACCAR); diversity of agro-ecology (from desert to humid forest, and from tropical coastal plains to temperate highlands), diversity of economic structures, of natural resource base, of population density and of agricultural productivity (Figs. 5 St 6). Once approached, SACCAR promptly accepted the initiative and fully supported the idea of a workshop to be held in the Department of Soil Science in the University of Zimbabwe at Harare. Harare Brainstorming Workshop The main objective of the workshop was how to promote actively the use of soil resources for sustained social and economic development in the context of regional development, taking into account the specificity of individual countries or groups within a country. In the meantime, the main issues to be addressed by research (soils, socio-economic, environmental), advanced training, institution-building and possible co-operation between SADC countries; finally to discuss the aim for Science and Technologies and international co-operation (ABSNEED, GTOS, N-S Consortium of Universities, etc) must be discussed ",

        "and identified. The Rennes holistic approach and the Hurni scheme provide the basis for analysis and perform two operational roles : co-ordinating research and providing the encouragement for research and development to take place. The workshop will be conducted along group discussion lines, with two or three persons per group. The individual groups will report back to the workshop in full session. These group activities are to take place in two stages. The first stage is concerned with the broad environmental conditions, the second with more detailed considerations. Each group wasinvited to prepare a presentation for the workshop upon a pedological problem which is having an adverse effect on your region or country. Firststage, broad environmental considerations : Using the Rennes report (copies available in French, English and Spanish), and having the micro- macro- scheme in mind, consider soil problems of your area, their limiting factors (Climate, social customs, conditions of land holding, availability of labour and capital etc) for sustainable development. Consider also the scale of the problem and whether its characteristics are representative of a broad agro-ecologic zone. What degree of urgency do you see is needed to counter the ill effects of this problem ? On the basis of the presentations, the workshop will be requested to identify and discuss the most significant problems in the context of the SADC region. Second stage, detailed analysis of the area : The participants, having identified a limited number of problems and having in mind their descriptions of representative areas, are requested to work on how to promote soil use for sustained social and economic development (Fig. 7). The likely areas of interest to emerge will be sustainable use and prevention of resource degradation; areas where degradation is thought to be at risk and there is a need for surveillance; resilience and vulnerability of the soil to degradation under different levels of human pressure; ability of soils to recover once damaged; policies for reclamation, their costs and benefits; local and regional institutional strengthening to underpin resource management policies and to carry out monitoring; implications of global climatic change on local soils, agriculture and economic well-being. With this broad and common analysis, the participants will be requested to bring up their own main recommendations for researchers and decision-makers. Fig. 7. Requirements for a Case Study to verify the holistic approach Environmental and social variability Perception of scale and degree of urgency Impact must be representative of large area There must be presence of local institutions for research and development The economic implications on the case study should be included ",
        "Conclusion It has been mentioned that it is Imperative to focus the researcher's attention on the causes limiting the development and capacity of the SADC environment to support life and all human activities. The major output of this meeting should be the awareness of the SACCAR researchers to participate in the creation of their own strategy to develop the region, creating a common scientific knowledge for a sustainable development able to organize, co-ordinate and channel the external and internal requests and interventions including the foreseeable enlargement of SADC with the Republic of South Africa. The creation of this common approach will facilitate the incorporation of present and future links with the international community working for the eradication of poverty and improvement of peoples lives within a viable environmental situation. The wish is that this exercise should constitute a new, fruitful example for other DC areas. References Anon., 1992.

        "AN HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SOIL SCIENCE E.M. Bridges International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) Wageningen, The Netherlands Introduction There has been much concern expressed privately amongst soil scientists in Europe during the past decade as soil research organisations have been closed and well-known soil scientists have retired or moved to other posts. The institutes which employed them, have in many cases, not seen fit to employ new, young soil scientists with fresh ideas to replace them. A formerly rich bank of experience in soils and agriculture of many parts of the world, has gradually been reduced almost to the point where it is in danger of extinction. Research administration, with limited funding, and deafened by the clamour of more strident branches of learning - that it really does fit the popular conception of being \"just dirt\". However it is considered, (as just dirt, or a complex organo-mineral association capable of sustaining all of the biological ecosystems on earth) soil is the means whereby human beings are provided with 99 per cent of their food as well as materials for clothing and shelter. In my estimation, the soil does seem to be grossly undervalued. It is after all a fundamental part of the whole natural environment within which we live and have our being. At the same time, the way in which science as a whole is being approached is undergoing change. Traditionally, research has been the activity of an individual, attached to a University or Research Institute. The means of financing these individualistic activities have become increasingly difficult to obtain, and in many branches of science too expensive to continue in this manner. Governmental attitudes to science also have changed; with economic recession there has been less inclination to see tax-payers money spent on the crazy hunches of scientists which administrators see as having no clear aims or guaranteed return on the money invested. The present trend is that research should be undertaken by teams, whose work is described as purposeful and which is aimed at specific goals with immediate benefits. Although the amount of money spent on soil research, compared with the science budget as a whole is minute, serious questions have been asked about the relevance of what has been done and how effectively the results of completed research have been applied and what also should be done in the future. Regrettably, the work done by soil scientists has not caught the imagination of the population at large and so the soil science community has rightly been asked why this should be so. As a result, in March 1992, a meeting took place at Rennes in France to assess the situation, to examine the way forward and to attempt to rectify matters. ",
        "This meeting was supported by the European Community under its programme on Life Sciences and Technologies for Developing Countries. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss a prepared document entitled Pedological Research for Developing Countries : attempting a holistic approach (Anon, 1992). At the conclusion of their discussions the soil scientists who met at Rennes issued their findings in a booklet New Challenges for Soil Research in Developing Countries : a holistic approach (Anon, 1992), a copy of which you all have been given. My talk this morning, which attempts to summarise these discussions, is based upon these two documents. Points discussed at Rennes The Rennes meeting thought it necessary to pay close attention to the following points which are given on page 6 of the booklet : 1. The need to make the most of scientific knowledge and indigenous empirical know- how and skills. 2. The need to assess priorities for research, where it should be done and for whom. 3. The urgent need to obtain sound and significant results. 4. The need for continuity in soil research in both developed and developing countries. 5. The need for soil research to reveal how best to achieve an efficient and sustainable use of the land. 6. The need to Involve local partners in soil research. 7. The desirability of using an holistic approach. A major consideration of the Rennes meeting was that soil is more than just a natural part of the biosphere; it is a much more complex entity with political, social, economic, financial and legal implications. It is not possible to take soil out of its natural context, study it, research into its problems and give land-users advice, all in a complete vacuum. These feelings resulted in the proposal to adopt an holistic approach for future studies in pedology and soil science as a whole. Another consideration which was discussed in Rennes was the urgency with which soil research is carried out and implemented. Complaints were made that soil science in many tropical countries was concerned with \"fire-fighting\" - trying to provide immediate solutions for problems - and this results in decisions which are based on inadequate research. Inevitably, experts from the \"developed\" countries saw solutions in terms of their own experience and not necessarily in terms of the conditions locally prevailing. In future it was considered necessary to incorporate the experience and knowledge of local people, and their attempts to solve pedological problems, into the research programmes of the future. An attempt should be made to provide some assessment of the priorities for soil research, soil management, soil vulnerability and the sustained use of soil, and indeed, the development of a national soil policy for every country. One of the cornerstones of STD policy is to go into partnership with Developing Countries to strengthen the research capabilities of nations such as those in the SADDAC group and to assist them in the development of sustainable policies for soil use and management. This would, of course, include investigating agricultural systems and their impact on soils; the aim being to encourage sustainable agriculture with low external ",
        "inputs and to maintain productivity without degrading the soil and depleting the environment. Where land can no longer support people, It should be investigated why, and how that land could be made productive again on a continuing basis. The stimulus for research should come from the local beneficiaries, and not always from visiting \"experts\". Research should be provided with adequate facilities and there should be quality control exercised over the research being pursued. Efficient use of the limited resources available should be made with the use of cost-benefit analysis to ensure value for money. There is little point in carrying out soil research unless the results of that research are published and used for the benefit of the farmers and other people who use the soil. Perhaps we have learnt the lesson that, although some esoteric branches of research are often of great scientific interest and provide great satisfaction to the researcher, they may be of limited practical application. Where research has produced information of practical use, it should be presented in terms which are user-friendly, especially to administrators, politicians and policy-makers. After all, these are the people who control the purse-strings and to whom we should present a clear case for a fuller understanding of the role of soil in the environment and consequently the need for continuing research in soil science. Some problems which require attention After an examination of two problem areas where research contributions from soil scientists have been valuable (in NW Tunisia and in peri-urban areas of towns in developing countries), the Rennes participants compiled the following list of problems which they considered required attention. 1. City expansion on to prime agricultural land. 2. Implementation of land use policies and appropriate strategies for designing and managing the urban and peri-urban landscape. 3. Use of soil as a building material. 4. Land use and stormwater management; mass movement, soil erosion and water management. 5. Air water pollution and soil contamination as a result of intensive agricultural and horticultural land use in peri-urban areas with respect to their effects on urban life, its infrastructure and buildings; air pollution, especially urban dusts and land use. 6. Conflicts between recreationalists, farmers and natural resource managers. Those who met at Rennes were of the opinion that all these problems deserved attention by soil scientists and that in every case they required a systematic treatment which was wider than traditional investigations in soil science. This confirmed their inclination towards an holistic approach. Priorities The Rennes meeting identified research priorities at two levels : in the highly mechanised systems of agriculture and in the simpler indigenous systems. From the Tunisian example, it was noted that there was a need to retain an overview of land use in the whole ",
        "watershed area when problems are being studied, not just the particular site under consideration. Participants were aware of the considerable impact soil research could have on problems of erosion, soil and water conservation, salinization, changes in organic matter content and its behaviour, soil fertility status and the estimation of the health risks where soil contamination has occurred. These are some areas where soil science can make a significant impact and at the same time are branches of soil study which are urgently needed in many parts of the World as the recently produced World Map of the Status of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) (Oldeman et al., 1989) has shown. It is obvious that the practical work can only take place in the countries where the problems are being experienced. The fact that the EC has gathered us together in this meeting is positive proof that there is goodwill and a desire from the European end to assist with this process. However, on this occasion we have come to listen and not to lecture you on what to do. In our discussions we hope that an exchange of experiences will result in the identification of what this group has called benchmark soils for the SADDAC countries. It is necessary to understand the present situation before proceeding to further studies. The data required to underpin such studies can be retained and recalled rapidly using data handling systems such as SOTER, developed by ISRIC for the ISSS, UNEP, and FAO. A national scheme is currently operating in Kenya and a broader, sub-continental scheme will cover soil conditions in South America when it is completed. Conclusions In this presentation, I have tried to stress that it is not simply problems with the soil itself that have to be solved, and so research strictly within the realm of soil science will not solve them. For these reasons, the Rennes meeting strongly recommended that an holistic approach be adopted in future studies. The exercise does not end there, however, as it is necessary to identify certain soils as worthy of study either because of the problems which are experienced in using them, or because they are widespread, fertile soils upon which it is desirable to increase agricultural productivity on a sustainable basis. The strong possibility exists that certain sites could be candidates for inclusion in the recently announced GTOS scheme (Heal, et al. 1992) for world monitoring for environmental problems, so we must bear in mind that we are dealing with benchmark sites which may have local, regional or even world significance. This is the background to our meeting here in Harare as I see it and I am sure my colleagues, some of whom participated in the Rennes meeting, would be prepared to confirm and amplify my sometimes speculative account of their discussions.

        "AN APPLICATION OF THE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SOIL RESEARCH ON THE MEDIUM ALTITUDE PLAIN IN MALAWI. S.A. Materechera and G. Prasad Introduction The medium altitude plain of Malawi has an undulating landscape at about 1000 m above sea level with flat to gentle slopes. The rainfall is 750-1000 mm per annum. The major soils are red, deep and developed from highly weathered granite and gneiss. The valley floors are infilled with alluvial deposits. The natural vegetation, which still covers approximately one third of the area, consists of Brachystegia woodland (miombo). The soils are fertile and are intensively cultivated in a traditional system, mostly for maize, sometimes intercropped with legumes. On the alluvial soils in the valley bottoms where water is available, vegetables are grown and grazing takes place all the year round. Land tenure is customarily held by the male head of household and he manages the land helped occasionally by hired labour. When he is absent for paid employment, he instructs his wife how to manage the field and provides the inputs. Women cultivate gardens around the house and manage small fields in the valleys where vegetables are grown. The proceeds from the gardens and the small fields are the women's income. In times of stress, all the family is the source of support and every member assists for the common good. The problems Traditionally, fallow periods of three to four years were practised. With increased population, land holdings have decreased in size and the fallow periods become restricted or disappeared altogether. Also, farmers are moving on to marginal lands with steep slopes unsuited to crop production. As more fuelwood is collected, the forests become thinner. These practices have led to a decline in soil fertility, breakdown of soil structure and nutrient loss with consequent lower infiltration rates, higher surface run-off and soil erosion on slopes. Yields have also declined. Stocking rates of cattle have increased, leading to overgrazing in the valley bottoms resulting in a decline of edible grass species and other vegetation, decreasing biodiversity. Investigations are needed Into the following problems : - Plant nutrient replacement and regeneration of soil structure using traditional land management systems. - Indigenous soil and water conservation techniques with emphasis on cropping systems. - The land tenure system. - Marketing system for the small-scale farmers. - Alternative use of land; selecting crops as raw material for manufacturing and processing. - Farmers's education. ",
        "Conclusions Before any ambitious schemes are embarked upon, it is necessary to list priorities for research in terms of both topics and areas. There should be a collection of information about current problems in scientific publications and indigenous knowledge systems. Establishing research teams which include farmers and extension workers as participants to study the problems from the farmer's point of view would be most desirable. A methodology to teach and translate the findings of research results to farmers should be evolved. Finally, a feedback mechanism from farmer to extension worker and including the Ministry of Agriculture should be instituted. 2. GULLY EROSION IN THE MIDDLEVELD OF SWAZILAND H. Mushala and G. Stoops Introduction Swaziland may be subdivided into four physiographic regions, namely the Highveld, Middleveld, Lowveld and the Lubombo Plateau. The Highveld consists of the higher and wetter escarpment edges and mountain ranges to the north, and hilly and plateau-like mountains in the south. The Middleveld and Lubombo regions have rolling topography with an altitude of about 600 metres. The Lowveld is sandwiched between the eastern Lubombo range and the western Middleveld ranges. It is the hottest and driest of the regions. The Middleveld is very significant in the livelihood of most Swazis because it supports the highest number of people in the country and has the highest stocking rates. Therefore there is considerable pressure on the available land resources. As a result, soil erosion is a very serious problem, especially on communal grazing areas of the Swazi Nation Land (SNL) where gully erosion is very spectacular. Rainfall is unimodal, with most of it occurring in summer between the months of October and April. Land use practices in the area include mixed agricultural production in which grazing is combined with crop production. The cultivated plots average 2 ha in area, but in some cases they are smaller. The problems The problems associated with gully erosion include the physical removal of the soil and exposure of subsoils including palaeosols; the deterioration of soil productivity through nutrient loss; gully encroachment and disruption of cropland; sedimentation of rivers and reservoirs (e.g. Mnjoli dam) especially in the Lowveld; and the hydrologicai fluctuation in rivers regimes caused by increased surface run-off and limited infiltration. ",
        "The potential risks include reduced soil productivity requiring increased investment in agricultural inputs by farmers; the severity of drought impact is increased; and ultimately the land is unworkable. Rehabilitation of land with gulleys is rather difficult and expensive to achieve. Attempts to control soil erosion in the past have included the establishment of grass strips on cultivated plots to control the impact of sheet erosion. The grass strips were introduced in the country in the 1950's following King Sobhuza ll's directive. For sometime the grass strips have been successful but they are growing much thinner than the prescribed widths thus being less effective. On rangelands, controlled grazing slowed rates of gully encroachment but increased population pressure and overgrazing have exacerbated the situation. The increase in population has resulted in the increased use of chemical fertilizers on cultivated areas, the use of organic manure and the adoption of various water harvesting techniques. Such has been the reaction of the farmers to cope with demands for food production and the unreliability of rainfall. Erosion The problem of gully erosion can be linked to land tenure arrangements in the country. The SNL is communally grazed with most of the pastoralists considering themselves as users of the land rather than owners. SNL is controlled by local chiefs on behalf of the King, who holds the land in trust for the Swazi Nation. The chiefs allocate land for agriculture (crop production) to a married male for use by his family. The allocated plots are usually small and there are limited possibilities of employing suitable soil conservation strategies. Although there is awareness of the erosion problem, the farmers have little room for manoeuvre. Under such conditions the SNL falls prey to the \"tragedy of the commons\" syndrome. Swazi national lands do not compare favourably with private farms which are held under Title Deeds, where controlled grazing is practised and other soil conservation strategies are put into use, and agricultural production is market-oriented. The issue of \"user-owner\" and \"user-only\" comes to the fore and may contribute to the attitudes developed by the land users. Data availability There is documentation related to gully erosion research in the country, although some of the documents are relatively old (e.g. Murdoch's soil map). There are various government reports, and other research reports, including some journal articles published in neighbouring countries (e.g. South Africa). However, most of the studies were not systematic and adopt different methodologies. In essence, a real database, in the form of a GIS, is non-existent. Given the situation, there is need to establish standardized methods of monitoring and evaluation. For example, the SARCUSS (Southern African Regional Commission for the ",
        "Conservation and Utilization of Soil) system has been in use for a long time for erosion classification and could be used as a standard. There is need to have other data on socio-economics, livestock statistics, vegetation, meteorology, hydrology and indigenous land and water management systems to augment soil research data. In these overgrazed areas, for example, it is difficult to obtain correct livestock statistics because the people are usually suspicious of government intentions for their livestock. An important consideration relates to the dissemination of research results. Most of the government reports, conference papers, research journal articles and books are directed at the scientific community. For the most part the land users, who are affected by the erosion problem, do not get the benefit of research findings. The situation could be alleviated by making the research results available through the agricultural extension service in such a manner that they can be transmitted to the land users. Alternatively, or additionally, there is need to hold workshops or seminars with the traditional leaders (chiefs) to create an awareness among them and to establish the means of dissemination of information to the farmers. Conclusions It is our opinion that applied research can have a beneficial impact on the human environment if people are made aware of the usefulness of the results; results are relevant to their problems; and that the results are within the means of implementation of the land users (i.e. acceptable, cost-effective/economically viable). Research results can have an impact on the physical environment if they can be used to control the physical processes e.g. reduce rate of soil removal, or increase water infiltration (thus reducing surface run-off), increase soil organic matter or increase sedimentation of gully floors by use of check dams. In any case there is need for sociological studies to compliment soil research with the purpose of enhancing acceptance of the results. It is assumed also that with an explicit or implicit economic benefit acceptance will be more readily achieved. In this regard some of the anticipated strategies could have partial financial support from government or a foreign agency. It is also important that the traditional leadership is made aware of the usefulness of the results of research in order to enhance acceptance. In all these cases there are political implications on land use adjustments, which may involve influencing the chiefs in the process of allocating land to the farmers on behalf of the King. In this way, the land allocation procedures and process can be beneficial to the whole community. ",
        "3. A CASE STUDY OF AREAS OF MARGINAL RAINFALL IN THE SADC REGION S. Muchena and G. Ferrari Introduction All SADC countries have areas of marginal rainfall where the precipitation amounts to less than 600mm and is erratic in occurrence, mid-season droughts being quite common. Most of Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Swaziland, Lesotho, Angola and Mozambique and smaller portions of Zambia and Malawi experience these conditions. In Zimbabwe, for example, 78% of the country has a rainfall which is marginal for crop production. Most of the communal lands are located in this area. They have in common that : - The people are mostly poor, living on small farms with a mixture of enterprises. - Soils are of low fertility and degraded. The lack of financial resources, and insecurity of food supplies, often accompanied by endemic diseases such as malaria, is experienced widely. In addition, desertification and deforestation occur and siltation of river beds is common. Agricultural productivity is generally low. This is because of shortages or even lack of inputs stemming from a poorly developed infrastructure, lack of credit and lack of merchants to handle the inputs and outputs from the agricultural industry. When the inputs are available they are generally quite expensive. Research Orientation Research facilities and agricultural extension services are often missing. The holistic approach guidelines were followed in compiling the following observations. It was felt there was a considerable amount of existing documentation and information available, often detailed local information. This information is to be found at offices of the Sector Co-ordinators for Food Security, Land Management and Environment SACCAR, the National Agricultural Research and Extension Services, Universities, and International Development Agencies including NGOs. There is both a potential risk and an actual occurrence of land degradation. Soil erosion and deforestation have already reached unacceptable levels. Lessons in agricultural sustainability from the past exist for both livestock and crop production. Particular note was made of those holistic efforts involving livestock production, agro-forestry, strip cultivation and soil and water conservation. The panel felt that the sustainability of these efforts would depend in part upon the nutritional standards of the food produced and the economic benefits to the farmer. Therefore information ",
        "on markets and agribusiness is vital in planning the components of a holistic system that depends on the introduction of greater diversity. The holistic approach therefore requires a combination of soil information with other relevant data. Use of an holistic approach 1. The reasons were discussed why the holistic approach has not been demonstrated to the farmers in their own fields and why the policy makers have not yet been convinced of the benefits which would accrue. A bottom-up approach is needed to ensure the message of soil conservation is reaching the farmers. 2. It was felt that success would breed more success and lead to the achievement of the real goal i.e. an improved quality of life for the farming communities. The knowledge and experience gathered by soil scientists must become incorporated into the traditions and culture of the people. 3. The need to monitor soil conditions and evaluate soil fertility, as well as crop productivity, farmers incomes and other indicators of soil degradation was noted. The farmers could be trained to monitor their own situation. Finally some form of assistance was necessary to start the process but this should be reduced once sufficient momentum has been gathered. The SADC governments should be encouraged to provide adequate support for the National Agricultural Research Organisations and Extension Services and to ensure the stability of those institutions. 4. THE TANZANIAN HIGHLANDS : PROBLEMS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AREA K. Haule and E. Sousa Introduction The panel adopted an holistic approach, beginning with an analysis of the physical nature of the environment. It is a Highland area, with an average altitude of 1000-1 500 metres above sea level. The physiography is rolling with steep to very steeply sloping landforms. Annual rainfall is 1000-1 500mm with a monomodal or unimodal seasonal distribution. The geology consists of basement complex dominated by gneissic rocks which form the most widespread parent material for soils. The major soils present in the Tanzanian Highlands are Acrisols, Lixisols and Ferralsols with subsidiary areas of Luvisols and Cambisols. Smallholders dominate the agriculture and farming systems include : - mixed crops or inter-cropping systems e.g. maize, beans, coffee, etc. ",
        "- mono-cropping systems such as maize coffee, beans, etc. - mixed farming (crops with livestock including cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and poultry). Major constraints The major constraints for agriculture in the region are concerned with the soil and the moisture availability. The soil constraints, which may be physical, chemical or biological, include :- a. Soil acidity, with low calcium and magnesium contents and aluminium toxicity. b. Low fertility; soil nutrients status is poor including low nitrogen and phosphorus levels. c. Low water-holding capacity of the soils, particularly with the Ferralsols and Acrisols. d. Soils are vulnerable to erosion, especially on sloping land. The water or moisture constraints include : a. Water loss mainly through run-off from sloping lands. b. Water or moisture loss and/or stress resulting from low or erratic distribution of rainfall during the growing season(s) and decreasing rainfall amounts. c. Moisture stress caused by the occurrence of long droughts and poor or low water holding capacity of soils. d. Decline in rainfall caused by deforestation for different purposes e.g. cultivation, timber harvesting for construction, fuel, etc. Research needs The panel identified the following gaps in the present state of knowledge : a. Insufficient detailed information and analysis of soil resources; special attention should be paid to moisture characteristics and nutrient levels. b. Insufficient detailed analysis of rainfall data with special emphasis on the pattern of rainfall distribution during the growing season (s) - preferably on period or weekly basis for a better understanding of the occurrence, length and frequency of dry spells. c. Limited or insufficient information about soil and water management and conservation studies. There is a lack of detailed information and analysis of the soil conditions and water resources, especially rainfall amounts. Recommended remedial measures a. To create an awareness and appreciation of the problem(s) amongst the farmers, if necessary through demonstrations of appropriate technology. b. To encourage the participation or involvement of the farmer(s) in technological demonstrations as well as relevant on-farm research. c. To study and properly define the existing agricultural systems with the aim of improving existing farm practices. d. To develop and experiment upon new or improved, sustainable agricultural systems based on the research results from studies of soils, water, crops and livestock. ",
        "e. To disseminate research findings and to deliver to the farmers in an acceptable, user- friendly manner. f. Dissemination of research recommendations should be carried out through agricultural extension personnel and other related disciplines including policy makers. Conclusions When considering the similarity of areas of highlands throughout the SADC region and other areas of Africa, it is to be expected that research findings can be extrapolated with confidence where similar physical and environmental conditions occur. Proper adaptation may be necessary according to local social circumstances. It will be necessary to improve the capabilities of the farmers by providing credit facilities, and improved availability of the necessary inputs of fertilizers, seed etc. At the same time it will be necessary to develop outlets for surplus (or extra) production and to create markets and transport systems in particular. The whole agricultural community would benefit from the increased farm productivity, and it is desirable that this should be accompanied by social education of the farmers to help them adjust to the rapidly changing conditions. 5. THE BOTSWANA HARDVELD : A CASE STUDY USING AN HOLISTIC APPROACH B. Moganane and M. Walsh Introduction Botswana lies between latitudes 18\u00b0S and 25\u00b0S and longitudes 20\u00b0E and 29\u00b0E. The country can be divided into four major distinct physiographic units namely, hardveld, sandveld, lacustrine and the alluvial areas. This case study using the holistic approach will be confined to the hardveld. The Hardveld The Hardveld may be described as a plateau formed by an extensive erosional surface, mostly developed on Precambrian rocks, which occurs in the eastern part of Botswana. It is a fiat to gently undulating plain situated at about 1000 m above sea level. Acid igneous granitic and gneissic rocks are extensive with occasional outcrops of basic rocks such as basalts and dolerites. This physiographic unit is also characterized by active contemporary erosion with some depositional areas related to old and recent river beds. The average annual precipitation on the Hardveld ranges from 450 mm to 550 mm. However, the rainfall is very erratic and tends to fall in high intensity, short duration events. The vegetation of the Hardveld is an open savanna of both microphylus and ",
        "broadleaved species, thus there is not much vegetative cover protecting the soils from the torrential rains of the thunderstorms which are a common feature of the rainy season. The population of Botswana is 1.3 million (1991 population census), of whom approximately one million live on the Hardveld. This shows that, although the land surface of Botswana (582 OOO km 2 ) is large, there is a concentration of population on the hardveld. The landuse in the hardveld is varied. Both pastoral and arable agriculture are practiced by the farmers. There are many major villages and towns as well as the capital city, Gaborone, which also provides various commercial and industrial activities for the inhabitants. A network of other infrastructural facilities like rail, road, telecommunication are present on the hardveld. An Holistic Approach to the Hardveld Following the guidelines given in the proceedings of the Rennes Workshop, 1992 on New Challenges for Soil Research in Developing Countries, A Holistic Approach, an effort was made to identify problems of the hardveld of Botswana, particularly with regards to soils and agriculture. The salient points of an holistic approach involve identification of the problem within the environmental and social conditions in which it is to be found. Awareness and Importance of Documentation Extension agents are fairly well informed, but farmers are still poorly informed because 1. Extension agents are not very happy with the raw soils data which is available. They prefer to deal with land evaluation data, but this is incomplete. It lags behind because it is necessary to process the soils data provided by the research scientist into a readily useable format, and this takes time. 2. Potential risks will always remain, because even with simple explanations, farmers need to have sufficient management skills and should have resources to practice and maintain soil conservation techniques. The potential risks are nature of soils, high Intensity, short duration rainfall which leads to splash erosion, excessive runoff and gully erosion. These problems are made worse by deforestation to increase the area of farmland, fuelwood collection, overstocking and overgrazing. A further potential risk is that rural-urban migration particularly of younger people, will lead to insufficient labour for agriculture and to maintain conservation structures. 3. There is still much to be achieved in terms of scientific understanding of the soil, its management and qualities. There is need to strengthen linkage between research and extension, so diat knowledge is effectively shared and put into operation. ",
        "4. Soil productivity should be sustained or improved so that there is no longer any reason for migration to the towns, but as the population continues to increase, so there are made greater demands on the land, leading to chemical and physical deterioration of the soil. 5. Manpower for soil inventorization remains indispensable, otherwise there will not be a basis against which future consistent and reliable data may be compared. Improved facilities to compare soil and land information are needed. 6. Land evaluation should be multidisciplinary and as comprehensive as possible to achieve the successful use of land. Nowadays many farmers are commercially minded and can deal with banks which need figures. 7. Dissemination of research results is very essential. Strong linkages are necessary between researchers and extension workers. 8. There is need to assess the impact and acceptance of research in Soil Science on the human and physical environment. Where there is a lack of labour, new agronomic innovations should be considered instead of labour-intensive construction works, e.g. making bunds. The capacity for implementation of conservation programmes should be thoroughly assessed. 9. Accuracy of methods for monitoring the human and physical environment is indispensable to safeguard against the dangers of soil degradation and conservation failures. 10. It is vitally necessary that there is an acceptance of any proposed solution by the community. Any programme proposed has to be financially attractive and socially acceptable for farmers, so socio-economic studies should be carried out before any solution is put into action. Key points 1. Need to strengthen research and extension linkages. 2. Rural-urban migration caused by the current unattractive nature of agriculture, particularly for the younger generation, resulting in a lack of farm labour availability. 3. Low and erratic rainfall.

        "6. THE NORTHERN PROVINCE OF ZAMBIA A CASE STUDY A.M. Bunyolo and H.B. Madsen Introduction The Northern Province of Zambia lies in the high rainfall zone where the annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 1 500 mm. The rains start in October/November and end in March/April. The general elevation of the zone is from 1200 to 1500 meters above sea level. The predominant vegetation is the Miombo woodland which is characterized by Brachystegia, lulbernadia and Isoberlinia species. Dambos or wetlands are a common feature in the region. Soils The most extensive soils are Ultisols and Oxisols which are strongly weathered and leached. Thus, the soils are very poor in fertility and are generally very acid with a pH of 4.5 or lower. Most of the soils also have a high aluminium and iron oxide content which increases the capacity for phosphorus fixation. In some soils, aluminium content is sufficient for the soils to be toxic to plant growth. In general, the physical properties of the soils are favourable. They are deep and well- drained because they possess good aggregation properties. The only limitation in terms of physical properties is the low water holding capacity of the dominant soils. Farming systems Farmers in the Northern Province have developed unique technologies to address soil infertility and acidity. The most famous systems are the Olitemene (lopping of trees and burning) and the Fundikila (mound system). These systems control or remove the serious soil constraints in the short-term (one to five years). The crops grown are finger millet, cassava, beans and groundnuts. These are usually grown in sequence until the land is abandoned through decline in fertility and weed infestation. Shifting cultivation is thus the major farming practice in most of the Northern Province. Shifting cultivation has many disadvantages including serious loss of plant nutrients, soil compaction and physical and biological soil deterioration as a result of burning. There is a need therefore to develop alternative farming systems for improved land productivity and sustainability. From current and past research the following recommendations may be applicable : 1. Fertilizer and lime application. Here the farmers are constrained by lack of resources. 2. Incorporation of organic manures (farm yard and green manure) to improve soil fertility and structure. The main factors to consider here are availability and ",
        "acceptability. Not all farmers keep livestock and farmers may not wish to grow green manures if they do not see direct economic benefits. 3. Agro-forestry, especially the growing of N-fixing trees together with crops has shown some great potential. The feasible solutions to address soil infertility problems could be summarised as follows 1. Organic manure introductions to improve soil fertility. 2. Introduction of livestock (in areas which are free of Tse-Tse fly) which could provide manure. 3. Agro-forestry research to increase N and organic matter content. 4. Fertilizer and liming (in judicious amounts because of economic constraints). For all the solutions previously described there is a need to intensify socio-economic studies, impact assessment studies and studies of adoption rates to ensure that the technologies developed are suitable for the farmers conditions. Holistic approach for evaluation of alternative land use systems Instead of simply describing the present land use system the team evaluated the alternative systems according to the recommended framework : 1. Land Use at specific locality The proposals (alternative systems) must ensure ecological sustainability through improved production, improved physical, chemical and biological soil properties and preservation of the environment as deforestation will be mitigated. 2. Land User Household The proposals will result in more permanent use of the land. The increase in productivity will create surplus for sale for import of fertilizer and other economic activities. The changed scenario might have some influence on the socio-cultural sustainability though data for prediction are not available. 3. Community and Agrarian Society The social structure might change because of money economy. Sociologists and economists to be consulted. 4. Technical watersheds The agriculture will become more intensified which can change the hydrology of the area (less water supply and leaching of nutrients). The biodiversity might change also through less natural vegetation as a result of intensified agriculture and also changes in the land use pattern. Other scientists e.g. hydrologists and biologists should be contacted for their expertise. 5. Administrative Region/District Need further explanation. Contributions from other experts required. ",
        "6. Country and State The economy of Zambia is currently very weak. The economy is completely liberalized through the SAP which might have serious implications for the land use systems. For instance farmers will move away from systems which require purchase of inputs. Environmental research is lacking and this must be initiated. 7. CASE STUDY IN MOZAMBIQUE M. Benzane and S. Sakellariades The problems The people's need for land, is pushing the forest and bushland boundary to higher elevations in order to obtain land for cultivation. Also, people cut trees to obtain timber for constructional purposes and domestic energy. Overgrazing pastures results in an increase of the run-off and soil erosion. The shift of agricultural activities to greater elevations and steeper slopes increases the soil erosion problem. All these human activities, cause a deterioration in the soil chemical properties by increasing the rate of oxidation of the soil organic matter and the leaching of plant nutrients. The net result is a decrease of soil fertility to a very low level. Forested areas are being cut, and after deforestation, the unprotected soil is eroded at an increased rate, depending upon the land use. Lowland soils and coastal areas receive water and soil material eroded from the upland areas and they also may be affected by sea water intrusion. The net result is flooding and/or salinization of the lowland soils. On the other hand, lowlands are used for intensive agriculture where irrigation water is applied, adding further amounts of salt form the irrigation water. Background to the problems In order to overcome these problems we have to consider the constraints which affect the sustainability of agriculture in the study area. We can organize them as physical, chemical, biological and socio-economic. Because climate is an important physical factor, with uncertainty and unreliability of rain, the meteorological data of the area and probable change of climate are important considerations. The chemical problem of salinity in lowland soils must be considered and a better water management system introduced to accommodate all kinds of water use. Biological constraints include the need to improve the health and productivity of farm animals and crops. ",
        "Socio-economic problems include situations of bad land tenure systems, low income, lack of and poor marketing opportunities, low land inputs and unorganized rural infrastructure, the absence of extension services and lack of appropriate technologies. Overcoming the problems For the development of sustainable agriculture systems in the study area the following must be considered. 1. A recognition and organization of the existing knowledge. 2. Integration of crop and animal production systems with components of agro-fores try and pasture development. Plant nutrient cycling to reduce the need for fertilizers. 3. Cropping systems using, where possible, indigenous plants. 4. Integrated watershed conservation to protect the soil from erosion. 5. Reliable mechanization technologies and integrated water management. A multidisciplinary approach to protect coastal soils from sea water incursion into the groundwater. 6. Any measures taken must be acceptable to the community. 7. Sustainable methods must be applied to prevent soil degradation, and where necessary administrative and governmental measures must be taken in order to reconstruct degraded soil. 8. Rehabilitation of the land by reforestation and/or conservation needs the approval and acceptance of the local people, and research in order to establish the right methods for any particular place must also be acceptable to the local community. Conclusion From the potential point of view, it seems that Mozambique has sufficient land for the everyday needs of the population. However, risks of land degradation jeopardize this situation and with the resulting loss of land it would be insufficient. Highland is subjected to erosion and lowland is subjected to salinization and drought. Any decrease in the rainfall received would lead to desertification. 8. CASE STUDY : MEDIUM RAINFALL AREA OF ZAMBIA N. Mukanda and W. Moll Introduction The case study chosen for discussion lies in agro-ecological zone II of Zambia. It is a plateau area with an average elevation of 1,200 m above sea level. It has a medium rainfall of between 800 and 1000mm, sometimes with heavy storms. The soils are dominantly Acrisols, with Lixisols; clayey topsoils over clay subsoils are one type and an abrupt textural change (SL over SCL/SC) comprise a second type. The general problem experienced is land degradation ",
        "Specific Problems These may be the product of any one environmental, physical, or socio-economic situation or all in combination. 1. Soil fertility decline. 2. Overgrazing - less grass, poor animal health, soil compaction, run-off. 3. Deforestation - lack of fuelwood, catchment destruction, high run-off and less seepage into the soil to replenish soil moisture reserves. 4. Expensive inputs to maintain production combined with unattractive returns. 5. Labour shortages. 6. Soil erosion resulting in the silting of dams, rivers, dambos, and less water stored foi- productive use. 7. A general malnutrition for active people; lack of household food security with a hunger period from November to April. 8. High population densities. 9. Continuous cultivation of the same piece of land. Farming Systems Common in the area maize monocropping. maize rotation with sunflower, soyabeans and groundnuts. maize intercropped with groundnuts. cattle rearing - communal grazing lands. Tillage methods Use of hoes - growing on the flat and/or on ridges. Use of ox-drawn implements. Specific Land Use System not sustainable Degradation of physical, chemical and biotic parameters. If no cure for degradation, could system be restored. Soil and vegetation productivity have declined. Land User Household Socio/cultural systems are not sustainable but merely surviving. System not economically profitable. Farming system is mixed. Whole systems are based on a survival strategy - i.e soil mining in order to survive. Farm structure : individual farming plots, but communal grazing (average farm size 2 - 4 ha.). ",
        "Community and Agrarian Society Social structure is based on the relationship Chief - Headman - Family. Chief has powers over land allocation. Family members inherit from their parents - patrimonial sons inherit from fathers, nephews inherit from uncles. Gender division - some tasks and crops are gender specific -eg. looking after cattle is a man's work; groundnut growing is women's work, etc. Land tenure : land is communally owned but powers to allocate land to farmers are vested in the chief. Country/State The central and local government is strong with good programmes, but the economy is weak and therefore the government cannot implement the plans. There are no subsidies - because economy is liberalised and the government policy is to pursue a market economy. Small scale farmers in villages and on communal lands hold no title deeds for properties, therefore are not obliged to invest in conservation measures in case they are moved by the chief. Agricultural systems are dependent on external forces - eg. producer pricing, fixing of prices for inputs, transport, etc. However, agricultural institutions are well established with extension and research services, but no money to implement projects. Environmental research is incomplete and is biased towards physical parameters with insufficient consideration of socio-economic factors. 9. TANZANIA : A CASE STUDY A.]. Chayo-Ngowi and J.H. Kauffman Introduction The Highlands Area of Kilimanjaro Region is situated in the north-eastern part of Tanzania Mainland (Tanganyika). The Region has both highlands with elevation varying from slightly less than 1200 m to over 2000 m, and lowlands of <600m above sea level. The highlands of the region lie on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro (Kibo and Mawenzi Peaks) and on the Para range of the south-eastern Part of the Region. A Environmental Variability The rainfall is quite reliable - sometimes high with the eastern side getting both orographic rain and quite intensive convective rain storms. In I year out of 10 many parts experience drought. Temperatures are equable, ranging from I 8 - 30\u00b0C. ",
        "The Soils vary appreciably. 1. Those from the slopes of Mountain Kilimanjaro are derived from volcanic ash (basic) and theoretically are expected to be more productive. 2. Those derived from basement (granitic) complex rocks - on the slopes of the Para Mountain range are less productive soils. \u0392 Social Variability 1. On the volcanic soils the population density is quite high. Cultivation in these areas is now encroaching on the very steep slopes and this is causing accelerated soil erosion. 2. The basement complex area has a relatively low population density, but still higher than many other parts of Tanzania. 3. Crops : Coffee intercropping with banana and a variety of yams are grown on volcanic soils; coffee, banana, cotton, maize and beans are preferred crops on the soils of the basement complex. Problems A The soils are very fragile - they have been farmed intensively for many years without proper management. 1. Erosion is a pronounced problem, especially on the very steep slopes. This is because of the high rainfall and poor physical soil conditions resulting from the reduction of soil organic matter content. 2. Low fertility is caused by exhaustive cultivation on the volcanic soils and inherent low fertility in the soils farmed from basement complex rocks. 3. Very shallow soils, especially on the very steep slopes of the basement rocks, induce moisture stress in years of low rainfall. Landslides occur frequently during seasons of very intense storms. 4. Farmers need inorganic fertilizers because farmyard manure is not sufficient. Presently, 50 to 60 per cent of farmers can afford Inorganic fertilizers. 5. Land preparation is mainly done manually with animal traction occasionally used. A shortage of manpower, especially in the near future is going to cause tremendous problems. \u0392 The problems of erosion and low fertility in the region are now very serious and require urgent attention. C The Highlands of Kilimanjaro are representative of large areas inside and outside Tanzania (Volcanic highlands also exist in the Southern Highlands, also in some districts in Iriga and Mbeya). The soils which are developed from basement complex rocks on high mountains also are extensive in the Usambara ranges of the Tanga Region, and in the Uluguru and Kaguru mountains in the Morogoro Region. ",
        "D Local research Institutions - Experimental Stations a) Lyamungo -originally developed by the Coffee Board. b) Tanga National Soil Service (NSS). c) Uyole agriculture centre in Mbeya. d) Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) and Ilonga Research Station in Morogoro. E Economic importance : These are major production areas for cash crops. Research is needed to solve the following The following research needs were formulated during the panel meeting, however these should be seen only as a first attempt because the involvement of the farmers in the definition of the research programmes is required. 1. How to prevent loss of nutrients by high rainfall - fertilizer experiments are required. 2. How to prevent loss of nutrients through soil erosion - application of soil conservation techniques. 3. Prevention of acidity by liming. 4. Population pressure; proper family planning and movement of people to lower density areas. There will be the need to study how to best to develop these areas. 5. Need to translate technical information into easily understandable messages for farmers by soil scientists and extension staff. 6. Need for fertilizer experiments at the farmers level. 7. Need for social studies to implement family planning programmes. 8. Need for economic market studies and crop diversification. 9. Need for anti-erosion measures including both soil and social studies. Steep forested lands are being encroached upon by farmers. There is a need for a balance to be struck between people's needs and the conservation of natural resources. Conclusions 1. Applications of fertilizers are presently often not economic or viable because of unrealistic low prices for agricultural commodities (eg maize prices are kept low by governments and the very low world market prices for coffee, tea and sugar etc.). 2. If present local knowledge of soils (name or classification) should be correlated with scientific soil classification. 3. An INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH to research by the local institution is presently inadequate. 4. Inadequate finances to support research institutions - including lack of mobility. 5. Training exists but farmer level should also be included. 6. Conflict arises for researchers because devoting their time to research and trials at an on-the-farm level is not of interest for scientific journals. ",
        "10. IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE BENCHMARK SITE IN MALAWI G.K.C. Nyirenda and P. Brabant Introduction Malawi is a small country of about 120,000 km 2 , and about one third of this is composed of water. The physical features of the country comprise of the following regions a) Lowlands occupy about 20% of the country (37-600m). b) Mid-altitude Highlands occupy about 50% (650- 1300m). c) High altitude lands 30% (1 300-3050m). The rainfall, like the topography, is variable in distribution and amount. It ranges from about 600mm to 2000mm/year depending on the area. The Shire valley The Shire valley has been chosen as a potential study site. This valley lies between 37 and 600m above sea level in the great East African Rift Valley system along the eastern flank of the country. Calcimorphic soils are most prevalent in the valley. Slopes rise steeply on the sides of the valley to surrounding highlands. These are a number of problems with regard to the productivity of the soils. The major ones of these being soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Erosion by water is in the form of sheet, gulley and sometimes flash floods. Causes of Erosion Although there are some aspects which are only partly understood, there is no doubt that the main activities which play a critical role in soil erosion are : (a) deforestation, both during land clearing for agricultural activities, clearing of land for settlements or dwellings and along paths used for fetching fuelwood for energy in the homes. In addition to the active clearing of forests, bush fires play an important role in deforestation. (b) Overstocking : Many farmers keep too many livestock (cattle and goats) so that overgrazing is quite common and this leads to soil erosion. In some parts, erosion caused by overstocking and overgrazing is very serious. (c) Land pressure is very serious in some areas with population density reaching 250 persons/km 2 . This does not allow for any shifting cultivation or fallowing of the land. As a result of this pressure on the land, cultivation is extended onto very steep slopes where erosion is very serious, leaving the slopes bare of soil. ",
        "Natural Vegetation This is mostly open woodland of the miombo type on the valley slopes. Much of this has been cleared, giving way to cultivated lands. Grasslands occur on the valley floors. There are a number of dambos which are of variable size. The major dambos include the Shire valley itself, which is the flood plain of the Shire river. There is much agricultural activity in main valley, on the dambos, and on the rift valley slopes. (a) On the slopes and valley : The crops grown include the main annual crops of maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes, pearl millet, cassava and a limited amount of pigeon pea. Perennial crops grown include coffee, bananas, mangoes, citrus fruits and the other fruits. (b) In dambos, rice is grown in winter and summer, vegetables are grown in winter. Dambos are also used by livestock for pasture both in the cold and dry seasons. Factors which limit an increase in production (sustainable land use). 1 . There is a limited use of soil conservation measures by smallholder farmers to keep erosion in check. Deforestation and bush fires are common. Although many farmers build ridges, few build terraces. With the consultation and agreement of the smallholder farmers efforts should be made to introduce soil conservation measures such as re afforestation, avoidance of bush fires, building of terraces and ridges, planting of v\u00e9tiver grass and also adoption of agro-forestry practices. 2. Use of organic manure, although desirable it is limited by the shortage of livestock. However, an increase in livestock numbers would lead to overgrazing and hence soil erosion. 3. Farmers might increase soil fertility by the use of chemical fertilizers, even if this would means the amount of fertilizers used are below the optimum levels. The high cost of fertilizers is the main stumbling block. Moreover, in some situations fertilizers are not available at the right time, even if the farmers had the necessary financial resources to purchase them. 4. It is also felt that farmers may not understand what is expected of them, and that it is not adequately explained to farmers what to do. Many farmers therefore, fail to appreciate actions which are said to be done on the their behalf. There is a need to educate and Involve farmers, who should be brought into discussions right at the inception of any conservation project or programme. Finally, the utilization of the Shire valley and the dambos to increase food production in the rainy season could benefit by flood and drainage control, and in the dry season by the introduction of irrigation.

        "11. GULLY EROSION IN LESOTHO M. Williams and J. Porta Introduction The lowlands of Lesotho constitute one third of the country and lie at an altitude of 1 500 - 1800m above sea level. The soils are developed from basaltic parent materials as well as sandstone and shale which underlies the basalt. These soils are highly erodible on moderately steep to steep slopes where they are under intensive cultivation. Climate in this region is semi-arid, with minimum average annual temperature of 5 - 10\u00b0C in winter and maximum of 15 - 22\u00b0C in summer. The higher temperatures are experienced during rainy season which occurs between September and November. Gullies are the spectacular and readily observable evidence of the accelerated soil erosion which occurs in Lesotho. The economic loss to the country is undoubtedly quite large. It is estimated that 4 per cent of arable land is lost to gullies annually and 1000 ha are lost through extension or widening of gullies. Soil erosion in Lesotho is accelerated through over-stocking, over-population, over-cultivation, poor management methods and road construction. Holistic Approach Utilizing the holistic approach, the following features of the agriculture and soils of Lesotho were thought to be significant. In the first place, the perception of erosion as a problem was not unknown to farmers but the use by the local farmers of conservation methods is limited because of social and economic constraints, le^ lack of ownership, too large scale and costly methods. Using an inter-disciplinary approach to the problem, the following subjects should be involved in the analysis : Erosion : Soil Science and Geomorphology. Watershed Management : Hydrology and Forestry. Land tenure systems : Law and Sociology. Extension Services : Agronomy, local need assessment. Economic Constraints to farm income : Economics. Concern was expressed about the lack of approach to human needs in conservation of natural resources. A consideration of this involved investigations into : ",
        "Production-oriented methods. Economic Profitability. Soil conservation. Water conservation. Range Management. Afforestation. In an holistic approach, stress has been laid upon the usefulness of research into soil use and management, and that it is essential to maintain the quality of research and to introduce a farmer's demand research, geared to the needs of small scale farmers and to pass on to the farmers the results in readily comprehensible language. In this context : Funds for research must be maintained. Results of research must be transferred. Effectiveness of the extension service should be improved. Training opportunities must be provided. Extension service personnel must be involved in research projects. Village Development Committees must be involved in identifying the needs for research on methods suitable for farmers' multi-faceted activities. Other aspects which could simply and effectively make an improvement in the standard of living of the local community include water-harvesting in the fields, roof-water harvesting, gravity-fed irrigation systems. Horticulture should be encouraged for small scale farmers. 12. THE HIGHVELD OF ZIMBABWE H.R. Kamwendo and E.M. Bridges Introduction The Zimbabwe highveld is a plateau situated at an altitude of 1000 to 1200 m above sea level. In attempting an holistic approach to the certain problems of soils and land management on the Highveld, the salient environmental features can be summarised as follows : 1. It is located on the watershed between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers in the central part of Zimbabwe. 2. The landscape is gently undulating to nearly fiat plain, but this plain is interrupted by numerous granitic tors (kopjes) on the low rises. The valleys are shallow saucer-shaped depressions, locally known as dambos, which remain moist for much of the year. 3. The temperature regime does not restrict plant growth which is possible all year round. However, the rainfall (750 mm) is unimodal with most rain falling in the warmer period of the year. ",
        "4. The underlying rocks are predominantly granitic, but there are scattered outcrops of base-rich mafic materials. 5. The soils are mainly light to medium loams and are strongly leached. They are generally well drained, especially on the upper slopes, but on the lower slopes and particularly in the dambos soils are poorly drained. The study site The site(s) envisaged for study are the densely populated communal areas. In these areas the land use is very intensive with maize, groundnuts and pulses grown for foodcrops. Tobacco and cotton are grown as cash crops. Much cultivation is done with hand tools and animal power is frequently used; mechanical power is not often available for the farmers. The Problems Resulting from the high density of population which is dependent upon the land, the physical resources of these areas are very heavily utilized to the extent that environmental degradation is evident. The features of this are : 1. There is a shortage of land for the increasing population. 2. Land is required for cultivation, so trees are cleared. Trees are also cut for use In buildings and for fuelwood resulting in deforestation. 3. Intensive cultivation without adequate attention to soil conservation measures results in soil erosion. 4. Water resources are affected as run-off is rapid with little infiltration, so wells are drying-up as the water table is getting lower. Rivers are becoming silted with the soil eroded from the fields. Research needs There is a need to collect comprehensive data on both the physical, human and socio economic environment in order to deal with the problems of sustainable use of the natural resources of these communal lands. The problems of environmental degradation, declining fertility and declining productivity, must be tackled urgently. Conclusions Many problems of the small farmers on the community lands result from a vicious cycle of increased population pressure on a limited area of land, increased demand for agricultural produce, more intensive use of the land inducing declining fertility and falling farm incomes. There is then insufficient return for the farmers to purchase lime and fertilizers to improve yields. An holistic approach readily identifies that problems of soil and land use cannot be solved without recourse to data and information from related branches of study, especially in the social sciences.

        "PART II (Section 5) FUTURE ACTIVITIES A concluding exercise undertaken by the workshop was to discuss topics for the guidance of further research activity in the SADC region. A similar \"brainstorming\" activity as was employed in the main part of the meeting produced eighteen phrases which delegates thought were of critical significance. When asked to place these topics in order of merit/importance, delegates gave strong support to a continuation of \"benchmark\" soils investigation and regional information centres and workshops. The development of regional research networks was also seen as being a helpful way to proceed. The full list of the topics considered, together with the number of votes they received follows : 1. Benchmark soils and applications (12) 2. Regional meetings and workshops (9) 3. Regional information centres (9) 4. Research network (8) 5. Case studies (4) 6. Newsletter (4) 7. Searching for funding for common activity (3) 8. Dissemination of research results (2) 9. Agreements between universities (2) 10. Develop relationship between SACCAR and Europe (2) 1 1. Inventory of research results (2) I 2. Steering committee for soil research ( 1 ) I 3. Exchange of students ( 1 ) 14. Soil information system (1) I 5. Post-graduate programme ( 1 ) 16. Development of extension workers education ( 1 ) 17. National meetings (0) 18. Publications (0) Thus the meeting confirmed the importance they had identified earlier in developing a good working knowledge for sustainable use of the soils in the SADC region. The delegates recognised the need for a regional information centre and for associated meetings and workshops at which the results of research activities could be disseminated. A \"newsletter\" was not given strong support, nor were exchanges of students or postgraduate programmes seen as being effective. In view of the direction of some discussions during the workshop, it was surprising that delegates did not give a higher priority to the development of extension workers education. This is not to say that delegates thought it did not matter; they considered other aspects had a higher priority. ",

        "European Commission EUR 1 5808 - A Holistic approach to sustainable soil use in SADC countries (Proceedings) Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities 1994 - xxv pp. 3 fig. , 2 tab. - 14,8 \u03c7 21 cm The Life Sciences and Technology for Developing Countries (STD3) research program\u00ad me of the European Union has promoted a fresh \"holistic\" approach to research in soil sciences within the concept of \"sustainable development\". In developing further this approach in a practical answer and a real-life situation, STD3 organized a \"brainstor\u00ad ming\" workshop in November 1993, hosted by the Soil Science Department of the University of Zimbabwe. This publication contains the scientific contributions presented at the workshop as well as the interim and final discussion papers prepared by the delegates during the \"brainstorming\" sessions. African delegates to this workshop came from a majority of Southern African coun\u00ad tries. They were asked to identify problems associated with soils that they came across in their own work. Then from their experience and in discussion with European delegates, they were asked to develop a comprehensive problem-solving approach. The workshop concluded that the problems of soils are not isolated phenomena but are integral parts of an intricate web of interactions between human beings and the natural environment, the areas described as case studies in this publication identify areas in the SADC countries of Southern Africa that are at high risk of irreversible environmental degradation and where special intervention is urgently needed to arrest the decline of natural resources. The identification of \"benchmark soil sites\" where good or bad management effects can be monitored is as important as the recognition of the central role of certain soil types in ecosystem characterization. These areas need to be monitored in their totality and management changes needed for conservation should be treated comprehensively and not just regarded as problems in need of specific soil \"therapy\". Delegates were aware that this approach is only a first step in the direction of using soil in the context of sustainable development, and they also considered the most appropri\u00ad ate means by which further research could be implemented.
