        "I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) RECOMMENDATIONS EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Belgium covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/01) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Belgium submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 31 December 2018. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Mem\u00ad ber States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subse\u00ad quent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Belgian draft national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on this assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union.

        "(5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. (7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Mem\u00ad ber States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Bel\u00ad gium ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Belgium ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and rec\u00ad ommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member St ates should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the accompanying staff working document ( 6 ).

        "(13) Belgium notified a draft national energy and climate plan accompanied by a draft federal plan, four draft regional plans and a number of additional annexes. While supplementary documents can be annexed, the final NECP needs to contain all elements required by the regulation, including all information to assess the proposed ambi\u00ad tion levels and the adequacy of the plan in achieving them, notably through a comprehensive overview of poli\u00ad cies and measures and an accompanying impact assessment. Substantial effort and political willingness are needed to achieve a better integrated national energy and climate plan, which would in turn constitute a more useful tool to facilitate cooperation between the different responsible authorities in achieving the energy transi\u00ad tion. Specific attention is needed to managing interlinkages between the decarbonisation and energy efficiency dimensions and the other dimensions, notably by presenting more concrete and quantifiable objectives related to energy security, internal market and research, innovation and competitiveness supporting the achievement of the decarbonisation, renewables and energy efficiency ambitions, and by explaining better how the energy efficiency first principle was taken into account. (14) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from presenting a comprehensive overview on competitiveness, not only of the energy-intensive industries, but also the low-carbon technology sector, pro\u00ad viding a concrete analysis on the position in the global market, highlighting areas of competitive strengths and potential challenges, and pointing at measurable objectives for the future and policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. It would also benefit from a further integra\u00ad tion of circular economy policies, emphasising their benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Belgium are underpinned by the assessment of Belgium's draft integrated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ), HEREBY RECOMMENDS BELGIUM TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Complement the information on the policies and measures needed to achieve the greenhouse gas target for sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading system of - 35 % in 2030 compared to 2005, including in the building and transport sectors where most reductions will have to happen, by providing further details on their scope, tim\u00ad ing, and the expected impacts. Specify the intended use of the flexibilities between the effort sharing, accounted land use, land use change and forestry and the emissions trading system sectors. 2. Significantly raise the level of ambition for 2030 to at least 25 % as Belgium's contribution to the Union's 2030 target for renewable energy, as indicated by the formula in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Include an indicative trajectory in the final integrated national energy and climate plan that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in accordance with that share, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts for reaching this target collectively. Indicate detailed and quantified policies and mea\u00ad sures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Furthermore, ensure that Belgium's renewable energy target for 2020 set in Annex I of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ) is fully met and maintained as a baseline from 2021 onwards, and explain how Belgium intends to meet and maintain such baseline share. Step up efforts in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and intensify efforts to increase and diversify renewables in the transport sector. Provide additional detail on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, including simplifica\u00ad tion of administrative procedures. 3. Increase the energy efficiency ambition by reducing final energy consumption, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. Support this with policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Underpin proposed policies and measures by an impact assess\u00ad ment and a more detailed set of information on the scale and implementation timeline in the period 2021-2030. ( 7 ) SWD(2019) 211.

The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (8) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Bulgaria ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Bulgaria ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester.

The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (12) The integrated energy and climate plans provide the opportunity to coherently define long-term policies and measures, taking into account resulting interlinkages between dimensions in terms of potential synergies or risks. While the policies and measures described in the draft plan seem to consider some interlinkages, their assess\u00ad ment across the five dimensions should be further reinforced in the final plan. The analysis could include quanti\u00ad tative estimates and should also cover possible negative interactions between policies and measures and show how Bulgaria intends to address them. In particular, the synergies between the decarbonisation, energy security and the internal market dimensions and the energy efficiency first principle warrants further assessment. Simi\u00ad larly, the role of energy efficiency in addressing energy poverty should be further looked at. An important element to be further assessed in the final plan, including from the costs and competitiveness angles, is the inter\u00ad action between the planned continuation of coal based power generation and enhanced use of gas with the decarbonisation dimension. Another element is the impact of biomass use on the accounted removals in the land use and forestry sector. The link between electricity production and the deployment of low-carbon technologies should be further addressed under the research innovation and competitiveness dimension. (13) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from a comprehensive analysis on where the low-carbon technologies sector, including for decarbonising energy- and carbon-intensive industrial sectors, is currently positioned in the global market. The plan would benefit from highlighting areas of competitive advan\u00ad tage and potential challenges, and defining objectives, policies and measures based on them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. Interactions with the circular economy and its relevance for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, in particular, could be further emphasised. ( 4 ) SWD(2019) 1001 final/2.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Czechia covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/03) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Czechia submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 31 January 2019. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Czech draft national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assess\u00ad ment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on this assessment. In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectiv\u00ad ity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objectives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and measures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (4) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (5) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. (6) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty.

        "(7) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (8) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Czechia ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Czechia ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (9) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (10) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (11) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (12) The interlinkages between the Energy Union dimensions are visible in the draft plan, but not explicitly men\u00ad tioned. In the final plan, Czechia should expand on the mentioned interlinkages between the different Energy Union dimensions by identifying synergies within the decarbonisation dimension, e.g. biofuels and land use, land use change and forestry. Synergies between decarbonisation, energy security and internal market dimensions also in relation with the energy efficiency first principle should also be further explored, by explaining how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals security of energy supply and to address energy poverty, including clear timeframes. An important element for further consideration in the final plan is the planning of a just transition in relation to coal and carbon-intensive regions. The impact of climate change risks on energy supply is another relevant consideration. Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions. (13) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from presenting a comprehensive analysis on where the low-carbon technologies sector is currently positioned in the global market, highlighting areas of com\u00ad petitive strengths and potential challenges and pointing at measurable objectives for the future and policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. It could also benefit from a better interaction with the circular economy, emphasising its greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential.

Clarify how it intends to reach its 2030 greenhouse gas target for emissions not covered by the EU emissions trad\u00ad ing system of - 39 % compared to 2005, including putting into place further cost-efficient policies in the building sector and further defining its planned transport policies, and specifying its intended use of the flexibilities between the effort sharing, land use, land use change and forestry and emissions trading system sectors. 2. Underpin the welcomed level of ambition of a 55 % renewable energy share for 2030 as Denmark's contribution to the Union 2030 target for renewable energy with detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and Council ( 8 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Clarify among others, the level of the indicative trajectory that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Furthermore, put forward trajectories and corresponding measures in the transport sector to meet the transport target pursuant to Article 25 of the Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide additional details on the specific measures to ensure sustainability for biomass supply and use in the energy sector, given the important contribution of biomass across the Danish energy mix. 3. Substantially increase its ambition towards reducing both final and primary energy consumption in 2030 in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. Propose more ambi\u00ad tious policies and measures that would compensate for the likely effects of substantially lowered funding levels for energy efficiency and for the agreed energy tax decreases, and that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Include new measures designed to, and capable of delivering the energy savings required under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU. This is particularly important in the light of Denmark's decision to discontinue its existing energy efficiency obligation scheme which would lower the funding available for final energy savings actions. Pro\u00ad vide more clarity on the actual measures capable of delivering on the ambitions as regards cleaner and more effi\u00ad cient transport and vehicles. 4. Define clear, measureable and forward-looking objectives concerning market integration. 5. Further elaborate on the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specif\u00ad ically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between now and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 6. Expand the already good regional cooperation arrangements, in particular with the other Nordic (Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) and Baltic (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) countries to other cooperation mechanisms. Possible areas for enhanced cooperation in renewable energy include planned statistical transfers or hybrid renewable projects, where offshore wind electricity is connected to more than one market. In research and innovation these include alignment of research programmes, coordinated funding, and identification of synergies with other Member States and with Union's programmes and initiatives. 7.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Germany covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/05) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Germany submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 20 December 2018. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the German draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national integrated national energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. (7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate ( 1 ) OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. ( 2 ) SWD(2019) 229. ( 3 ) Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). 3.9.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 297/17 ",
        "that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Germany ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Germany ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) Considering the overall good set-up of national targets in energy and climate policy outlined in the draft plan, the final plan could specify the main interactions between these targets both in terms of national ambition levels and in terms of provisional, planned, additional and existing policy instruments. Elaborating further on sector coupling and on the related incentive structure across different sectors of the economy would allow addressing the consistency of policies and measures within and between Energy Union dimensions more comprehensively. In that context, consideration could be given to identifying investment needs in all Energy Union dimensions, preventing sudden impacts of shifting prices by ensuring a gradual phase out of energy subsidies with long term visibility and to measures mitigating the impact on vulnerable consumers through energy poverty measures. A comprehensive impact assessment could help addressing policy interactions, e.g. by quantifying the impact on accounted emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry of a sustainable supply of biomass for energy purposes, including risks for energy security due to climate change. A quantitative overview in the final plan of the development of different sources of flexibility required to integrate the rising share of renewable energy in the electricity system could help to address additional interactions between Energy Union dimensions. Information on how the energy efficiency first principle is taken into account in national policies and measures across various Energy Union dimensions could be included more comprehensively.

        "(14) An additional element deserving increased attention is industry competitiveness and the areas of Germany's com\u00ad petitive strengths and potential challenges in its energy transition. Measurable objectives for the future would be beneficial, together with policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise, industrial and education policy. The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from a better interac\u00ad tion with the circular economy, emphasising its greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Germany are underpinned by the assessment of Germany's draft inte\u00ad grated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ). HEREBY RECOMMENDS GERMANY TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Specify cost-efficient additional policies and measures, notably in the building, transport and agriculture sectors, to address the significant projected gap to its greenhouse gas target for sectors not covered by the EU emissions trad\u00ad ing system for 2030 of -38 % compared to 2005. 2. Provide detailed and quantified policies and measures; in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and Council ( 8 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of the German contribution of 30 % renewable energy share to the Union's renewable energy target for 2030. Put forward trajectories and provide specific measures to meet the transport target pursuant to Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide additional details on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, including simplification of administrative procedures. 3. Provide a sufficiently ambitious national contribution for both primary and final energy consumption, which takes into account the need to increase, collectively, the level of efforts necessary to reach the Union's 2030 target, and to support the national contribution with policies and measures at a scale adequate to deliver the corresponding energy savings. Clearly identify policies which are planned to be adopted and implemented in the period from 2021 to 2030, their expected impacts as well as their timeline for implementation and budgetary requirements. 4. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility, as well as information on phase-out from nuclear. 5. Define forward-looking objectives and targets concerning market integration, in particular measures to reinforce market signals and to improve the effective impact of market components in the electricity price. Include a timetable with appropriate measures to remove structural congestion in the electricity system and to provide efficient dispatch and locational signals to the market as an important element of the final integrated national energy and climate plan, notably as a basis for further cooperation and coordination with other Member States and in view of the functioning of the internal energy market. 6. Further clarify national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between 2022 and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 7. Continue, both in the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plan and during its implementation, regional cooperation in respective high-level groups and consultation of neighbouring Member States. In that con\u00ad text, focus on the coal and lignite phase-out, renewables deployment and the internal energy market, addressing issues such as interconnection levels and capacity from 2021 onwards, regional cooperation measures related to assessing system adequacy, just transition and energy system changes required for accommodating higher shares of renewables that are expected to modify cross-border electricity trade while enhancing the need for system flexibility.

The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Estonia ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Estonia ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and rec\u00ad ommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester.

The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final plan Estonia should take into account interlinkages between the planned policies and measures, notably, by considering the implications of the energy efficiency first principle on the decarbonisation, energy security and internal energy market dimensions. The contribution of energy efficiency to reducing energy import dependency and offsetting the impact of the reduction of electricity generation from oil shale are important elements in this regard, also with a view to integrating increasing shares of renewables and ensuring future elec\u00ad tricity system generation adequacy. The impact of climate change risks on energy supply is another relevant con\u00ad sideration. Estonia should pay particular attention to specifying the implementation status and impacts of policies and measures, as well as providing greenhouse gas projections split by policy sector (emission trading system, effort sharing sectors and land use, land use and forestry). Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

Provide additional details on measures to meet the indicative target in the heating and cooling sector pursuant to Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and ensure that adequate measures are in place for the increase of renewables to meet the transport target set out in the draft plan and in line with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide additional details on the specific measures planned to ensure the long-term sustainability of the use of biomass in the energy sector, given the important contribution of biomass across the Estonian energy mix. Provide measures on the enabling frameworks for renew\u00ad able self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 including simplification of administrative procedures. 3. Increase the level of ambition towards decreasing both final and primary energy consumption in 2030 in view of the need to increase the level of efforts necessary to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. Support it with policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. In the final plan include all the policies and measures planned to achieve the cumulative savings goal with a realistic schedule of implementation and a clear assessment of their investment needs. 4. Specify measures to ensure the electricity generation adequacy in light of the ambitious renewables target, including measures on demand response and storage. 5. Define forward-looking objectives and targets concerning market integration, in particular measures to develop more competitive retail markets and to increase the level of consumer engagement in the retail market. 6. Further clarify the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between now and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate Plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 7. Intensify the already good regional cooperation arrangements between Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania); extend them to new areas and broaden the geographic reach to include the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The focus of the regional exchanges should be on internal energy market and energy security areas, in view to the changes in the electricity systems accommodating higher shares of renewable electricity, which will increase electricity import/export and enhance the need for system flexibility, as well as on the decarbonisa\u00ad tion of the transport sector and research.

(4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its integrated national energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Ireland ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Ireland ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final plan, Ireland should build on the draft plan's considerations of policy interactions by elaborating on the synergies between the decarbonisation, energy security and internal energy market dimensions. One such issue is the impact of the planned coal phase-out and increasing levels of renewable energy on energy security and electricity system generation adequacy. Another issue to elaborate is the compatibility of the planned increase in biomass use with the plan to increase removals from land use, land use change and forestry. The consideration of the energy efficiency first principle in setting criteria for renewables support eligibility and in proposing policies in the energy security and internal energy market dimensions is another important element to be addressed in the final plan. Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

Put forward, as Ireland's contribution to the Union's 2030 target for renewable energy, a share of renewable energy of at least 31 % as indicated by the formula in Annex II under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Include an indicative trajectory in the final integrated national energy and climate plan that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in accordance with that share, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts for reaching this target collectively. Put forward detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and Council ( 8 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Ensure that the renewable energy target for 2020 set in Annex I of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ) is fully met and maintained as a baseline from 2021 onwards, and explain how it intends to meet and maintain such baseline share. Put forward trajectories and corresponding measures in the heating and cooling sector and the transport sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and the transport target in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Put in place measures to overcome administrative burden and detailed information on measures on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 3. Substantially increase its energy efficiency ambition by lowering the level of both final and primary energy consump\u00ad tion in absolute terms in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. Support this with policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Express the final contribution as a specific value for both primary and final energy consumption. Detail the underlying methodology to estimate energy savings. An indication of required investments to implement energy efficiency policies is also needed. 4. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy dependency in particular in the gas and oil sector in light of uncertainties related to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. 5. Further elaborate on the national objectives and funding targets research, innovation and competitiveness, specifi\u00ad cally related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between now and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the its integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 6. Build on the framework of the North Seas Energy Cooperation and the Clean Energy for EU Islands Initiative in order to deliver on the renewables target and ensure timely implementation of ongoing interconnection projects.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Greece covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/08) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Greece submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 25 January 2019. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Greek draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its integrated national energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Greece ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Greece ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons.

The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final plan Greece should build on the positive interlinkages between planned policies and measures pointed out in the draft plan, and further explore the more challenging policy interlinkages. One such interlink\u00ad age is the synergies within the decarbonisation dimension, e.g. the impact accounted emissions and removals in the land use, land use change and forestry sector of planned bioenergy policies. Another interlinkage is the syn\u00ad ergies between the decarbonisation, energy security and internal market dimensions with the energy efficiency first principle, e.g. by explaining how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy and security of energy supply. Energy efficiency could also be con\u00ad sidered with regards to the alleviation of energy poverty. The objectives under the research, innovation and com\u00ad petitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "(14) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from also covering the low-carbon technolo\u00ad gies sector, including measures for decarbonising energy- and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and a more comprehensive analysis on where this sector is currently positioned in the global market, highlighting areas of competitive strengths and potential challenges. It could also benefit from further elaboration on the greenhouse gas emissions savings stemming from actions related to the circular economy. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Greece are underpinned by the assessment of Greece's draft integrated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ). HEREBY RECOMMENDS GREECE TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of Greece's 31 % contribution to the EU 2030 target for renewable energy, by including in the final plan, among others, an indicative trajectory that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and provide detailed and quantified policies and mea\u00ad sures complying with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Reconcile the objectives put forward in the draft plan for the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector with the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and the transport sector in line with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 2. Substantially increase its ambition towards reducing both final and primary energy consumption in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target and support these with policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Clarify the timeline for the adoption and implementation of the policies foreseen to be in place as of 2020, especially for the new instruments. The measures foreseen to achieve the cumulative savings goal should be designed at an adequate scale. 3. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility, in particular regarding natural gas. Include an assessment of how the infrastructure projects and regional cooperation contribute to the energy security objectives, also making use of regional cooperation and flexibilities to use the opportunities presented by reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the modernisation of the Greek economy. 4. Include forward-looking objectives and targets concerning market integration, in particular measures to increase com\u00ad petition in the retail and wholesale markets, in line with its commitment under the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme of reducing, by 2020, the incumbent's retail and wholesale market shares below 50 %. Implement the electricity target model and market coupling with neighbours, based on the timelines agreed under the post-pro\u00ad gramme surveillance mechanism. 5. Further quantify the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between now and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 6. Intensify the already good regional cooperation arrangements with Bulgaria and Cyprus as well as with the Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC) countries. In the context of the \u2018Clean Energy for EU Islands\u2019 initiative, enhance cooperation with Member States and island regions facing similar geographic, climatic and infrastructure related challenges and opportunities in their energy transition. Explore the cross-border potential and the macro-regional aspects of a coordinated energy and climate policy notably in the Adriatic-Ionian with the aim of reducing the region's carbon footprint and implementing an ecosystem approach. The focus of the regional exchanges could be on internal energy market and energy security areas, in view to the changes in the electricity systems accommodating higher shares of renewable electricity, which will increase electricity import and export and enhance the need for system flexibility. In addition, make use of bilateral cooperation and flexibilities to use the opportunities presented by reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the modernisation of the Greek economy.

The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Mem\u00ad ber States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Spain ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Spain ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommenda\u00ad tions in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommenda\u00ad tions are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester.

The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) There is a broad coherence of the objectives within and between the dimensions, in particular on decarbonisa\u00ad tion and energy efficiency. In the final plan, Spain should also describe the interlinkages between planned policies and measures and further quantify these where possible. A focus could be the synergies between the decarbonisation, the energy security and internal market dimensions with the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and its link to addressing energy poverty. The interactions of the planned policies related to the phase out of coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants, including the strategy for the use of nuclear fuel cycle facilities existing in the country, the impact of climate change risks on energy supply, and the impact of the increased penetration of renewable energy on the internal market are also important elements to be addressed in the final plan. The objectives under the research, innovation and competi\u00ad tiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of France covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/10) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) France submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 15 February 2019. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the French draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. ( 1 ) OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. ( 2 ) SWD(2019) 263. C 297/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.9.2019 ",
        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for France ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to France ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final plan France should take into account the interactions between dimensions. As an example, measures to improve energy efficiency or increase the deployment of electric vehicles will reinforce security of supply by reducing the needs for imports of oil and gas. The draft integrated national energy and climate plan acknowl\u00ad edges that energy efficiency is the first principle guiding the efforts towards the energy transition. Some negative interactions between policies and measures in one dimension and objectives in another dimension are included. A thorough analysis of peak load developments in the period from 2021 to 2030 is required, as well as a precise assessment of energy security and interconnection, and to set objectives accordingly. The objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions. The final plan could include more information on how climate change risks might affect energy supply.

The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Croatia ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Croatia ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester.

These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final plan the coherence between the different dimensions should be taken into account. For example, Croatia's plans to strengthen energy security by exploring the possibility to increase the production of domestic hydrocarbon resources should be considered against the attainment of objectives related to the decarbonisation dimension and the energy efficiency first principle. The objectives under the research, innovation and competi\u00ad tiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions. Other examples are the impact of increased bioenergy use on the accounted emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry and of climate change risks on energy security.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Italy covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/12) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Italy submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 8 January 2019. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Italian draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its integrated national energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. ( 1 ) OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. ( 2 ) SWD(2019) 264. C 297/44 EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.9.2019 ",
        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The integrated national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure invest\u00ad ment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Mem\u00ad ber States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Italy ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Italy ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommenda\u00ad tions in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommenda\u00ad tions are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In its final integrated national energy and climate plan Italy should build on the positive interlinkages between planned policies and measures pointed out in its draft integrated national energy and climate plan, and further explore the more challenging policy interlinkages, notably between the decarbonisation, energy security and internal market dimensions. More details are expected notably: (i) on the consequences of the phase out of coal- fired power plants and expected evolution of the role of gas in the energy mix; (ii) on how to achieve the high penetration of renewables; (iii) on the impacts of the Italian Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM) in terms of prices for energy consumers; (iv) on expected evolution of fossil fuels subsidies. Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "(14) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from highlighting areas of competitive advantage and potential challenges at global level for the low-carbon technologies sector, including for decarbon\u00ad ising energy- and carbon-intensive industrial sectors. Measurable objectives for the future defined on that basis would be beneficial, together with policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. The final integrated national energy and climate plan could also benefit from further elabo\u00ad ration on the greenhouse gas emissions savings stemming from actions related to the circular economy. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Italy are underpinned by the assessment of Italy's draft integrated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ), HEREBY RECOMMENDS ITALY TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Underpin the welcomed level of ambition of Italy's 30 % renewable energy share for 2030 as contribution to the Union's 2030 target for renewable energy by detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations requested in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Increase the level of ambition of renewables in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Put forward measures to meet the transport target in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Reduce the complexity and regulatory uncertainty and provide additional details on the enabling frameworks for renewable self- consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 2. As regards energy efficiency, ensure that the key policy instruments illustrated in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan would still deliver adequate savings in the period 2021-2030. Adequately reflect the envis\u00ad aged updates and improvements to existing support schemes in the final integrated national energy and climate plan and in the following progress reports. Scale them up significantly to allow for the achievement of the indicated energy savings goals. Given the significant untapped potential, continue to work on strengthening energy efficiency measures for buildings (for new and existing public and private buildings) and in transport. 3. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility. Take into account the regional context and the actual potential of the interconnectors and of the generation capacities in the neighbouring countries when assessing resource adequacy in the electricity sector. Clarify to what extent the development expected in the gas sector is compatible with the stated decarbonisation goals and the envisaged phase-out of coal-fired thermoelectric plants. 4. Set clear objectives, milestones and timelines to deliver on the envisaged reforms in the energy markets, notably in the wholesale natural gas markets and in the operation of both the electricity and natural gas retail markets. 5. Clarify the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between 2021 and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 6. Carry out consultations with neighbouring Countries and within the Central and South-Eastern Europe Gas Connectivity (CESEC) High-Level Group in view of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Explore further the cross-border potential and the macro-regional aspects of a coordinated energy and climate policy, notably in the Adriatic with the aim of reducing the region's carbon footprint and implementing an ecosys\u00ad tem approach and further harness the potential of deeper Mediterranean cooperation. 7. List actions undertaken and plans to phase-out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels. 8. Complement the analysis of the interactions with air quality and air emissions policy, including from a quantitative perspective. ( 7 ) SWD(2019) 264.

These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) While the policies and measures described in the draft plan seem largely coherent across dimensions, Cyprus should further develop its assessment of interlinkages between policies and measures in the final plan. Cyprus should also provide more information on the synergies between the decarbonisation, energy security and internal market dimensions as well as the energy efficiency first principle. The analysis could include quantitative esti\u00ad mates and should also cover possible negative interactions between policies and measures and how Cyprus intends to address those. An assessment of policy interactions and cross-cutting impacts could also be useful for single policies and measures or groups of policies and measures with a wide-ranging impact on Cyprus' energy system and beyond. This includes policies related to the full implementation of a competitive electricity market, the introduction of natural gas, or the interconnection of Cyprus' isolated electricity system. The objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Mem\u00ad ber States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Latvia ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Latvia ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and rec\u00ad ommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final integrated national energy and climate plan Latvia should take into account the policy interlinkages, notably the synergies between the decarbonisation, energy security and internal market dimensions with the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining how energy efficiency contributes to 1) the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, 2) security of energy supply and 3) energy poverty. Another interlinkage to address is the use of biomass for energy purposes and the impact on accounted emis\u00ad sions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry. Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions. The impacts of climate change on the energy sector could also be addressed.

The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Lithuania submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 17 December 2018. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Mem\u00ad ber States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subse\u00ad quent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Lithuanian draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national integrated energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria.

The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Luxembourg submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 18 February 2019. The submis\u00ad sion of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Luxembourgish draft inte\u00ad grated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommenda\u00ad tions are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its integrated national energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Luxembourg ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Luxembourg ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commis\u00ad sion's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) There is a need for the final plan to provide a clear description of the additional policies and measures envisaged, accompanied by an impact assessment as well as an assessment of interactions between the different Energy Union dimensions, largely missing in the draft plan. The final plan would benefit from being more forward look\u00ad ing, taking into account the specific challenges from Luxembourg, notably due to its strong dependence on energy supply from neighbouring countries. It would also merit a specific attention to development of national flexibility measures, such as demand side response and storage.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Hungary covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/17) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Hungary submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 31 January 2019. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Hungarian draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its integrated national energy and climate plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. ( 1 ) OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. ( 2 ) SWD(2019) 267. C 297/64 EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.9.2019 ",
        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Hungary ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Hungary ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) While some policy interactions are already reflected in the plan at the level of objectives, Hungary should further develop its assessment of interlinkages between policies and measures in the final plan and describe how it intends to address them. In particular, Hungary should further elaborate on the synergies between decarbonisa\u00ad tion, the energy security and internal market dimensions with the energy efficiency first principle by explaining how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy. The interactions between renewables electricity generation and the promotion of electromobility and grid development are elements to be further developed in the final plan. Similarly, the link between the foreseen increase of biomass use in heating and cooling sector and accounted emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry, as well as sustainability requirements should be further detailed in the final plan. Lastly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "(14) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from presenting a comprehensive analysis on where the low-carbon technologies sector is currently positioned in the global market, highlighting areas of com\u00ad petitive strengths and potential challenges and pointing at measurable objectives for the future and policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. It could also benefit from a better interaction with the circular economy, emphasising its greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Hungary are underpinned by the assessment of Hungary's draft inte\u00ad grated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ). HEREBY RECOMMENDS HUNGARY TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Increase the level of ambition for 2030 to a renewable energy share of at least 23 % as Hungary's contribution to the Union's 2030 target for renewable energy, as indicated by the formula in Annex II under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Include an indicative trajectory in the final integrated national energy and climate plan that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in accordance with that share, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts for reaching this target collectively. Put forward detailed and quanti\u00ad fied policies and measures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the Euro\u00ad pean Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Increase the level of ambition in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and put forward measures to meet the transport target set in its plan and in line with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide additional details on the specific measures to ensure sustainability for biomass supply and use in the energy sector, given the important contribution of biomass across the Hungarian energy mix, especially in heating and cooling. Put in place measures to overcome administrative burden and mea\u00ad sures on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 2. Substantially increase the ambition towards reducing both final and primary energy consumption in 2030 in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. Propose more ambi\u00ad tious policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. In the final plan, make a clear distinction between the existing and additional policies and measures and provide a more comprehensive impact assessment of the planned initiatives and better estimate of the expected energy savings. 3. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility, and the strategy to ensure the long-term supply of nuclear materials and fuel, in particular in the perspective of the enlargement of its nuclear generation capacity. 4. Further detail forward-looking objectives and targets concerning market integration and put forward adequate poli\u00ad cies and measures to achieve them. In addition, allow network operators to recover all their justified and efficiently incurred costs and give network operators access to effective legal review of regulatory decisions. Outline the strat\u00ad egy and timeline for progressing towards fully market based prices. 5. Further quantify the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between now and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 6. Continue the consultation of neighbouring Member States and regional cooperation within the Central and South- Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC) High Level Group and in the context of the Visegrad Group involving Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The focus of regional exchanges could be on further integration in the internal energy market, decarbonisation and renewables deployment as well as research, innovation and competi\u00ad tiveness taking into account common challenges and shared objectives. This includes assessing system adequacy, just transition issues and energy system changes required for accommodating higher shares of renewables and other foreseen developments, which could impact electricity interconnections and trading in the region.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of the Netherlands covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/19) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) The Netherlands submitted their draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 20 December 2018. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Dutch draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. ( 1 ) OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. ( 2 ) SWD(2019) 227. C 297/72 EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.9.2019 ",
        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Mem\u00ad ber States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for the Netherlands ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to the Netherlands ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester find\u00ad ings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Com\u00ad mission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) The draft plan is based mainly on existing policy of the Netherlands, notably the 2017 Coalition Agreement and the 2013 Energy Agreement (Energieakkoord). Several elements should be added across the Energy Union dimensions, related both to the level of ambition proposed and the accompanying policies and measures, as well as the associated impact assessment. Specific attention is needed on managing interlinkages between the decar\u00ad bonisation and energy efficiency dimensions and the other dimensions, notably by presenting more concrete and quantifiable objectives related to energy security, internal market and research, innovation and competitiveness, and how these will support the achievement of the decarbonisation, renewables and energy efficiency ambitions. It should be better explained how the energy efficiency first principle was taken into account. Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Poland covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/21) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) Poland submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 9 January 2019. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the Polish draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommendations are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Mem\u00ad ber States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Poland ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Poland ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and rec\u00ad ommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) Considering the limited information on interactions between different Energy Union dimensions outlined in the draft plan, the final plan could specify key interactions between these dimensions both in terms of national ambition levels and in terms of provisional, planned, additional and existing policy instruments. The final plan could address more specifically interactions between the decarbonisation, energy efficiency and energy security dimensions. This could be supported by extending the provided comprehensive impact assessment e.g. to quan\u00ad tify the impacts on accounted emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry of a sustain\u00ad able supply of biomass for energy purposes. and addressing risks for energy security due to climate change. Moreover, building on the good starting point of the provided investment needs and expenditures in electricity and energy producing sectors, the final plan could broaden this to energy demand and non-energy sectors, across all Energy Union dimensions. Similarly, the objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "(14) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from presenting a comprehensive analysis on where the low-carbon technologies sector is currently positioned in the global market, highlighting areas of com\u00ad petitive strengths and potential challenges and pointing at measurable objectives for the future and policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. It could also benefit from a better interaction with the circular economy, emphasising its greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Poland are underpinned by the assessment of Poland's draft integrated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ), HEREBY RECOMMENDS POLAND TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Provide more information on planned policies and measures to address the projected substantial gap to Poland's greenhouse gas target for sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading system for 2030 of - 7 % compared to 2005. This includes more clarity on transport measures and more details on additional measures, notably in the building, agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry sectors and the application of accounting rules as set out in the Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ). 2. Increase the level of ambition for 2030 to a renewable energy share of at least 25 % as Poland's contribution to the Union's 2030 target, as indicated by the formula in Annex II under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Include an indica\u00ad tive trajectory in the final integrated national energy and climate plan that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in accordance with that share, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts for reaching this target collectively. Put forward detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and Council ( 9 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Ensure that the renewable energy target for 2020 set out in Annex I of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 10 ) is fully met and maintained as a baseline from 2021 onwards, and explain how such a baseline share will be met and main\u00ad tained. Increase the level of ambition in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and put in place detailed measures to meet the transport target set in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, in line with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide additional details and measures on simplification of administrative procedures, on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 3. Review its contributions and identify additional policies and measures that could deliver further energy savings in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. The proposed level of ambition towards reducing the final contribution should be better justified and backed by adequate and quantified savings from polices and measures. Support policies and measures with an impact assessment and deliver more detailed information on the scale and timeframe of implementation. Further explore policies and measures in transport considering the expected increase in the sector's energy demand in the future. 4. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility of the energy system to accommodate the foreseen changes towards 2030 and beyond. 5. Define forward-looking objectives and targets concerning market integration, in particular measures to assess the impact of public service obligations, in particular gas storage and price regulation on market functioning and clarify how negative consequences will be mitigated. Outline a strategy and timeline for progressing towards fully market based prices. ( 7 ) SWD(2019) 281.

(4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Romania ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Romania ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) The final plan should further develop the assessment of interlinkages between policies and measures, and describe how Romania intends to address them. In particular the plan should describe the synergies between the decarbonisation, the energy security and internal market dimensions with the energy efficiency first principle. The interaction between the planned further use of coal and gas at the 2030 horizon and the decarbonisation objectives needs to be assessed. Similarly, an assessment of policy interactions and cross-cutting impacts should be included for policies and measures with a wide-ranging impact, such as planned new capacities built against the energy efficiency and decarbonisation dimensions, the latest regulatory measures concerning the energy mar\u00ad ket against the internal market and security of supply objectives, and the impacts of decarbonisation measures in transport and the increased use of renewables on the grid. The impact of the increased use of forest biomass in electricity and heat production on the accounted emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry should also be assessed. Moreover, objectives under the research, innovation and competitiveness dimen\u00ad sion need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Slovakia ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Slovakia ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) The final plan should identify interlinkages and ensure coherence between the different dimensions. The holistic approach, already done in the national multi-stakeholder discussions on tackling energy poverty, while taking into account internal market and energy efficiency dimensions, should be extended to all the dimensions. Climate change impacts as a risk for energy security could also be addressed. The objectives under the research, innova\u00ad tion and competitiveness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions.

        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for Sweden ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to Sweden ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in the staff working document pub\u00ad lished alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final integrated national energy and climate plan, Sweden should also take into account the policy inter\u00ad linkages, notably the synergies between the decarbonisation, energy security and internal market dimensions with the energy efficiency first principle. The interaction of the planned policies related to the planned increase of renewables in the electricity sector and the required strengthening of the electricity networks are also impor\u00ad tant elements to be addressed in the final plan. The objectives under the research, innovation and competitive\u00ad ness dimension need to underpin the efforts planned for the other Energy Union dimensions. As the use of hydro power is important, also the climate change impacts on energy security could be considered.

        "(14) In the final integrated national energy and climate plan, Sweden could build on its general objective of develop\u00ad ing technologies and services that can be commercialised by Swedish enterprises by presenting a more compre\u00ad hensive overview on the competitiveness of the low-carbon technologies sector. It could also benefit from enhanced information on the interaction with the circular economy. (15) The Commission's recommendations to Sweden are underpinned by the assessment of Sweden's draft integrated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ), HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT SWEDEN TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Develop its strategy for achieving the commitment under Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ) that land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions do not exceed removals, based on applying the underpinning accounting rules. Pay particular attention to assessing the impact of policies and measures on emissions trading system, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors. 2. Confirm the welcome level of ambition of a 65 % renewable energy share for 2030 referred to in the draft inte\u00ad grated national energy and climate plan, as Sweden's contribution to the Union's 2030 target for renewable energy pursuant to Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ) and to Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This contribution should be underpinned by detailed and quantified poli\u00ad cies and measures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 in a way that enables a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. An indicative trajectory that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 should be included. Additional information relat\u00ad ing to overcoming administrative burden should also be included, as well, as additional details on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Additional details should be provided in relation to the specific measures planned to ensure the long-term sustainability of the use of biomass in the energy sector, given the important contribution of biomass to Sweden across the energy mix. 3. Increase the level of efforts towards reducing final energy consumption in view of the need to collectively reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target, and support it with policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Additional measures and their expected impact in terms of energy savings should be devel\u00ad oped and included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. 4. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility and electricity generation adequacy in light of the ambitious renew\u00ad ables target. 5. Clarify the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between 2023 and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 6. Intensify the already good regional cooperation arrangements between Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), extending them to new areas and broadening the geographic reach to include the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The focus of the regional exchanges should be on internal energy market and energy security areas, in view to the changes in the electricity systems accommodating higher shares of renewable electricity, which will increase electricity import and export and enhance the need for system flexibility. 7. Provide a general overview of the investment needs to achieve the climate and energy objectives, and a general assessment of the sources of that investment, including appropriate financing at national and regional level.

        "COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of the United Kingdom covering the period 2021-2030 (2019/C 297/28) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each Member State is required to submit to the Commission a draft of its integrated national energy and climate plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030 in accordance with Article 3(1) and Annex I of that Regulation. The first drafts of integrated national energy and climate plans had to be submitted by 31 December 2018. (2) The United Kingdom submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 20 December 2018. The submission of this draft plan represents the basis and first step of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation. (3) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission is required to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission made a comprehensive assessment of the United Kingdom's draft integrated national energy and climate plan, taking into consideration the relevant elements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. This assessment ( 2 ) is published alongside the present recommendation. The below recommenda\u00ad tions are based on that assessment. (4) In particular, the Commission's recommendations may address (i) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions with a view to collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the Union's 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030; (ii) policies and measures relating to Member State- and Union-level objec\u00ad tives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (iii) any additional policies and mea\u00ad sures that might be required in the integrated national energy and climate plans; (iv) interactions between and consistency of existing and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (5) In developing its recommendations, the Commission considered, on the one hand, the need to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other hand, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan. (6) The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions are based on a formula set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which is based on objective criteria. ( 1 ) OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. ( 2 ) SWD(2019) 279. C 297/108 EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.9.2019 ",
        "(7) With regard to energy efficiency, the Commission's recommendations are based on the assessment of the national level of ambition put forward in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan, compared to the collective level of efforts needed to reach the Union's targets, taking into account the information provided on specific national circumstances, where relevant. The final national contributions in the area of energy efficiency should reflect the cost-effective potential for energy savings and be supported with a robust long-term building renovation strategy and measures to implement the energy savings obligation stemming from Article 7 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ). Member States should also demonstrate that they have properly taken into account the energy efficiency first principle, by explaining notably how energy efficiency contributes to the cost-effective delivery of the national goals of a competitive low-carbon economy, security of energy supply and to address energy poverty. (8) The Governance Regulation requires Member States to provide a general overview of the investment needed to achieve the objectives, targets and contributions set out in the integrated national energy and climate plan, as well as a general assessment on the sources of that investment. The national energy and climate plans should ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. (9) In parallel, as part of the 2018-2019 European Semester cycle, the Commission has put a strong focus on Member States' energy and climate related investment needs. This is reflected in the 2019 Country Report for the United Kingdom ( 4 ) and in the Commission's recommendation for a Council Recommendation to the United Kingdom ( 5 ), as part of the European Semester process. The Commission took into account the latest European Semester findings and recommendations in its assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans. The Commission's recommendations are complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. Member States should also ensure that their integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. (10) In addition, the Governance Regulation requires each Member State to take due account of any recommendations from the Commission to its draft integrated national energy and climate plan to be submitted by 31 December 2019 and, if the Member State concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, that Member State should provide and make public its reasons. (11) Where applicable, Member States should report the same data in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates in later years as they report to Eurostat or the European Environment Agency. The use of the same source and, where available, of European statistics, is also essential to calculate the baseline for modelling and projections. Using European statistics will allow for a better comparability of the data and the projections used in the integrated national energy and climate plans. (12) All elements of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 are to be included in the final integrated national energy and climate plan. In this context, the macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmen\u00ad tal, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures should be assessed. The public and other stakeholders are to be engaged in the preparation of the final integrated national energy and climate plan. These and other elements are described in detail in staff working document published alongside this Recommendation ( 6 ). (13) In the final plan the United Kingdom should draw clearer links between the domestic policies and the Energy Union dimensions, as well as taking into account interlinkages between the planned policies and measures in the decarbonisation, energy security, internal market dimensions and research, innovation and competitiveness. Examples are the energy efficiency first principle, the impact of bioenergy use on the accounted emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry and how climate change risks affect the energy supply.

        "(14) The final integrated national energy and climate plan would benefit from presenting a comprehensive analysis on where the low-carbon technologies sector is currently positioned in the global market, highlighting areas of com\u00ad petitive strengths and potential challenges and pointing at measurable objectives for the future and policies and measures to achieve them, making appropriate links to enterprise and industrial policy. It could also benefit from consideration of the role of circular economy, referring to national strategies and action plans and raising their benefits and potential trade-offs in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction. (15) The Commission's recommendations to the United Kingdom are underpinned by the assessment of the United Kingdom's draft integrated national energy and climate plan which is published alongside this Recommendation ( 7 ). HEREBY RECOMMENDS THE UNITED KINGDOM TAKES ACTION TO: 1. Further specify and quantify the impacts of the additional policies and measures, also beyond the building and transport sectors, to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas target for sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading system of -37 % compared to 2005. This includes the corresponding commitment under Regulation (EU) No 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ) that land use, land use change and forestry emis\u00ad sions do not exceed removals and requires applying the underpinning accounting rules. 2. Put forward, as United Kingdom's contribution to the EU 2030 target for renewable energy, a renewable energy share of at least 27 % indicated by the formula in Annex II under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Include an indicative trajectory in the final integrated national energy and climate plan that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in accordance with that share, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts for reaching this target collectively. Put forward detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ), to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Increase the level of ambition in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and increase the level of ambition to meet the transport target in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide addi\u00ad tional details on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 3. Set national contributions that would be substantially more ambitious than the projections from the modelling quoted in the draft integrated national energy and climate plan in view of the need to increase the level of efforts to reach the Union's 2030 energy efficiency target. Propose more ambitious policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Indicate policies and measures for the whole 2021 to 2030 period. Provide an impact assessment for the planed policies and measures in energy efficiency, in particular in terms of expected energy savings they are to deliver. 4. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy depen\u00ad dency, including measures ensuring flexibility and the long-term supply of nuclear fuel, in view of the possible development of its nuclear generation capacity. 5. Define forward-looking objectives and targets concerning market integration, in particular outline a strategy and timeline for progressing towards fully market based prices. 6. Clarify the national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between 2023 and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. 7. Build on the framework of the North Seas Energy Cooperation regarding the exchange of good practices for off\u00ad shore wind support schemes and potential projects, in order to deliver on the Energy Union objectives of greater energy security, sustainability and competitiveness. In light of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, it should foresee measures to ensure continued regional cooperation with Ireland on emergency prepared\u00ad ness and response for electricity, and security of supply for gas and oil.
