        "BRIEFING Requested by the EMPL committee Study in Focus Fighting Child Poverty: the Role of EU Funding Background In the EU, child poverty has been increasingly understood as a context-specific, multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing not only a lack of money and assets but also other forms of deprivation connected to children\u2019s survival , development , protection and participation in decisions that affect their lives. The rights-based approach to child poverty (e.g. UNICEF) highlights the multiple factors contributing to child well-being and articulates children\u2019s right to an adequate standard of living , and to be free from deprivations across crucial aspects of their lives including their health , education , nutrition , care and protection . In 2017, the European Parliament has voted for a preparatory action to look at the feasibility of a rights-based child guarantee scheme which is currently being implemented. Focus of the Study The overall aim of this study is to assess how and to what extent Member States use EU funding to improve the situation of children at risk of poverty and social exclusion, in particular of those living in severe material deprivation . The study is based on desk research, interviews with stakeholders at EU level and in six Member States (BG, CZ, DE, IE, PL, PT and on a targeted survey of managing authorities. Key Findings 1. Patterns and trends in child poverty Monetary poverty is the main driver of multidimensional child poverty and children living in multidimensional poverty are more likely to experience themselves monetary poverty as adults (see fig. 1). According to Eurostat, in 2016, 25 million children in the European Union were at risk of poverty and social exclusion , and more than 8 million of them were living in severe material deprivation . While in a few countries the rate of children affected was below 3 % (SE 0.7 %; LU 1.2 %; FI 1.5 %; NL 2.5%), in other countries, up to one in three children were facing very poor living conditions (BG 36.1 %; RO 30.2%; EL 26.1 %; HU 21.1%). From 2008 to 2016 the share of children living in severe material deprivation increased in ten Member States with the largest rise in Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Ireland. Furthermore, in more than half of the Member States the proportion of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion increased from 2008 to 2016 including Germany, Spain, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden.

        "Fighting Child Poverty: The Role of EU Funding 2. Use of EU funds to fight child poverty Investments addressing specific problems of children living in material deprivation remain necessary to break the \u2018vicious circle of poverty\u2019. The study shows, however, that the design of EU funds in 2014- 2020 does not specifically address child poverty. FEAD is an exception as it provides food, material assistance and social inclusion activities to children suffering from severe material deprivation and its monitoring framework includes children aged 15 or below. According to administrative data, in 2014- 2016 as a result of FEAD funded interventions: \u2022 almost 11 million children received food support in the form of food packages or meals and they constituted a high share (29.6%) of all FEAD beneficiaries; \u2022 296,971 children received material assistance in the form of school materials; the total values of goods was over EUR 6.76 million ; \u2022 a small number of children received FEAD social inclusion assistance (e.g. in DE, DK, NL, SE). In Germany, 2 137 children received assistance, above all to increase partipicipation in early child and social care. ESF and ERDF allocations to the investment priorities targeting children can be only tracked at the level of categories of interventions and the precise scope of investments cannot be assessed from the available administrative data. These data only provide indications, that \u2022 25.6 % of the total ESF allocation of EUR 86.4 billion was earmarked for social inclusion measures ; \u2022 ESF allocations of EUR 8 billion were set aside for measures tackling early school leaving ; \u2022 under ERDF EUR 11.9 billion has been earmarked for measures promoting social inclusion and combating poverty , including alternative community-based care; \u2022 approximately EUR 5.9 billion of ERDF allocations has been earmarked for investment in education facilities , out of which EUR 1.22 billion were planned for childcare infrastructures . Analysis of EU funded intervention revealed that improved nutrition and affordable childcare services were among the main areas, where EU funding was effective, e.g.: \u2022 the ex-post evaluation of 2007-2013 Cohesion policy in the field of education in Poland showed that support aimed at making pre-school education more widespread and accessible had a huge impact on the availability of kindergarten places, especially in rural areas , characterized by high child poverty rates ; \u2022 according to the mid-term evaluation, FEAD had positive effects on the alleviation of food deprivation , especially for women and children, and material deprivation for children by financing targeted individual school material for school children and personal hygiene items for babies. 3. Recommendations to reinforce a focus on child poverty in EU funds post-2020 The study identifies a list of challenges for the post-2020 programming period which are particularly relevant in addressing child poverty problems in the EU funding cycle: \u2022 lack of strategic (specific) objectives referring to children in the relevant EU Regulations and EU funding rules; \u2022 weak specific policy response in the European Semester (National Reform Programmes and Country-Specific Recommendations), which then is linked to the programming of the relevant EU funding, as well as a lack of visibility of materially deprived children in the national and regional EU-funded programmes; PE 626.060 3 ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies \u2022 lack of a monitoring framework to measure the scope and outputs of investments targeting children due to the absence of relevant ESF and ERDF common indicators and relevant categories of intervention for financial data. Based on the analysis of the European Commission proposal for a Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) and Regulation on European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) , the study recommends a number of measures which may help to improve the focus of the relevant EU funds on fighting child poverty during the 2021- 2027 programming period: \u2022 ensuring that current references to children remain in the final version of ESF+ Regulation as each such instance has a trickle-down effect during the preparation and negotiations of the EU funds programmes; \u2022 encouraging policy discussion and target setting at national level, especially for those countries where material deprivation of children remains most acute ; \u2022 ensuring that relevant country-specific recommendations mentioning children at risk of poverty and social exclusion are directly taken on board in the preparation and negotiations of the relevant 2021-2027 EU funds programmes, possibly by setting a specific target for the programmes of the countries having the highest shares of materially deprived children; \u2022 ensuring that a reference to child poverty remains in the enabling condition which requires Member States to develop a National strategic policy framework for social inclusion and poverty reduction before investing ESF+ or ERDF in the selected areas. \u2022 including in a national policy framework an evidence-based diagnosis of poverty and social exclusion as well as of child poverty , homelessness, spatial and educational segregation, limited access to essential services and infrastructure , and of the specific needs of vulnerable people; \u2022 identifying the geographical territories with the highest rates of child poverty and with limitated access to essential services. At least for the member states having the highest shares of children living in severe material deprivation, it would be important to include a requirement to allocate a specific share of ESF+ (and possibly ERDF) resources to service provision targeted directly at children . This amount would go on top of, and ideally in close synergy with the 2 % of ESF+ allocated to material deprivation; \u2022 expanding the application of the aforementioned enabling condition to also cover the ESF+ specific objective \u201c(x) promoting social integration of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, including the most deprived and children \u201d; \u2022 considering the extension of the application of a common output indicator \u201c Number of children below 18 years of age \u201d to the whole ESF+ shared management; Disclaimer and copyright.
