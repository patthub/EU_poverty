        "Introduction The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions was created in 1975 with a mandate to 'contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this development.'(') The Foundation has developed in the past 25 years into a unique European centre in the societal field, providing research findings and information in response to the needs of policy makers and experts at EU level. Its tripartite structure, involving both Ell and national public authorities, employer and worker organisations, facilitates the active participation of these key actors in the development and implementation of its activities and creates an appropriate vehicle for the dissemination and discussion of its work outputs. The Foundation's stakeholders have recognised the changes in work and society that have taken place since the Foundation's creation. In that perspective they have reassessed the role and contribution of the Foundation. This has resulted in the four-year programme for 2001-2004, based on a series of guiding principles. The programme was approved by its Administrative Board on 21 September 2000. It sets out a strategic framework for the Foundation's contribution to the process of improving working and living conditions in the context of a radically transforming economy and society. This booklet contains an abridged version of the programme. Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director Eric Verborgh Deputy Director (') Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1365/75 of 26 May 1975. 2 2001 2004 ",
        "GUIDING PRINCIPLES \u25a0 Developing and consolidating key areas of activity: research/development, debate/discussion and information/dissemination \u25a0 Strengthening core areas of expertise - working conditions, living conditions and industrial relations - in order to be able to monitor and analyse trends on a comparative basis, identify and research emerging issues and respond in a timely and relevant way to the information needs of decision makers \u25a0 Focusing on fewer and more substantial research programmes rather than a multiplicity of projects, combined with more internal analysis of Foundation data and findings to meet the specific needs of key policy audiences, with an emphasis on an integrated and holistic view of issues across living and working conditions \u25a0 Reinforcing the Foundation's role as a forum for debate and taking advantage of the added value provided by its tripartite structure \u25a0 Implementing a more coherent and consistent communications strategy, making effective use of electronic media, and building networks and close working relationships with relevant bodies, to improve responsiveness to the information needs of policy makers, especially at EU level \u25a0 Increasing accountability, transparency and cost effectiveness, delivered through objective evaluation of the Foundation's performance, which will be included from the outset of programmes and activities. More active communication with, and feedback from, key users should form part of the monitoring and evaluation process \u25a0 Taking into account important changes in the European Union, especially the future enlargement of the EU to new Member States \u0390 & . \u03ca \u039a '\u0391 3 2001 2004 ",
        "The context and major changes In implementing the 2001\u00ad2004 programme, the Foundation will continue to monitor key developments and trends in the European Union such as: \u25a0 The ongoing evolution towards a knowledge\u00adbased society; \u25a0 The emergence of the new economy which is transforming business and markets and opening up new opportunities; \u25a0 The effects of globalisation, EMU and ongoing market reforms on Europe's economy; \u25a0 The rise of micro firms and SMEs; \u25a0 Unemployment rates and the low average rate of employment in the EU (62%); \u25a0 Low levels of labour market participation among women, older and disabled people; \u25a0 Skills and training deficits; \u25a0 The persistence of poverty and social exclusion; \u25a0 The ageing population and changing household/family structures; \u25a0 Increasing mobility and immigration, creating greater diversity; \u25a0 Sustainable development and environmental protection as key elements in social and economic development. Since the adoption of the Foundation's last four\u00adyear programme, there have been several significant changes in social and other policies at EU level, including: \u25a0 The 1997 Treaty on European Union, with its Employment Title and Social Protocol; \u25a0 Implementation of the European Employment Strategy, including the four pillars of its guidelines (employability, adaptability, entrepreneurship and equal opportunities); \u25a0 Strengthened partnership with the social partners and the increasingly impor\u00ad tant role of social dialogue at EU level; \u25a0 Recent initiatives regarding social inclusion and non\u00addiscrimination (arising from the broadening of EU competence in the social arena); \u25a0 The mainstreaming of employment, equal opportunities and social inclusion in EU funding programmes and other policy areas; \u25a0 Improved coordination and policy development in the area of social protection; \u25a0 The Conclusions of the Helsinki Summit of December 1999 which reinforced the importance of integrating environmental and sustainable development strategies into different economic and social policies. 4 2001 I 2004 ",
        "Recent EU Presidency summits and the Commission's European social policy agenda have reinforced these political developments. The agenda seeks to: 'ensure the positive and dynamic interaction of economic, employment and social policy and to forge a political agreement which mobilises all key actors to work jointly towards the new strategic goals.' The goal is that Europe should become: 'the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. ' Social policy as a productive factor is a guiding principle of this new agenda. Social expenditure is considered to be an investment in human capital with consequent increases in productivity and economic growth. The 2001-2004 programme of the Foundation is designed to contribute significantly to this new direction of EU social policy. Other important EU-level developments which are likely to have implications for the four-year programme include: \u25a0 The Charter of Fundamental Rights; \u25a0 Outcomes of the Intergovernmental Conference; \u25a0 Enlargement. EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY AGENDA 2000-200S - Creating more and better jobs -Anticipating and managing change Adapting to the new working environment \u25a0 Exploiting the potential of the knowledge society Promoting mobility _ Modernising and improving social protection Promoting social inclusion Strengthening gender equality \u25a0 Reinforcing fundamental rights _j Combating discrimination Preparing for enlargement \u03b9 Promoting international cooperation Strengthening the contribution of social dialogue 5 2001 I 2004 ",
        "Programme themes The 2001\u00ad2204 programme, like earlier ones, aims to provide both: CONTINUITY: building on expertise developed over 25 years; & INNOVATION: exploring emerging issues and responding to societal change. To achieve its objectives, the Foundation will undertake a dual approach, involving monitoring activities and strategic research, the latter based on both qualitative and quantitative methods. The research will be both reactive \u00ad responding to the information needs of target audiences \u00ad as well as proactive \u00ad carrying out investigations which are driven by changes on the ground. The content of the 2001-2004 programme can be summarised by the following three headings: CORE AREAS OF EXPERTISE Setting out the structure for the development and implementation of the programme around: \u25a0 Working conditions \u25a0 Industrial relations raa\u00abBei\u00bbssraKH>ss\u00e4; OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES Providing the possibility for the Foundation to explore and develop in an integrated way new or inadequately developed issues which emerge over the course of the programme. Defining the priorities for the content and direction of the programme to be developed on a transversal basis across the three core areas. This will enable the Foundation to respond more effectively to current issues of EU social policy: \u25a0 Promoting better employment \u25a0 Extending equal opportunities for men and women \u25a0 Managing diversity \u25a0 Supporting social inclusion \u25a0 Examining the use of time The Foundation will propose specific studies under its annual programmes of work which will address policy issues as identified under the transversal themes. Strategic research in all areas will respond both to the transversal themes and to the results of monitoring activities. 6 2001 I2004 ",
        "Wm H Core areas of expertise WORKING CONDITIONS A good quality of working life, together with the promotion of employment and entrepreneurship, is central to the EU employment strategy and social policy agenda. The scope of the Foundation's work in this area covers the entire range of factors which shape the day\u00adto\u00adday working environment. All of these have to be addressed if improvements are to be generated. They include the: \u25a0 Physical work environment \u25a0 Psychosocial work environment \u25a0 Organisation of work \u25a0 Management of human resources \u25a0 Legal and contractual environment. In the 2001\u00ad2004 programme, the Foundation will take account of the rapidly changing nature of work. The move towards a knowledge\u00adbased economy, the 24\u00adhour society, its effect on contractual relationships and the increasing impor\u00ad tance of the service economy, all have major implications for the quality of life both inside and outside work. Quality of employment, health and well\u00adbeing, social inclusion, equal opportunities and economic performance are some of the areas thus affected. Monitoring change The Foundation will further develop its own monitoring instruments in order to provide accurate data on how working conditions are changing and how policy may be affecting developments. These findings give a sound basis from which to launch more strategic in\u00addepth research. Four main types of monitoring activities are proposed for the 2001\u00ad2004 programme: \u25a0 European surveys on working conditions: the initial focus will be on analysis of the results of the third survey (2000), while preparation for the next survey, to take place in 2004, will commence; \u25a0 Sector surveys at EU level, both qualitative and quantitative, using data from literature, case studies, views of key actors and EIRO; \u25a0 The establishment of a company panel to provide the corporate perspective on issues such as human resources policies, equal opportunities and work organisation; \u25a0 Questionnaire surveys covering issues such as time, stress and equal opportu\u00ad nities. OBJECTIVES FOR THE CORE AREAS OF EXPERTISE - To monitor trends in living and working conditions and in industrial relations To identify progress made in improving living and working conditions \u25a0 To undertake research on ongoing problems and emerging issues To analyse collected information in the three areas and advise on EU policy development in an integrated, holistic way To prioritise the investigation of issues identified in the transversal themes To use research findings to support debate and discussion among the social partners and other key actors at EU level \u25a0 To communicate the Foundation's research appropriately for its various audiences _ To increase the visibility of the Foundation's work -\u00bb\u03cb! The Foundation will also combine this information with data from other sources. The priorities will be to fill the identified gap in relation to monitoring developments at the corporate/enterprise level and to continue the close collab\u00ad oration in areas of mutual concern with the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work in Bilbao. 7 2001 I 2004 ",
        "Strategie research The following topics are currently being investigated and will continue to be researched: \u25a0 Work organisation, working conditions and health; \u25a0 Ageing and work; \u25a0 Time and work; \u25a0 Design of workplaces; \u25a0 Promotion of gender equality; \u25a0 Employment and working conditions, focusing on: - labour market flexibility and working conditions; - new contractual relationships: - the impact of the new economy and knowledge-based society. Based on the analysis of the 2000 European survey on working conditions, further research will also be undertaken on the causes of problems identified in order to formulate possible solutions. The Foundation will also examine the potential to develop the monitoring and strategic research so as to provide: \u25a0 An accessible, high-quality, source of information on working conditions; \u25a0 A vehicle for regular reporting; \u25a0 A forum for debate. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS A considerable and very visible body of work has been undertaken by the Foundation in the area of industrial relations over many years. Issues examined include changes in the balance of roles between labour legislation and collective bargaining and the emergence of new structures such as the European Works Councils. Developments in the overall agenda of industrial relations, such as in equal opportunities, employment pacts, work organisation and working time, will continue to be important. Major factors which will influence the 2001-2004 programme include: EMU, the completion of the Single Market (ongoing liberalisation and privatisation), globalisation, the emergence of the knowledge society, the growing service sector, and the prevalence of more individualised practices in industrial relations. Monitoring change Monitoring activity will focus on tracking the changes mentioned above, using existing Foundation instruments and data generated elsewhere. Industrial relations systems and the key agenda topics will continue to be monitored. The European industrial relations observatory (EIRO) will become even more important as a monitoring tool and information resource, serving the needs both of the Foundation's programme and external audiences. A key challenge in this area will be to create greater synergy between the different monitoring tools in the industrial relations area and between them and strategic research projects. 8 2001 I 2004 ",
        "The following initiatives will be undertaken: \u25a0 E1RO will be integrated with the rest of the Foundation's programme; \u25a0 Its content will be further developed in line with user preferences, with significant increases in the number of comparative studies and articles; \u25a0 Its content will be expanded to include developments outside the EU; \u25a0 A thematic database within EIRO will be developed; \u25a0 Other monitoring instruments in the industrial relations area (the European Employment and Industrial Relations Glossaries and the European Works Councils database) will be reassessed to ensure synergy with monitoring tools in other areas; \u25a0 Increased monitoring of corporate\u00adlevel policies and practices; \u25a0 Development of new networks to include employers, workers' representatives, human resources managers, companies and business schools; \u25a0 All monitoring tools will be reviewed in relation to the priorities of the transversal themes. Strategic research Topics to be considered include: \u25a0 Modernisation of employment relations and the role of the social partners; \u25a0 Industrial change and working conditions; \u25a0 Gender equality; \u25a0 Developments in pay and working time; \u25a0 Information and consultation of workers; \u25a0 Impact of the knowledge\u00adbased economy; \u25a0 Financial participation; \u25a0 European Works Councils; \u25a0 Changes in work organisation (bargaining, legislative and company framework). LIVING CONDITIONS With a potentially very wide remit, the Foundation, as a tripartite body, will concentrate its work in this area on issues in which the public authorities (both European and national) and social partners have an interest. Two criteria are used, namely: \u25a0 Implications for the quality of living conditions of the changing nature of employment, work organisation and working conditions and of the moderni\u00ad sation of social protection and social services; \u25a0 The continuing need to understand and address disparities, especially those resulting from poverty and unemployment, and to identify new opportunities and risks in the move towards a knowledge\u00adbased economy and society. In the 2001\u00ad2004 programme, the Foundation will focus on the influence that the changing world of work \u00ad and related policies \u00ad has on standards of living for different groups in society and on the options and opportunities open to them. Factors influencing living conditions, which will continue to be exam\u00ad ined, include the transition between work and personal life, the impact of a differentiated labour market with increasing flexibility, access and attitudes to work, variances in employment status and working times, modernisation and reform of social protection systems and social public services. 9 ' .'I I /\"!\". ",
        "Monitoring change The following monitoring activities are proposed for the 2001-2004 programme: \u25a0 Re-examining ongoing requirements for quantitative, as well as qualitative data; \u25a0 Exploring requirements for new surveys; \u25a0 Building specific data collection networks; \u25a0 Developing more complex indicators on living conditions, taking account of the scope of the area as defined by the Foundation, the priorities of the transversal themes and the information needs of the target audiences. Particular focus will be placed on gathering quantitative information on access to the labour market and other paths for social integration (looking at people's preferences, expectations, opportunities and experiences). Data on citizen access to public services such as health, education and social protection will also be relevant. The Foundation will seek to develop further its collaboration with Eurostat ane other Commission services on living conditions data, including changing patterns of time use. There is also significant potential for the development of new networks involving the social partners and government interests, alongside representatives from civil society and research experts. Strategic research Strategic research initiatives put forward under the annual programmes of work will, again, seek to respond both to the transversal themes and to the results of monitoring. The following topics will be considered (some of them are already underway): \u25a0 Integrated policy approaches to improve quality employment opportunities for vulnerable groups; \u25a0 New relationships between work and personal life over the life course; \u25a0 Access to the knowledge-based economy and society; \u25a0 Lifelong learning; \u25a0 Equal opportunities and non-discrimination in social public services and in social and civil life; \u25a0 Strategies to combat poverty and unemployment in disadvantaged regions. Following a recommendation of the European Commission and a decision of the Nice Council of December 2000, the Foundation has undertaken to establish a European Monitoring Centre on Change. This initiative is supported by the social partners. The core mission of the centre will be to identify, assess and process relevant information on the driving forces of change in the European economy, consequent on globalisation, new technologies and changing consumer demand. It will provide the main actors with reliable and objective data on aspects of industrial change such as restructuring, organisation of work and labour, mergers and acquisitions, skills transformation and adaptation to technological change. The centre will draw on and support the three core areas of the Foundation's work, thus acting as a transversal tool. The activities will be managed directly by the Foundation's Directorate and governed by an autonomous Steering Committee, reflecting the composition of the Administrative Board. ",
        "Transversal themes Transversal themes are designed to bring greater consistency, coherence and an integrated approach across the three core areas of working conditions, industrial relations and living conditions. They are also a means of strengthening the Foundation's capacity to respond to the information needs of its audiences. The themes that the Foundation has prioritised for the next four years are: \u25a0 Promoting better employment; \u25a0 Extending equal opportunities for men and women; \u25a0 Managing diversity; \u25a0 Supporting social inclusion; \u25a0 Examining the changing use of time. The main priority will continue to be employment, which is an important component of the other four themes and the main linking factor. For these transversal themes, the Foundation will deliver specific contributions in the form of position papers. OBJECTIVES FOR THE TRANSVERSAL THEMES \u03c0 To enable the Foundation to match its work outputs more closely with the needs of its audiences _ To facilitate more effective, responsive and timely communication To clarify the deliverables for this programme To provide a focus for work across the three core areas and improve coherence between them - To offer a more effective and transparent basis for project selection and prioritisation of activities in the annual programme Promoting better employment The European Employment Strategy (EES) and the four pillars of its guidelines (employability, adaptability, entrepreneurship and equal opportunities) have formed the basis for EU action on employment since 1997. Recent develop\u00ad ments have emphasised that the objective is not merely more jobs, but also better quality employment. There are three main areas in employment to which the Foundation's research will contribute significantly in the 2001\u00ad2004 programme. \u25a0 Quality of employment and of working conditions, including work organisation; \u25a0 Access to employment and self\u00ademployment and to opportunities and support for labour market participation, as a means to promote a more cohesive society; \u25a0 Conditions and/or best practices at the workplace which facilitate the creation of companies and increase their life expectancy. Extending equal opportunities for men and women The Foundation aims to contribute work on the following topics over the next four years: \u25a0 Gender and employment, with a specific focus on work organisation, working time and flexibility, access to employment opportunities and integration in the labour market; \u25a0 Equal opportunities in relation to participation and representation, at the workplace and in the wider community; \u25a0 Equality in social and civil life, with regard to access to goods and services, to health, to social protection and to leisure and family life. The Foundation may also examine the process of gender mainstreaming itself. 2O01 I 20O4 ",
        "Managing diversity Building on opportunities to create a more cohesive society in Europe and highlight the benefits of diversity, the Foundation will identify policies and concrete experiences aimed at: \u25a0 Managing diversity from a perspective of competitiveness and productivity and the improvement of working conditions for all workers; \u25a0 Increasing social integration and improving access to quality employment by promoting non-discrimination. Supporting social inclusion The Foundation will build on earlier work undertaken in this area by contributing to the following issues: \u25a0 Relationships between employment and social inclusion (in the context of increasing labour market flexibility and differentiation); \u25a0 Roles of public authorities, social partners, NGOs and the legal system in promoting social inclusion; \u25a0 Involvement of excluded groups in decision-making processes, which affect living and working conditions; \u25a0 Modernisation of social protection and its role in eliminating and insuring against exclusion. Examining the changing use of time The use and management of time is a critical factor, influencing developments in employment, social inclusion and equal opportunities. The Foundation's contribution to further work on this transversal theme between 2001-2004 will cover: \u25a0 Developments in working time and the implications for working conditions; \u25a0 Linkages between different uses of time, particularly between working and personal time, and their implications for quality of life; \u25a0 New negotiation processes and new actors involved in the reorganisation of time use in society. 12 ",
        "Other developmental activities The programme outlined above means a heavy commitment for the Foundation over the next four years. However, space must also be found to undertake exploratory and more experimental work on new issues on a transversal basis, in order to respond to policy development and information needs in the post\u00ad 2004 period. It is important that the Foundation continues to anticipate new developments and create awareness of these, as this has been one of its strengths in the past. Such developmental work will encompass research, networks\u00adbuilding and the fostering of exchanges of information and expertise with experts in the areas concerned. Two themes are currently under consideration for the 2001\u00ad2004 programme: \u25a0 The impact of the transition towards a knowledge\u00adbased economy and society on living and working conditions; \u25a0 Migration and mobility. In addition, the Foundation will investigate the implications of EU enlarge\u00ad ment for existing Member States and applicant countries. In the 2001\u00ad2004 programme, the Foundation's contribution to this process of change will include: \u25a0 Extension of the Foundation's research and monitoring activities to applicant countries; \u25a0 Participation in Foundation seminars and conferences by relevant experts and representatives of these countries; \u25a0 Negotiation of bilateral agreements covering such participation. Proposals to extend the Foundation's networks in the framework of enlarge\u00ad ment will be influenced by financial, practical and institutional considerations. OBJECTIVES FOR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES \u25a0 To investigate a small number of new and emerging issues in an integrated and holistic way, drawing on the three core areas of Foundation expertise \u25a0 To explore new methodologies and other ways to fulfil the mandate of the Foundation \u25a0 To draw, at an early stage, the attention of policy makers to new risks and opportunities, enhancing a preventative approach to the improvement of living and working conditions 13 2001 2004 ",
        "Communication and information The Foundation will prioritise the creation of a more coherent, visible and consistent communications strategy over the next four years in order to deliver: \u25a0 Clearer messages from its work \u25a0 Quicker response times \u25a0 Enhanced tailoring of products and services to meet the needs of target audiences \u25a0 More balanced dissemination across all Member States \u25a0 Increased use of relays and networks with outside bodies OBJECTIVES FOR COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION \u25a0 To design and implement the Foundation's work in consultation with key stakeholders \u25a0 To establish the Foundation as a centre of expertise and to reinforce its role as a forum for debate \u25a0 To communicate regularly with target audiences based on a planned approach \u03b9 To develop appropriate communications vehicles which can deliver timely and useable information \u03b9 To organise Foundation information for easy retrieval and re-use \u03b9 To create a web-based system for capturing the Foundation's knowledge and making it widely accessible \u03b9 To meet the demand for a multi-lingual communications mix The objectives for the communication and information plan will be met through a series of strategic action plans. Specific strategies will be established to strengthen the linkages and networks used by the Foundation to develop and disseminate information. Where appropriate, alliances and contacts will be established with the information intermediaries within the organisations of target audiences in all Member States and at EU level. 14 2001 2004 ",
        "A priority will be to ensure that working and communication links are strength\u00ad ened with other European agencies working in related fields such as those in Bilbao (health and safety at work), Copenhagen (environment and sustainable development), Thessaloniki (vocational training in the EU) and Turin (vocational training for partner countries). A review of existing information channels will be undertaken, with the aim of providing a more pro\u00adactive and effective information service. Research reports, newsletters, websites, media relations, annual reports and other products will all be audited for professionalism, quality and relevance to the target audiences. Audience Audience identification is essential to ensure effective communication. The priority target audiences are clearly mentioned in the Foundation's founding Council Regulation and comprise the EU institutions and bodies represented on the Administrative Board (the social partners and governments of the Member States). The full range of users of the Foundation's information extends beyond this group to include: \u25a0 Individuals within the institutions of the EU, Member State governments, employers' and trades union organisations who are involved in EU policy development in the areas of working conditions, living conditions and industrial relations; \u25a0 Decision\u00admakers on the funding and future of the Foundation (the Budget Committee of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers); \u25a0 European social NGOs and international organisations in the social policy field; \u25a0 Entrepreneurs, managers, trade unionists and professionals; \u25a0 The academic community, \u25a0 The media; \u25a0 The general public. A forum for debate Given the tripartite structure of the Foundation and its role in the collection and analysis of policy\u00adrelevant data, it is a natural forum for the discussion of social policy issues by the main social actors. The Foundation will maintain its role as a platform for dialogue and discussion among policy makers and the world of research by continuing to host a wide range of meetings, also in conjunction with the European Commission, EU Presidencies and other bodies. It plans to launch a new initiative, in the shape of an annual conference, in order to create a wider European forum for discussion on working and living conditions and industrial relations. This event is designed to facilitate more integrated debate on issues relevant to the social policy agenda and will bring together the social actors with relevant experts for a dialogue fuelled by Foundation research results. It is intended to hold the first such annual conference in 2002: its theme will be defined in the annual programme of work. 15 2001 I 2004 ",
        "J\u00ca\u00ca\u00cam \u00ab\u00a1BKHBS Evaluation To support the programme's implementation, the Foundation will introduce improved systems for the monitoring and evaluation of its processes and out\u00ad comes in addition to enhanced measures for quality control and resource allo\u00ad cation. These will assist in the management of the Foundation's activities as well as provide a baseline for the evaluation of its effectiveness. OBJECTIVES FOR EVALUATION \u25a0 To support organisational decision-making through the provision of data on the operation of the programme, with a view to remedying problems and strengthening effectiveness \u25a0 To ensure accountability to key stakeholders \u25a0 To improve resource allocation \u25a0 To assess the extent to which the Foundation is achieving its mandate and objectives The Foundation will institute evaluation as an integral part of its working methods. Evaluation by externally contracted experts, to cover the activities of the Foundation for the period 1997\u00ad2000, will be undertaken to assess the extent to which the Foundation's work has met global and operational objectives and contributed to action designed to improve living and working conditions. Internal evaluation processes will also be developed to assess the implementation of this four\u00adyear programme and its outcomes. In particular, intermediate (end 2002) and ex\u00adpost (end 2004) evaluations will be carried out. These evaluations \u00ad both external and internal \u00ad will form part of the annual work programmes of the Foundation during 2001\u00ad2004. Improving the Foundation's system for monitoring its own processes and out\u00ad comes will be the focus of specific attention. Quality standards, underpinned by key performance indicators, will be developed with a view to ensuring consistently high standards in all areas of work. Resources The Foundation will continue to develop its mechanisms for ensuring the most efficient allocation of funds and staff resources. The programme's strategic guidelines and objectives provide a framework for setting priorities for the annual budget and programme of work. Resources need to be strengthened in the areas of research, information and communication in order to implement this four\u00adyear programme. The Foundation intends to increase operational staff following internal reallocation of posts. A revised organisation of work and procedures will foster creativity and initiative, as well as facilitate delegation of responsibility. A new human resources policy, including targeted training and development, will support these new structures. 16 2001 I 2004 ",
