RECALLING that Article 167(3) and (4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) calls on the Union and its Member States to foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of culture, and invites the Union to take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaties, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures; 2. EMPHASISING that culture in the EU's external relations, including in development cooperation, is one of the priorities of the European Agenda for Culture ( 1 ) and the subsequent Council work plans for culture ( 2 ) and that cross-sectorial cooperation is important to increase coherence between different policies as underlined in a number of recently adopted Council conclusions ( 3 ); 3. BEARING IN MIND that according to Article 208 TFEU, Union policy in the field of development cooperation shall be conducted within the framework of the principles and objectives of the Union's external action and that the Union's development cooperation policy and that of the Member States complement and reinforce each other; 4. RECALLING the adoption by the United Nations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ( 4 ) which contains explicit references to culture in several of its goals as well as the Council conclusions of 16 December 2014 on a transformative post-2015 agenda ( 5 ), which recognise that culture, including world cultural heritage and creative industries, can have an important role in achieving inclusive and sustainable development; 5.

RECALLING that the EU and its Member States have acceded, and thus committed themselves to the implementation of the 2005 Unesco Convention on the protection and the promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions that emphasises, inter alia, the need to incorporate culture as a strategic element in development policies and that cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed; IS CONVINCED that culture needs to form part of a strategic and cross-cutting approach to the Union's external relations and development cooperation given its substantial capacity to reinforce these policies by contributing to the building of long-term relationships based on people-to-people exchange, mutual understanding, trust and credibility; WITH DUE REGARD to the respective spheres of competence of the European Union and of the Member States, as well as to the principle of subsidiarity; UNDERLINES THE FOLLOWING: Regarding culture in the EU's external relations 7. To realise culture's potential to be an important part of external relations, it is necessary to go beyond projecting the diversity of European cultures, and aim at generating a new spirit of dialogue, mutual listening and learning, 15.12.2015 C 417/41 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Endorsed by the Council resolution of 16 November 2007 on a European Agenda for Culture (OJ C 287, 29.11.2007, p. 1).

        "joint capacity building and global solidarity ( 1 ), as recommended by the Preparatory Action on culture in EU external relations ( 2 ) and the report on culture and external relations with China ( 3 ). 8. There is, however, a need for a better coordination of efforts towards a strategic European approach aiming at the consistent and coherent integration of culture in the EU's external relations and contributing to the complementarity of the Union's activities with those of its Member States. Such an approach would include, inter alia, thematic and geographic priorities, realistic objectives and outcomes, target groups, common interests and initiatives, financing provisions, citizens participation and implementation modalities. 9. A strategic approach at the EU level would also enable current challenges, such as the migratory crisis, radicalisation and xenophobia, the destruction of and threat to cultural heritage and the illicit trafficking in cultural objects, to be addressed more efficiently. Regarding culture in development cooperation 10. Promoting policy coherence is particularly crucial for development cooperation, given the important role that the Member States and the EU play in this area and with regard also to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 11. Culture is an essential component of the human, social, economic and environmental dimension of development and therefore a key element of sustainable development, given that: \u2014 dynamic cultural and creative sectors, including cultural heritage, in partner countries can contribute to poverty reduction, as they are important catalysts for growth, employment, social cohesion and local development, \u2014 culture as well as the promotion and respect of cultural diversity play an important role in conflict prevention, peace building and reconciliation in conflict and post-conflict zones, \u2014 intercultural dialogue fosters better understanding and facilitates deeper partnerships between stakeholders, \u2014 an independent cultural and media sector is a fundamental condition for freedom of opinion and expression, cultural diversity, active democratic citizenship and a sustainable democratic development, \u2014 the adoption of specific culture and development cooperation strategies leads to more effective and sustainable actions in a large number of sectors. 12. Nevertheless, in order to take full advantage of the strong potential of culture for development cooperation, a more integrated approach should be developed that includes the mainstreaming of the cultural dimension in development programmes and an appropriate support to cultural operators on a longer term basis rather than one-off interventions. 13. Such an approach could be based, inter alia, upon the following elements: \u2014 recognition of the value of culture in its own right and as a vector for development cooperation, \u2014 definition, on the basis of a common understanding of coherence and consistency, of practical ways to mainstream the cultural dimension when preparing sectorial development programmes, \u2014 support for a structured and long-term development of the cultural and creative sectors in partner countries, notably in terms of capacity-building, cultural governance and intellectual property systems, \u2014 the strengthening of efforts to protect and safeguard the world's tangible and intangible cultural and natural heritage, 15.12.2015 C 417/42 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Also in line with the European Parliament resolution of 12 May 2011 on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions. ( 2 ) Initiated by the European Parliament in 2012, the Preparatory Action on \u2018Culture in EU External Relations\u2019 was carried out in 2012-2013 with the aim to support on-going policy reflection and development on strengthening the role of culture in external relations and to nurture further work in this area. The final report was published in 2014, http://cultureinexternalrelations.eu/main-outcomes/ ( 3 ) A strategy for EU-China cultural relations: report of the expert group on culture and external relations \u2014 China (November 2012). ",
        "\u2014 the promotion of the role of education in fostering pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between men and women, \u2014 the setting of a realistic number of priority lines that may be regularly reviewed to have a clear understanding of projects' results and their contribution to sustainable development and poverty reduction as well as to social cohesion, growth and jobs, \u2014 complementarity between existing programmes and financing schemes and instruments of the Union, the Member States and other actors and, when appropriate, the increase of opportunities to support cultural initiatives therein, \u2014 a bottom-up approach that fosters national and local ownership, involves partner countries and engages all stakeholders, in particular NGOs, civil society and the private sector. 14. A prompt reaction would be particularly important in view of the future implementation and monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda ( 1 ) so as to ensure that culture is sufficiently considered and can play its role in that regard. THEREFORE INVITES THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION TO: 15. Participate in an ad-hoc task group that will be hosted by Luxembourg. This group shall contribute to the preparation of a concrete, evidence-based, shared and long-term approach on culture and development cooperation. In order to facilitate coherence of actions between relevant actors on the ground, the group shall collect and exchange best practices on culture and development cooperation and examine the empirical evidence on the impact of culture on development. The group will meet for the initial period 2016 \u2014 2017, will be informal by nature and voluntary in participation.
