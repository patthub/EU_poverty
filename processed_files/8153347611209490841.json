        "Statistics in focus Population and social conditions Authors: Anna RYBKOWSKA, Micha SCHNEIDER 4/2011 Housing conditions in Europe in 2009 30 million people in the EU suffered both lack of space and poor housing conditions As stated by the European Commission 1 housing deprivation is one of the most extreme examples of poverty and social exclusion in society today. Although access to affordable accommodation is a fundamental need and right, guaranteeing this right still represents a significant challenge in several Member States. COM(2010) 758 final- Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. \u201cThe European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion: A European framework for social and territorial cohesion\u201d December 2010 In 2009, 6.0 % of the EU population suffered from severe housing deprivation (see methodological notes). The most frequent problems were noise from the neighbourhood (22.2 %), overcrowding (17.8 %) and pollution, grime or other environmental problems (16.5 %). In addition, 12.2 % of people in the EU lived in households affected by high housing costs.

        "2 4/2011 \u2014 Statistics in focus Some 30 million people in the EU affected by severe housing deprivation In 2009 some 30 million of the EU-27 population lived in households that faced severe housing deprivation. This is defined as the percentage of the population living in a dwelling which is considered to be overcrowded (see methodological notes), and with at least one of the following three housing situations: 1) a leaking roof, or damp walls, floors, foundations, or rot in window frames or floor (referred afterwards as \u2018leaking roof\u2019), 2) neither a bath, nor a shower, nor an indoor flushing toilet, or 3) too dark. In 12 Member States, and in Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, the severe housing deprivation rate was below 3 %, i.e. half the EU-27 average (6.0 %). In particular, less than 1 % of the population in Cyprus, the Netherlands, Finland and Norway lived in households that faced severe housing deprivation. In contrast, more than 18 % (i.e. 3 times EU-27 average) of the population had severe problems related to housing in Bulgaria and Latvia, with a peak of 28.6 % in Romania. People living in households with dependent children more affected by severe housing deprivation With a rate of 8.6 %, people living in households with dependent children were more than twice as badly affected by severe housing deprivation as those living in households without dependent children (3.1 %). The peak of 16.7 % was recorded for persons belonging to a household with three or more adults and dependent children. Among those with dependent children the least deprived were not surprisingly people from the households composed of two adults and one dependent child (4.3 %). For people living in households without dependent children, severe housing deprivation affected primarily individuals living in households with three or more adults (6.4 %), more often than single males (3.7 %) or single females (2.4 %). Severe housing deprivation rate for persons living in households composed of only two adults was among the lowest (1.6 %).

        "Statistics in focus \u2014 4/2011 3 People at risk of poverty more likely to suffer lack of living space Among the components of the severe material deprivation rate, one of the key dimensions in assessing the quality of housing conditions is the availability of sufficient space in the dwelling. A person\u2019s living conditions are considered as overcrowded if the household does not have at its disposal a minimum number of rooms equal to: one room for the household; one room per couple in the household; one room for each single person aged 18 or more; one room per pair of single people of the same gender between 12 and 17 years of age; one room for each single person between 12 and 17 years of age and not included in the previous category; and one room per pair of children under 12 years of age. In 2009, 17.8 % of the EU population lived in overcrowded dwellings. The overcrowding rate exceeded 50 % in Hungary (55.0 %), Romania (55.3 %) and Latvia (57.7 %), while the lowest percentages were recorded in Cyprus (1.0 %) and the Netherlands (1.7 %). The population at risk of poverty, i.e. individuals living in households where equivalised (i.e. per individual) disposable income is below 60 % of the national median, was more likely to be living in overcrowded conditions (30.1 % at the EU-27 level). The highest percentages were recorded in Hungary (75.4 %), Poland (64.9 %) and Romania (64.8 %), while the lowest were in Cyprus (2.7 %), Spain (5.1 %), the Netherlands (5.5 %) and Malta (5.6 %). In Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium as well as in Norway the percentage of persons at risk of poverty living in overcrowded conditions was more than three times higher than for the total population.

        "4 4/2011 \u2014 Statistics in focus Leaking roofs, damp or rot in window frames were the most frequent problems Housing quality can also be judged by the availability of certain basic sanitary facilities in the dwelling (such as a bath or shower or indoor flushing toilet) and by the general condition of the dwelling (whether the roof leaks or the dwelling is perceived as too dark). At EU level 15.9 % of the population deemed a \u2018leaking roof\u2019 to be a problem. Darkness in the dwelling was considered as a problem by 7.3 % of people in the EU, while less than 4 % lacked basic sanitary facilities. Over one fourth of the population in Latvia, Cyprus and Slovenia was living in a dwelling where a \u2018leaking roof\u2019 was considered as a problem. The lowest figures here were recorded in the Nordic countries: Finland (4.9 %), Sweden (6.6 %) and Denmark (7.8 %), as well as in Slovakia (6.6 %). Among the various housing deprivation items, a \u2018leaking roof\u2019 was the most frequent problem in all countries except Bulgaria and Romania (lack of flushing toilet). In 18 Member States and in Iceland, Norway and Switzerland less than 1 % of the population had no bath, shower or flushing toilet in the dwelling. At the other extreme, more than 40 % of people in Romania had no bath or shower, or no indoor flushing toilet (41.2 % and 42.5 % respectively), followed by Bulgaria (15.6 % and 26.2 % respectively) and the Baltic States (all three over 10 % for both indicators). Darkness in the dwelling was considered as a problem primarily in Slovenia (15.5 %), Latvia (10.9 %) and the United Kingdom (10.6 %).

        "Statistics in focus \u2014 4/2011 5 Intensity of housing deprivation was higher in Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states Counting the number of items related to housing deprivation (e.g. \u2018leaking roof\u2019, no bath or shower, no indoor flushing toilet or a dark dwelling) per individual gives an indication of the intensity of housing deprivation. In 2009, 6.0% of the EU population lived in a dwelling that was affected by at least two of the above mentioned four problems. The share of population concerned with three problems or more was negligible in most countries. The share of population living in dwellings affected by at least two problems was the highest in Romania (43.3 %) followed by Latvia (21.3%), Bulgaria (20.0%), Lithuania (19.4%), and Estonia (13.1%). On the other hand, in 7 EU countries and in Iceland, Switzerland and Norway no-one lived in a dwelling that was affected by more than two problems.

        "6 4/2011 \u2014 Statistics in focus Noise was the most commonly perceived problem around the home Housing quality depends not only on the quality of the dwelling itself, but also on the wider residential area. In this case the indicators rely on the subjective opinion of the respondents, but they do have the advantage of drawing a more complete picture of housing conditions. In 2009 22.2 % of EU-27 population lived in a dwelling where noise from neighbours or from the street was perceived as a problem. Over 30 % of people in Romania and Cyprus were concerned with noise, followed by Malta (27.8 %), Italy (26.0 %), Germany (25.8 %) and the Netherlands (25.3 %). At the other extreme, the rates were lowest in Ireland (10.4 %), Iceland and Norway (both 11.8 %) and Estonia (12.7 %). 16.5 % of the EU-27 population perceived the area in which they live as affected by pollution or other environmental problems. At country level the figures ranged from less than 10 % in Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland to over 30 % in Latvia and Malta. Crime and/or vandalism were perceived as a problem by 16.0 % of the EU-27 population. At country level the rates were highest in Bulgaria (28.6 %), Latvia (25.4 %) and the United Kingdom (25.1 %), while only 4.2 % of the population in Iceland, 5.3 % in Norway 6.6 % in Lithuania, and 6.7 % in Poland thought this a problem.

However, housing-related expenditure often accounts for a high share of household disposable income which could prevent some people from fulfilling this need. The \u2018housing cost overburden rate\u2019 is defined as the percentage of the population living in a household where the total cost of housing exceeds 40 % of their equivalised disposable income. Housing costs include mortgage or housing loans interest payments for owners and rent payments for tenants. Utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating) and any costs related to regular maintenance and structural insurance are likewise included. In 2009, 12.2 % of the EU population lived in a household that spent more than 40 % of their equivalised disposable income on housing. The housing cost overburden rate was highest in Denmark (24.4 %), followed by Germany (23.6 %) and Greece (22.2 %). ",
        "Statistics in focus \u2014 4/2011 7 In contrast, the indicator related to only 2.5 % of the population in Cyprus and less than 4 % in France, Malta, Luxembourg and Slovenia. In most countries the housing cost overburden rate for tenants paying a market rent was higher than for owners and persons paying reduced rent or enjoying rent-free accommodation; the only exceptions were Latvia, Slovakia and Sweden. In Latvia and Slovakia the percentages were higher for home-owners with a mortgage, and in Sweden for tenants who paid a reduced rent or occupied free accommodation. In 19 Member States and in Iceland and Norway the lowest housing cost overburden rates were found for outright owners (i.e. without a mortgage).

        "Statistics in focus \u2014 4/2011 11 Methodological notes Background At the Laeken European Council in December 2001, European heads of state and government endorsed a first set of common statistical indicators of social exclusion and poverty; these are subject to a continuing process of refinement by the Indicators Sub-Group of the Social Protection Committee. These indicators are an essential element in the Open Method of Coordination to monitor the progress made by Member States in combating poverty and social exclusion. EU-SILC was set up to provide the underlying data for these indicators. Organised under a Framework Regulation 1177/2003, it is now the reference source for statistics on income and living conditions and for common indicators for social inclusion in particular. Under the Europe 2020 agenda, the European Council adopted in June 2010 a headline target on social inclusion. EU-SILC is also the reference source for the three sub-indicators on which this new target is based. Data source All figures are based on data from EU-SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). The data on housing conditions are collected at the household level, and are afterwards allocated to all individuals living in the same household. All data are available at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/porta l/income_social_inclusion_living_conditions/dat a/database Severe housing deprivation rate The severe housing deprivation rate corresponds to the share of the population living in a dwelling which is considered as overcrowded, while also exhibiting at least one of the housing deprivation measures. Housing deprivation is a measure of poor amenities and is calculated by reference to households with a leaking roof, neither a bath, nor a shower, nor an indoor flushing toilet, or a dwelling considered too dark. Overcrowding rate A person is considered as living in an overcrowded dwelling if the household does not have at its disposal a minimum number of rooms equal to: \u2212 one room for the household; \u2212 one room per couple in the household; \u2212 one room for each single person aged 18 or more; \u2212 one room per pair of single people of the same gender between 12 and 17 years of age; \u2212 one room for each single person between 12 and 17 years of age and not included in the previous category; \u2212 one room per pair of children under 12 years of age. Housing cost overburden rate The housing cost overburden rate is defined as the share of the population living in households where the total cost of housing (\u2018net\u2019 of housing allowances) accounts for more than 40 % of household disposable income (\u2018net\u2019 of housing allowances). EU average EU aggregates appear as the population- weighted averages of national indicators. Abbreviations For the purpose of this publication EU means EU-27.
