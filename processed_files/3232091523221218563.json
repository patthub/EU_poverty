        "4 FOREWORD (cid:3) In the last decade the EU has put in place several policies and actions designed to promote language education and to support the development of the educational systems in Member States. The principal reasons for EU support to language learning have been both economical and societal. Since the European Union is built around the free movement of people, capital and goods, EU support to languages has aimed at strengthening the language skills and competences of its inhabitants in order to facilitate their participation in the European and the global market. Furthermore, the EU is equally conscious that linguistic diversity is a fundamental component of European culture and this must be supported at European level. Last but not least, a shared understanding of languages and intercultural dialogue can contribute to increased social cohesion. The key milestones for multilingualism policies in the last 10 years have been the 2004-2006 Action Plan Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity 1 , which committed the European Commission to introducing the European Indicator of Language Competence designed to provide data and comparisons related to foreign language teaching and learning, and the Commission Communication Multilingualism: an asset to for Europe and a shared commitment 2 , which was followed by a Council resolution on a European strategy for multilingualism on 21 November 2008. Currently, language learning is part of the strategy for reaching the employment rate benchmarks established in the ET2020 strategy for EU jobs and growth 3 . The \"Barcelona objective\" 4 , which includes the goal of encouraging EU citizens to speak their \"mother tongue plus two foreign languages\" is still a valid objective for Member States many years on. EU support for European multilingualism continues to be strong and in the new Erasmus+ programme (2014-2020) multilingualism is mainstreamed across its different Key Actions in order to support the mobility of students, volunteers and staff of education and training institutions. In addition, the European Commission will continue to implement European Language Label (ELL) initiative 5 in the period 2014 to 2020, which will certainly contribute to the dissemination of results and awareness-raising about languages in the participating countries. The aim of this publication is to showcase a sample of 35 best practice projects in languages funded under the Lifelong Learning Programme (2007-2013) and its specifically language-focused funding scheme. The implementation of these projects has been monitored and managed by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency on behalf of the European Commission. Projects are grouped thematically, ranging from early childhood education, inclusive and special needs education to Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), and the link between languages and respectively ICT and employability. Projects having successfully addressed Less Widely Used and Taught Languages (LWUTL) are also presented in this brochure as this is a particularly relevant illustration of the cultural diversity of Europe. 1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:c11068 2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:ef0003 3 http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm 4 http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/ 5 http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/strategic-framework/language-label_en.htm ",
        "5 For each sample, a description of the project objectives and results as well as the languages addressed is provided. I believe these examples will be a useful source of information for anyone interested in multilingualism in general and in funding by the European Union in this area. Moreover, I am confident that this brochure will inspire language educators, practitioners and policy-makers to foster multilingualism in their own context.

        "6 INTRODUCTION (cid:3)(cid:3) The Lifelong Learning Programme (2007-2013) As the flagship European Funding programme in the field of education and training between 2007 and 2013 6 , the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) was designed to encourage lifelong learning for the development of the European Union as an advanced knowledge society with sustainable economic development, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion 7 . The Lifelong Learning Programme was an umbrella programme bringing together various educational and training initiatives: four sectoral sub-programmes (Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Grundtvig) and the Transversal programme. The four sub-programmes covered the entire learning cycle of individuals from early childhood through to school, higher education and vocational training, up to adult life. The Transversal programme complemented the four sectoral sub-programmes by providing a means of supporting trans-sectoral activity in the fields of languages and ICT and to strengthen the dissemination and exploitation of results of the programme. It also fostered European co- operation in fields that cover at least two of the sub-programmes, therefore bridging several educational sectors. The Transversal Programme consisted of four key activities (KA): (cid:120) (cid:3) Policy Co-operation and Innovation in Lifelong Learning (KA1) (cid:120) (cid:3) Languages (KA2) (cid:120) (cid:3) Development of Innovative ICT-based Content, Services, Pedagogies and Practice for Lifelong Learning (KA3) (cid:120) (cid:3) Dissemination and Exploitation of Results and Exchange of Good Practice (KA4) For more information on the Lifelong Learning Programme, please visit: http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/index_en.php 6 The last Calls for Proposals under the Lifelong Learning Programme were published during the course of 2013; selected projects will still be running up to 2016. 7 Decision No 1720/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:327:0045:0068:EN:PDF ",
        "7 Key Activity 2 (KA2) \u2013 Languages The commitment of the EU Member States to work together and benefit from the rich heritage and cultural background of each country, including different languages, is in the basis of the motto of the European Union 'United in diversity' 8 . As linguistic diversity is a fact of life in Europe, learning languages can open many doors and have a positive impact on social cohesion. For individuals, it can pave the path to better career prospects and help them to live, study or work abroad. For companies, multilingual staff can ease access to European and global markets, thus increasing the competitiveness of the European economy. Language projects could, next to projects on other topics, be funded under each of the sectoral sub-programmes of the LLP, targeting one educational sector. In addition, as one of the four key activities of the Transversal programme, KA2 - Languages has supplemented the sectorial sub- programmes by enabling transnational cooperation on innovative language learning approaches across several educational sectors (2 as a minimum requirement). It has also mainstreamed international efforts to raise awareness about the importance of acquiring linguistic skills and to boost access to language-learning resources and develop teaching materials, thus reinforcing the continuous integration of language education in lifelong learning policies. Priorities for KA2 have been set annually by the European Commission and the initiative has been open to all public or private organisations or institutions providing learning opportunities to target groups. Implementation of KA2 took place in the following settings: (cid:120) (cid:3) Multilateral Projects (MP) - which promote language awareness and access to language learning resources and develop or spread language learning materials, including online courses and instruments for language testing; (cid:120) (cid:3) Multilateral Networks (NW) - which contribute to promoting language learning and linguistic diversity and support the development of language policies by the exchange of information about innovative examples and tools among decision-makers and education professionals. Furthermore, NW facilitate and enhance European co-operation and promote educational innovation and best practice; (cid:120) (cid:3) Accompanying Measures (AM) - projects developed to promote the objectives and results of languages projects through; communication activities, thematic monitoring, the collection and provision of information on project results as well as dissemination and exploitation of project results. 8 The EU motto: http://europa.eu/about-eu/ ",

        "10 Best Practice Projects under KA2 - Languages This publication contains a collection of best practice projects which started between 2007 and 2013 and were funded under the Lifelong Learning Programme's KA2 - Languages. The projects are divided into seven sections, reflecting the most important priorities 9 and areas of interest under this action. The sections 10 are as follows: 1) Strengthening Social Inclusion through Multilingualism 2) Early Language Learning 3) Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) 4) Special Educational Needs and Language Learning (SEN) 5) Less Widely Used and Taught Languages (LWUTL) 6) ICT and Language Learning 7) Languages and Employability Each section is introduced with an outline of the issue at stake and is followed by a description of EU-funded projects. The projects presented were selected due to their successful implementation and the important contribution they made to their specific field. The activities of these best practice projects have incorporated innovative practices and approaches to language learning, focussed on capacity building and cross national co-operation and involved hundreds of individuals in the process. The impact of the projects has been twofold: (cid:120) (cid:3) Firstly, projects have contributed to piloting innovative ideas and to building knowledge at both an institutional and an individual level. They have also created communities of European stakeholders, improved the exchange of practices and experiences among culturally and professionally diversified actors, thus achieving results that could not have been pursued within national boundaries. As such, the European dimension has been a distinguishing trait in these projects. (cid:120) (cid:3) Secondly, on an individual level, projects have had an impact on the many hundreds of people involved, encouraging cooperation through the focus on tangible common challenges. The impact of these projects at a policy level, however, has been less visible. This aspect is now a clear priority in the new generation of programmes such as Erasmus+. 9 Other priorities and type of projects have been funded under Key Activity 2-Languages. This publication presents a series of very good examples. A selection has been made based of the quality of the projects but others might have been chosen. 10 The way the projects have been grouped under each of the seven sections is linked to the project's main objectives and results. It might also be pertinent to include them under other sections but each project appears only once in this publication. ",
        "11 Erasmus+ and Languages As of 1 st January 2014, a new set of EU programmes for education, training, youth, sport, audiovisual, culture, EU aid volunteers and citizenship were launched. The main actions of the previous programmes; learning mobility, cooperation projects and support for policy reform, continue to be a focus and activities where the systemic impact is strongest and where there is a clear EU added value have been strengthened. The new Erasmus+ programme brings together all EU and international schemes for education, training, youth and sport, replacing the seven existing programmes: the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius and Grundtvig), Youth in Action and five international cooperation programmes (Erasmus Mundus, Tempus, Alfa, Edulink and the programme for cooperation with industrialised countries). This streamlined structure increases efficiency, simplifies application rules and procedures and makes it easier to apply for grants, avoiding duplication and fragmentation. The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is one of the specific objectives of the Erasmus+ Programme. A lack of language competences is one of the key barriers to participation in European education, training and youth programmes. The opportunities put in place to offer linguistic support are aimed at making mobility more efficient and effective and at improving learning performance. Linguistic support is available for the language used by participants for studying, carrying out a traineeship or volunteering abroad in the framework of long-term mobility activities supported under Key Action 1, i.e. mobility periods of two months and longer and mobility periods of one month and longer in the case of VET learners. Linguistic support is mainly offered online as e- learning offers advantages for language learning in terms of access and flexibility. Online support includes the mandatory assessment of language competences and voluntary language courses. Language assessment is a crucial aspect of the initiative in order to provide the right preparation for each participant and to collect evidence about the language skills of EU mobility participants. A language assessment is undertaken by participants before mobility and another assessment is carried out at the end of the mobility period in order to monitor progress in language competences. Under Key Action 2, Strategic Partnerships in the area of language teaching and learning are encouraged. Innovation and good practices aiming to promote language skills can include for example; teaching and assessment methods, the development of pedagogical material, research, computer assisted language learning and entrepreneurial ventures using foreign languages. Furthermore, funding for linguistic support is provided to beneficiaries of Strategic Partnerships who organise long-term training and teaching activities for staff and youth workers. The European Language Label (ELL) award is maintained through the regular (annual or biennial) organisation of national competitions in the participating countries. The ELL award should function as a stimulus to exploit and disseminate the results of excellence in multilingualism and promote public interest in language learning. Under Key Action 3, policy support, it is possible to finance research projects carried out with the Member States within the framework of ET2020, focusing on priorities in the field of language ",
        "12 teaching and learning. One of the priorities that has been defined for the last cycle of ET2020 is inclusive education which captures the current project on language teaching, learning and support in multilingual classrooms. Erasmus+ is based on the premise that investing in education and training is the key to unlocking people's potential, regardless of age or background. It helps those involved to gain new skills, boost their job prospects and develop on a personal level. The benefits for individuals also bring benefits for the EU economy as a whole, as demonstrated in numerous studies and research findings.

        "15 1. (cid:3) Strengthening Social Inclusion through Multilingualism In 2009, nearly 80 million people across the European Union lived below the poverty line, representing 16% of the EU population 11 . The economic crisis has made the situation even more challenging. Children, young people, single parents, households with dependants, people with a migrant background, certain ethnic minorities (such as Roma) and people with disabilities have emerged as particularly exposed to the risk of poverty. The Europe 2020 strategy has laid out a plan for the EU to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy in the coming decade. Two of its targets include fighting poverty and social exclusion in order to have at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion by 2020 12 and to increase the rate of employment to 75% among the population aged between 20-64 years. In addition, promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship is one of the four strategic objectives of the Strategic Framework for European Cooperation in Education and Training (ET2020) 13 . Although Europe 2020 identifies languages as a key success factor for the mobility, employability and personal development of European citizens, multilingualism can also play a key role in enhancing social cohesion, inclusiveness and intercultural dialogue as well as in creating opportunities to discover other values, beliefs and behaviours. As recognised in the European Union Education Ministers Declaration on \"Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education\" of March 2015 14 , it is desirable that humanistic values, social, civic and intercultural competences will be strengthened and will remain at the core of European education systems and European policies in the future. Promoting intercultural dialogue and multilingualism, language teaching and learning and linguistic diversity in Europe has been an overarching aim of the LLP programme and KA2 \u2013 Languages in particular. The annual Call for Proposals 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 even set a specific priority for strengthening social inclusion in Europe through KA2 Languages projects, with an added focus on the integration of migrants and Roma in the Calls between 2011 and 2013. The best practice projects funded under LLP, KA2 \u2013 Languages presented in this chapter focused on the study of inclusive multilingual societies in Europe, promoted intercultural dialogue with respect to migrants and raised awareness of minority European languages such as Romani. The outcomes of these projects show the significant contribution that EU funded projects can make in tackling the current economic and political challenges that the European Union is facing. 11 Eurobarometer survey on Poverty and Social Exclusion 2009: http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&langId=en&pubId=5990&type=2&furtherPubs=yes 12 http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm 13 http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/index_en.htm 14 http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/2015/documents/citizenship-education-declaration_en.pdf ",

It covers the geographical area of Italy, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, due to a recent increase in the arrival of immigrants in most of these countries. The network provides country reports on attitudes towards multilingualism in these regions and information on linguistic policies adopted in each partner country. The network also researches effective ways to promote multilingualism and linguistic diversity. The results are collected in a virtual Study and Documentation Centre about Multilingualism in Mediterranean Europe, available to school authorities, teachers, institutional representatives, NGOs and migrants associations. MERIDIUM has also created a multilingual booklet ( Babel and Languages ) to stimulate children's curiosity towards language diversity through the travel diary of a multilingual alien, Babel. The research results and booklet are available on the project's website. esults: MERIDIUM is a reference point for the scientific community, for institutional agencies at a local and national level, for NGO agencies and migrants associations, and for schools and teachers. The research outcomes have been developed to provide information for decision makers both at national and European level in order to encourage common strategies for targeted actions. The results have reached almost 600 scholarly experts and are useful for the public at large as well as European policymakers. The Study and Documentation Centre helps teachers and school managers to implement intercultural activities in primary school classes, so far reaching 66 schools, a total of 2,300 children and over 1,800 parents. The main outcome is the multilingual booklet, available in six languages: Italian, English, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian and Spanish. The website is accessible in English and Italian.

The project researched the framework of existing European and national policies on multilingualism and proposed areas where this could be strengthened. LE-TPP brought together decision makers and stakeholders in business, education, and government to look at case studies, exchange ideas and consider actions. The project identified key issues, performed online consultations, and developed policy and best practice proposals for sustained dialogue. The LE-TPP Report Languages in Europe: Towards 2020 15 summarises the key issues and proposes further areas for research on the future and impact of multilingualism. LE-TPP has organised three seminars (on social cohesion and languages, intercultural communication, and language policy), an international conference (Unlocking the Gates of Languages 16 ), as well as dissemination activities in Member States and through transnational networks. esults: LE-TPP identifies the conditions that allow good ideas on multilingualism to develop into coherent policy and practice. The project's main outcome is the report outlining the main issues, current good practice, and proposals for future action to overcome obstacles and promote positive conditions where linguistic diversity can flourish. A working group has studied how to facilitate greater synergy between theory, policy and practice, and proposed the establishment of a network of on-going support for multilingual policies within the context of the multilingual city. The LE-TPP website hosts all project documents, conference reports, and speaker contributions as well as student essays on multilingualism, multilingual city features and other contributions to the debate. The wide range of evaluation activities, together with the continuous dissemination and exploitation of the project, demonstrate clear plans for the future. www.letpp.eu 15 http://www.languagescompany.com/ 16 http://www.letpp.eu/conference D R ",

The signs include street signs, graffiti, writings in restaurants and bars, information on buildings and heritage sites, as well as famous and important events and people. The project uses new media and contemporary art and design to create an educational and promotional model. SIGNS has developed linguistic and cultural guides for ten cities, a training kit for city promoters, and a methodology for language promotion via the culture of the city. Alongside this, the project has set up photography exhibitions, produced nine films that capture the look and feel of a given city, and created an interactive game: Signs in the city: Horizons 17 . The game is available in eleven languages, covering three different alphabets. All products are available on the project's website. esults: Building on the previous Signs in the City project, SIGNS transfers and adapts the original model to other learning environments and languages, including regional and minority languages, cross-border regional languages, as well as less widely used and taught languages. The project combines language promotion, tourism, and interest in different cultures and places to convince every citizen that their involvement in the promotion of a city can trigger further interest in its profile and can support the preservation of local identity. The animated computer game provides information about 10 European cities, their culture and history, and shows real and existing places and signs. It contributes to raising awareness of linguistic, cultural and historical diversity in an attractive and interactive way, and is continuously used by education providers in Europe. SIGNS has directly reached more than 50 000 people in over 30 countries, and the website has received over 24 000 hits during the project period, and over 43 000 hits over the project's overall lifespan.

The project first researched the Romani language and the Roma people, producing two reports on Romani language and culture. It has then set up the first Romani multimedia language course, a website, and three cross- content units on Roma and the Romani language to be used in primary education, secondary education and at universities. The Romani multimedia course (level A1-A2) is in the more commonly used variant of Romani, 'Generic' or 'Middle Vlax', and represents Roma culture across Europe. The course caters for Roma adults and young people, as well as education organisations dealing with Roma and the Romani language. The wide use of graphic resources, mainly animations, in the course makes it suitable for those with a lower educational background. esults: ROMANINET has developed a Romani language course and cultural resources available to the Roma community as well as wider society. The multimedia language course is the first of its kind and contains a total of 1500 units of cultural resources which can be used for self-study as well as formal learning. The course follows a Roma couple travelling through different European countries and contains translations into English, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian and Bulgarian of typical Roma situations in these countries. The course is available as a CD-ROM and all products are accessible on the project's website in Romani, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Bulgarian. The website currently has 35500 visits per year, and the web users are mainly Roma, a high percentage of whom come from a low economical and academic background.

        "20 2. (cid:3) Early Language Learning According to the latest research, early childhood education is a vital foundation for educational success later in life, which is why pre-primary education is essential. This applies equally to language learning. Secondary analysis of the data from the European Survey on Language Competences (ESLC) conducted by the JRC\u2019s Centre for Research on Lifelong Learning (CRELL) confirms that, amongst other factors, success in a target language of study is positively influenced by an early start to language learning 18 . The Heads of State of the European Union officially recognised and proclaimed the importance of very early foreign language acquisition at the Barcelona Summit in 2002 19 , calling for further action to \"improve the mastery of basic skills, in particular by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age\". The Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET2020) establishes seven ET2020 European Benchmarks 20 , including one concrete quantitative target related to languages - namely that by 2020 at least 95 % of children aged between 4 years and the age for starting compulsory primary education should participate in early childhood education. The data in the Education and Training Monitor 2014 21 shows that participation in early childhood education and care (ECEC) stands at 93.9%, which is close to the 2020 target of 95%. The report also reveals that \"policy action should better acknowledge the essential role of early childhood education and care (ECEC) in tackling inequalities and raising proficiency in basic competences.\" To support Member States willing to set up or enhance early language learning at national level, the Commission has published an Early Language Learning Policy Handbook 22 derived from the exchanges of experiences of a group of national experts. These guidelines and recommendations provide examples of good practice and academic evidence on how to ensure the quality, effectiveness and sustainability of language learning in pre-primary settings. The purpose of this handbook is to draw attention to the conditions for success \u2014 and potential pitfalls \u2014 of early language learning by furthering the debate and proposing tried and tested solutions. The LLP programme, and Key Activity 2 \u2013 Languages in particular, has fostered early language learning as part of its annual support for projects in the field of multilingualism. The annual call for proposals 2012 even set a specific priority promoting early language education for multilateral projects (priority 2.1.6. of the LLP Call for Proposals 2012). 23 The emphasis of this priority is on connecting main stakeholders involved in early language acquisition (parents, mediators, teachers) in order to strengthen integration between the school and the community. The projects funded under LLP, Key Activity 2 \u2013 Languages focus on raising awareness of the importance of early language learning, especially among parents, and provide methodologies and tools, facilitating the learning process and stimulating the children's interest in learning about other languages and cultures. 18 http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ 19 http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/ (point 44, p. 19) 20 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ (ANNEX I - Reference Levels of European Average Performance (\"European benchmarks\")) 21 http://ec.europa.eu/education/ 22 http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/ 23 http://ec.europa.eu/education/tools/ (p. 39) ",

        "24 3. (cid:3) Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) Content and Language Integrated Learning is an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second). This approach gives students the opportunity to study in at least two languages and to learn the subject and the language at the same time. The methodology used is similar to language immersion and content-based teaching. With CLIL the knowledge of the language becomes the means of learning content. The fact that language is seen in real-life situations and in context can help to increase learners' motivation and to nurture their self-confidence about language learning. CLIL also helps to develop multilingual interests and attitudes. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings 25 . In addition, in its different applications, CLIL has the potential for students to develop transversal and cultural skills, which have been identified as part of the building skills for the 21 st century in the Commission's communication Rethinking Education 26 . The Eurydice report Key Data on Teaching Languages at School in Europe 2012 27 recognises that \"although it exists in nearly all countries at primary and general secondary levels, CLIL is not widespread across education systems\". However, this report also shows that CLIL provision in Europe includes not only foreign languages but also regional and/or minority languages, or even a different state language in countries where several languages are recognised as official. In the Council Resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism 28 , the Heads of State of the European Union invited the Member States and the Commission \"to devote particular attention to further training of language teachers and to enhancing the language competences of teachers in general, in order to promote the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in foreign languages\". Through the LLP programme and its Key Activity 2 \u2013 Languages, the European Commission has funded three best practice projects which have identified relevant conclusions for the teaching practice of CLIL. These projects are presented in detail hereafter. Furthermore, the last Call for Proposals of the LLP Programme in 2013 contained a specific priority in order to support projects related to fully bilingual or partially bilingual (CLIL) education with a special focus on teacher training. As a result, two more projects on CLIL are currently being funded and implemented. Thus, the list of best practice EU-funded projects on CLIL methodology may increase in the near future. 25 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:EN:PDF 26 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012DC0669&from=EN 27 http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/key_data_series/143en.pdf 28 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:320:0001:0003:EN:PDF ",

        "28 4. (cid:3) Special Educational Needs and Language Learning The importance of supporting children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) has been recognised internationally and in Europe a strong political consensus has been reached on the topic of inclusive education for children with SEN. As the concept is becoming increasingly important, the general trend is towards a shift from a medical to a more educational approach to disabilities. 33 Nonetheless, there is no common framework of what exactly special needs in education constitute and how to categorise them, nor is there an agreement on how to tackle SEN challenges in a harmonious way across Europe. Coordination through mutual learning and the sharing of best practice is also not common. 34 In the European Union there are about 45 million citizens of working age with a disability and 15 million children with special educational needs which sometimes deprives them of educational and employment opportunities. 35 For example, dyslexia, which impedes a person\u2019s ability to read, affects approximately 6% of Europe\u2019s population 36 , while the estimated number of deaf and hard of hearing people in the EU is 50 million. 37 2010 statistics 38 show that in the EU there are 754 530 deaf sign language users and, while the officially spoken languages are 24, there are 30 official sign languages in the EU. There are already several initiatives at EU level addressing the topic of special needs in education, most notably the 2009 Education and Training 2020 Strategic Framework (ET 2020) 39 , and the May 2010 Council conclusions on the social dimension of education and training 40 . Both emphasise the importance of inclusive education and personalised learning as a way to achieve equity and social cohesion. \"Inclusive education is not an optional extra; it is a basic necessity\", commented Androulla Vassiliou, former European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth. The needs of children with SEN have most influence on their teachers, trainers and parents. Studies show for example that parents of children with the special needs experience feelings of isolation and high levels of stress. 41 In order to ensure that the educational development of the child does not suffer, both teachers and parents need to be equipped with the proper knowledge, strategy and tools. As the competitiveness and professional prospects of people within the EU are highly affected by their command of foreign languages, the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission, Key Activity 2 \u2013 Languages supports projects providing the resources and tools needed for SEN language learning for both teachers and pupils.

        "32 5. (cid:3) Less Widely Used and Taught Languages The European Union has given the status of 'official languages' within the European institutions to 24 state languages. However, there are numerous regional or minority languages, as well as non-territorial languages, which have official status in some countries. More than 60 indigenous regional and minority languages are spoken regularly by up to 40 million people in the EU. These include languages spoken by a majority in one country but a minority in others, and the languages of minority groups such as Yiddish and Romany. 42 Within the European context, the term Less Widely Used and Taught Languages (LWUTL) covers different categories of languages. These can be small state languages or regional and/or minority languages, which are \"traditionally used within a given territory of a state by nationals of that state who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the state\u2019s population\" 43 . A fundamental document on the subject of LWUTL is the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe. It was adopted as a convention and opened for signature in 1992 and entered into force in 1998, aiming to \"maintain and to develop Europe's cultural traditions and heritage\" and \"respect an inalienable and commonly recognised right to use a regional or minority language in private and public life\" 44 . The European Commission is strongly committed to supporting the linguistic diversity of the European Union. In the 2008 Council Resolutions on a European strategy for multilingualism 45 , the promotion of less widely used European languages is specifically referenced as an important contribution to multilingualism. According to the 2012 Eurydice study, Key Data on Teaching Languages at School in Europe 46 , the most widely used languages of the EU are English, French, German, Spanish and Italian along with Russian. These are also the languages most often included in the school curriculum in formal education. However, regional and minority languages are widely used for CLIL provision (please see Chapter 4 of this brochure). Supporting the learning and use of regional and minority languages has been a strand under LLP and KA2 - Languages. From 2007 to 2013, all the Call for Proposals under the Key Activity 2 - Languages included a priority on LWUTL 47 . This has been done on the assumption that multilingualism should be an asset and not a burden to the European construction. Speaking more than one foreign language and/or a language other than English, French, German or Spanish can enhance citizens' mobility within the EU, attract more job opportunities and possibilities for personal development and increase skills for intercultural understanding. The projects presented in this publication aim to raise awareness and promote the importance of LWUTL, thus preserving linguistic diversity; to facilitate the learning of regional and/or minority languages and support the integration of foreigners in specific regions; and to have an impact on European level by providing policy recommendations. Languages featured in these best practice projects include Slovak, Greek, Estonian, as well as Breton, Occitan, Welsh and Romani. 42 http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/regional-minority-languages_en.htm 43 http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/aboutcharter/default_en.asp 44 http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Summaries/Html/148.htm 45 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008G1216(01)&from=EN 46 http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/key_data_series/143en.pdf 47 http://ec.europa.eu/education/tools/llp_en.htm ",

It stresses the importance of communication in foreign languages and promotes language learning in the context of the European travel and tourism sector, globalisation, open borders, student mobility, and property purchase abroad. The project has developed bilingual language sets in 20 different language versions (Bulgarian-Czech, Lithuanian-Dutch, Czech-Greek, etc.), providing basic skills in the target languages on commonplace travel situations. The bilingual language sets are designed to motivate pupils, students and adults travelling to the target countries to learn the languages. These sets can be used as helpful material for self-study purposes on the road without the use of any transitional languages. The end-users become familiar with the alphabet and numbers in the desired language, as well as picking up basic vocabulary (130 words) which they can use and develop during their visit to the respective country. esults: The project demonstrates an innovative approach to the development of language learning materials for less used languages in the context of tourism and travel. The bilingual language sets supplement the service portfolio of the 25 partner travel agencies by including a language service in addition to their travel services. As well as traditional tourist trips, these travel agencies offer school excursions, work overseas, business trips and travel for students. The language sets are freely downloadable from the project website, which also contains informative links on language, language learning and the culture of the participating countries.

        "41 6. (cid:3) ICT and Language Learning Over the past decades ICT has become an integral part of daily life and, as such, it plays an important role in education and especially in language learning. In the report Key Data on Learning and Innovation through ICT at School in Europe 2011 eLearning has been defined as \"the use of new multimedia technologies and the Internet to improve the quality of learning by facilitating access to resources and services\" 51 . The use of ICT in education can increase students\u2019 motivation by giving the learner more control over the learning experience, while also having a positive impact on attainment. Furthermore, using ICT in the classroom broadens the pedagogical methods open to teachers. Androulla Vassiliou, the former European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, highlighted that ICT \"provides a variety of tools that can open up new possibilities in the classroom\" 52 . The European Commission has integrated the use of ICT in education into its strategy to ensure the effectiveness of European education systems and the competitiveness of the European economy. The eLearning Programme (2004-06) looked at the effective integration of ICT in education and training to improve the quality and accessibility of European education 53 , while the i2010 strategic framework highlighted the need to promote education and training in the use of ICT 54 . In September 2013, the European Commission launched a new initiative through its Opening up education communication which set out \"a European agenda for stimulating high-quality, innovative ways of learning and teaching through new technologies and digital content\". 55 Nonetheless, the results of the European Survey on Language Competences clearly show that, according to students in most regions, ICT is not regularly used during language lessons 56 . It is therefore vital that the European Union has well-trained teachers who are able to incorporate ICT into a more student-centred educational experience. Since 2007, ICT for education has been one of four cross-cutting themes of the Lifelong learning Programme (LLP) 57 and plays a major role in all other themes, including Key Activity 2 - Languages. The projects funded under LLP, Key Activity 2 \u2013 Languages, often involve ICT to a large extent, as this allows the sharing of knowledge, resources and experiences, while nurturing a process of connected and collaborative learning. It facilitates interaction among pupils and encourages partnerships between educational experts and language teaching practitioners, who are able to engage in joint projects and discussions. A further benefit of ICT-based language learning projects is that they are scalable and dissemination can easily be implemented on a transnational level.

        "49 7. (cid:3) Languages and Employability As nations and cultures come together, learning foreign languages is a key element for fostering the employability of individuals in the competitive global labour market. The need for effective communication skills and intercultural competencies in combination with the ability to work in multilingual and multicultural teams is growing. 60 Europe\u2019s vision for 2020 is to become a \"smart, sustainable and inclusive economy\" 61 , as defined in the Europe 2020 Strategy. The Strategic Framework for European Cooperation in Education and Training (ET 2020) 62 , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, calls for action to \"improve the quality and efficiency of education and training\" by matching future skill requirements to labour market needs. Both the 2008 Communication from the Commission Multilingualism: An asset for Europe and a shared commitment 63 and the 2008 Council Resolution European strategy for multilingualism 64 emphasise the link between multilingualism, mobility and employability, highlighting two important factors. On the one hand, learning languages is especially relevant in the context of vocational education and training (VET), which is why \"students in VET should have access to practice-oriented language provision\" 65 . On the other hand, language competencies can help small and medium-sized enterprises to \"broaden their access to markets\" 66 . Since the launch of the LLP, one of the strategic priorities under KA2 - Languages has been cooperation between the worlds of education, training and work. This priority seeks to support projects aimed at reinforcing language competences relevant to the workplace in order to improve employability of the European citizens and enhance European competitiveness. Projects in this area focus on: labour-related language learning for migrants; language skills in specific sectors such as ICT or tourism; world languages with important trade partners such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian; recognition and matching of competences for employability; intercultural communication for businesses and many more. 60 http://ec.europa.eu/languages/library/documents/languages-for-jobs-report_en.pdf 61 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:2020:FIN:EN:PDF 62 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52009XG0528(01)&from=EN 63 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:ef0003 64 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32008G1216(01) 65 See footnote nr. 62 66 See footnote nr. 63 ",
