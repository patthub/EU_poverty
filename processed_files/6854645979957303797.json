        "T R A I N I N G NEW SKILLS SWEDEN Sweden is using ESF funding to achieve its aim of full employment and a more cohesive society. Education and training initiatives are helping disadvantaged groups, such as the low-qualifi ed, to obtain skills and get into jobs. Sweden is also helping employers and workers to acquire the modern skills and competences they need to ensure sustainable growth in the future. THE ESF IN SWEDEN: SOME EXAMPLES A factory for work opportunities In \u00c5m\u00e5l, \u2018Work Factory\u2019 was a successful project for getting young unemployed people into work, further studies or training. It targeted youngsters between the ages of 16 and 25 on state welfare or municipal support. Participants took part in various training exercises for a three-month period, learning important skills. These included writing a CV and cover letter, interview techniques, improving their self esteem, health and fi tness exercises and visits to companies and schools. The success rate was high, reaching approximately 60 %. Of these, 38 % found work, 13 % started studying and 8 % received vocational training. Training better nurses The \u2018Kravm\u00e4rkt yrkesroll\u2019 project developed in-service training for health-care staff to develop skills and improve quality assurance. It addressed the needs of nursing staff based on the new demands in the work place, fi rst seen with the rising numbers of elderly patients and cases of dementia. Marie Ardstr\u00f6m, the manager of \u2018Kravm\u00e4rkt yrkesroll\u2019 , explains: \u201cThere was a gap between what the students learned on the health- care programme at their upper secondary school and the skills actually needed for geriatric care. It is easy to forget how much responsibility this occupational group has \u2013 a mistake made when medication is given can have dire consequences.\u201d Do you want to\u2026? \u2026learn more about the ESF in Sweden? \u2026understand better how the ESF works? \u2026see video clips on projects from across the EU?

        "M I C R O - F I N A N C E NET WOR KING Sweden is recovering well from the economic crisis and is making full employment its goal. The Swedish government considers that jobs are fundamental to well-being \u2013 providing wealth, a sense of belonging and the oppor- tunity for people to chart their own lives. Furthermore, as the lack of a job is seen as the primary reason for social exclusion, Sweden\u2019s determination to boost employment is also the key weapon for reducing poverty, ensuring fair chances for everyone, and building a more cohesive society. To achieve this goal, it is responding to a number of chal- lenges on the path to full employment. One of these is the need to improve the job pros- pects of young people who leave school with few or no qualifi cations. It is this group that is benefi ting least from the recovering employ- ment rate, and this is o(cid:18) en particularly true for young people with recent immigrant back- grounds. Furthermore, an increasing number of Swedish companies across all sectors are reporting diffi culties in recruiting the qualifi ed staff they need to meet demand \u2013 so educa- tion and vocational training must be rein- forced to off er workers the skills they need to participate and benefi t from economic growth. Long-term unemployment is an important problem among older people, immigrants, disabled people and the low-qualifi ed, so eff orts are needed to bring these groups into the labour market and give them the tools to avoid the trap of poverty and social exclu- sion. Sweden has adopted a Roma strategy extending from 2012 to 2032. The overall goal of the Swedish Roma strategy is that a Roma who turns 20 years of age in 2032 should have the same opportunities in life as a non-Roma. ESF spending in Sweden For 2007-2013, Sweden is receiving EUR 691 million in ESF funding. With national co-funding, this brings the total ESF spending on jobs to over EUR 1.3 billion. ESF programme spending priorities are focused on education and training to provide more people with the chance to fi nd employment, and to give them the skills and qualifi cations they need to keep their job or get the new job they want. INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND JOBS: THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SWEDEN Fair access to jobs Already, over 700 ESF supported projects have been launched to help people facing particular obstacles to work to fi nd a job and participate more in society. The aim is to support over 75 000 such people with training opportunities, counselling and guid- ance. One example is the \u2018New City\u2019 project in Malm\u00f6 that uses personal coaching to help unemployed young people to fi nd a job and integrate better \u2013 it aims to support some 900 young people, and 450 have already found work. Likewise, Sk\u00e5ne County off ered training and company internships to young unemployed people with the result that over 60 % went on to jobs or further training. This initiative proved so successful that it has been copied by other municipalities. The \u2018Mellanspr\u00e5nget\u2019 project in G\u00f6teborg focused on coaching, training and counselling for people with learning diffi culties to help them fi nd suitable jobs with the co-operation of local businesses. And for recent immigrants, in the \u2018Jobs Point West \u00d6rebro\u2019 project a local housing association helped its unem- ployed tenants to fi nd the training, language skills and job contacts they needed \u2013 over 240 tenants took part and more than half went on to work or further training. Better job skills, better business ESF projects are encouraging employers and entrepreneurs to help their workers get the better skills they need to improve perfor- mance, adaptability and job prospects. Over 1 200 projects for training and improving skills have been granted funding \u2013 and the aim is to off er such opportunities to 240 000 women and men. An example is a project in Nybro to give local retailers new marketing and manage- ment skills to improve their performance. And in Stockholm, a training programme developed by the Corporate Academy helped compa- nies develop export plans and fi nd suitable business partners in Portugal to boost their exports. For the public sector, which is facing a loss of valuable experience as many staff approach retirement, the \u2018Competence Bridge\u2019 project used networking, benchmarking and competence development, among other tech- niques, to build the skills and aspirations of young people for work in public administra- tion across eight municipalities. And for small enterprises of up to nine people, a popular project in Stockholm off ered low-cost courses in leadership, communications and marketing to owners and employees \u2013 over 2 200 took part, including many women and immigrant entrepreneurs.
