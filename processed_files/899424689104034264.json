MIEL PARTNERS THE EUROPEAN UNION INVESTS IN OUR REGIONS Regional and urban policymakers have countless and varied tasks to encourage innovation, reduce carbon emissions, support small and medium-sized enterprises, optimise urban development, promote social inclusion and cooperation, improve trans- port, manage natural disasters\u2026 One of their key priorities is to promote economic development and to bring regions and citizens closer together. Because a(cid:2)er all, solidarity makes for a stronger Union!

        "THE REGIONS BRING US CLOSER TOGE THER T he regions are the wealth of Europe: a mosaic of cultures, languages and diversity. An exceptional framework where our lives together change day a(cid:4)er day. However, it is clear that the European regions do not all boast the same assets. There are many \u2013 sometimes considerable \u2013 differences between the regions, for example in terms of job creation, economic growth, quality of life and sustainable development. The task of regional and urban policymakers is to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union by reducing differences in standards of living through the transfer of know-how, by fostering human capital and promoting trans-border cooperation etc. The least prosperous regions of the European Union benefit from valuable investments through projects relating to infrastructure, research and innovation and energy efficiency. The funds invested in these least-developed regions are powerful solidarity instruments. Moreover, they are beneficial to companies in countries with more advanced economies, which can export their know-how or merchandise to these less-developed regions. The goal of this policy is anything but abstract, namely to invest in the regions in order to improve the living and working conditions of citizens. The six stories in this album illustrate the aim of regional and urban policy. These titbits of life and stories of men and women were inspired by real, specific projects that contributed to improving the quality of life of countless European citizens. Day in, day out these projects directly or indirectly benefit each and every one of us. 3 ",

        "Oh, mum! What a nice surprise! I hope the trip wasn\u2019t too long. It\u2019s quite an ordeal coming here\u2026 Three hours by bus. And we live five hundred metres from each other\u2026 Crazy isn\u2019t it?! I came to visit Cl\u00e9mentine. We talked on the phone\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m sure. But well, at her age I guess she has better things to do than to spend time with her old grandmother\u2026 Don\u2019t be silly. She adores you and you know that! Anyway, soon, when they open the bridge and the new road, seeing each other will become much easier\u2026 What a pity, she\u2019s not home! Are you sure you didn\u2019t get the day wrong? 8 ",

It would be a shame not to! Yessssss!!!! 10 ",

I\u2019m going to study law! I want to become a lawyer. That\u2019s great news! I suppose you\u2019re enrolling at the university of Cayenne? Yes You look gorgeous! Let\u2019s take it! 12 ",

        "A FEW DAYS LATER That will inspire Alessandra for sure! Why did you pick up that piece of wood? I\u2019m sending it to my friend in Italy. She can make a nice sculpture out of it. I\u2019m going to put my house up for sale and move to Cayenne. I have some friends in the city and there\u2019s always something to do there. So when you go back to school, you\u2019ll have a place to stay, in my apartment\u2026 What do you think?? Grandma\u2019s here! Yay! 14 ",

In the thirties this factory was the beating heart of the region\u2019s economy. It was abandoned for four decades, partially destroyed by an earthquake and then rebuilt thanks to the European Union\u2019s Solidarity Fund. Now we can write a new chapter in its history.

Yes, and we\u2019re audited by an independent body. Can I order a tonne and a half of peaches, apricots and plums to be delivered in the next two months Your asparagus is delicious! Are all your products certified as organic? 18 ",
        "Hi Aniello! How are you? You seem a bit tense\u2026 What is she doing? She\u2019s crazy! I nearly crashed into a woman\u2019s car in front of the car park\u2026 Completely nuts! A brunette, quite cute actually\u2026 Do you know her? I\u2019ve seen her around. Her project is similar to yours I think. She\u2019s setting up a network of local organic vegetable distributors. Anyhow, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be buddies anytime soon! 19 ",
        "So, how did it go? Does it look like your producer can be trusted? Definitely. On another note, I just ran into an idiot while driving into the car park\u2026 He nearly crashed into my car. A tall, thin guy\u2026 I see\u2026 And quite good- looking too?\u2026 He\u2019s in our field: he sells local fruit and vegetables online. He\u2019d better not step on our toes, that one!

And sparkling water please. So the same as this gentleman? Hmmm\u2026 Apparently, yes. Buon appetito, signorina! 22 ",
        "I see we\u2019re dealing with the same producers\u2026 Having car trouble miss? Need a hand? My first project wasn\u2019t much of a success. But I\u2019ve learnt from my mistakes. Fare Impresa is a great new opportunity for me. Same here. I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge. But working with other young entrepreneurs creates some healthy competition. So I decided to go for it! 23 ",
        "In some ways yes\u2026 But you\u2019re more into \u2018each man for himself\u2019, no? If your car hadn\u2019t broken down, you\u2019d still be giving me the silent treatment\u2026 I suppose you\u2019re right\u2026 I\u2019m not that easy- going after all, but we\u2019re competitors, aren\u2019t we? Not entirely\u2026 I had a look at your website\u2026 Our projects complement each other well. We shouldn\u2019t be competing... Why don\u2019t we join forces instead of simply working side by side? I looked into the European funds we could benefit from, and the ERDF seems like a safe bet\u2026 Let\u2019s make a toast, as business managers, to the success of our respective projects! Let\u2019s shake on it What are you sculpting? A small mermaid\u2026 A friend sent me a piece of wood from French Guiana\u2026 Fruit and vegetables are quite compatible indeed\u2026 And taking part in Erasmus+ for Young Entrepreneurs has pushed me into trying out new ideas\u2026 24 ",

He\u2019s ready to see you. Let me show you to his office. I\u2019m going that way. What do you do? I\u2019m a researcher. I studied molecular biology at the university that founded our Centre. Thanks to the European research network I was able to gain experience abroad. What about you? Let me call him. My story is similar to yours. First I worked in Germany, then a local private lab, Nanomo, recruited me. Like you, we conduct cancer research. 29 ",

Alessandra is so sweet. We receive financial support from the European Union - through our region - to develop our research activities.

Thanks to you I can do part of my consultations from home, in the countryside, via the computer. Teleconsultation is what they call it. That way, I can avoid travelling too often. I also reconnected with some childhood friends. They\u2019ve created a cross-community association called \u2018Local Stories\u2019 with the financial support of the European Union. They organise presentations on local history while cooking their garden produce. They asked me to go and speak about my hobby and the history of the region\u2019s rail network.

        "TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT In the story \u2018SOS\u2019, the rescue boat aboard which Lisak works in the Baltic Sea sails past a wind farm. The use of renewable energies, which are more environmentally friendly, is one of the priorities of regional policy to fulfil the European Union\u2019s environmental goals. The environment can generate economic growth by encouraging the development of innovative clean technologies, by promoting rational energy usage, by stimulating eco- tourism and by increasing the attraction of certain areas by protecting their natural habitats (1) . TO BOOST RESEARCH AND INNOVATION The two characters in the story \u2018Promises\u2019, researchers Cecylia and Dawid, are passionate about their job. However, in this field sometimes passion is not enough. Generally, the investments required in medicine are very high. The sustainability of economic growth is increasingly dependent on the capacity of regional economies to change and innovate. This means that more efforts are needed to create an environment that fosters research and development (R&D), as well as innovation (2) . TO SUPPORT SMALL AND MEDIUM(cid:2)SIZED ENTERPRISES Small and medium-sized enterprises drive the European economy. These dynamic businesses are essential to economic development and job creation. However, when transforming a good idea into a profitable and sustainable concept, major difficulties sometimes throw a spanner in the works: lack of financing, infrastructure problems etc. Through their support to business incubators, regional policymakers help entrepreneurs like Alessandra and Aniello in the story \u2018Local networks\u2019 transform good ideas into successful businesses (3) . TO FOSTER URBAN DEVELOPMENT More than two-thirds of the EU population lives in urban areas, and this trend continues to grow. That\u2019s why urban development (economic, social and environmental) was put at the heart of the European Union\u2019s regional policy. A healthy environment is a source of well-being for all citizens. However, some urban areas are neglected, like the neighbourhood where Carlos and Adriana live in the story \u2018Music, maestro!\u2019, which leads to the social exclusion of their inhabitants. Regional policymakers help the national authorities invest in the renovation of these neighbourhoods and the set-up of facilities for all their inhabitants (4) .

        "TO PROMOTE SOCIAL INCLUSION One of the European Union\u2019s fundamental goals is to promote the social inclusion of all its citizens, particularly those who are marginalised by society. Several projects financed by regional policy aim to contribute to this (5) . In \u2018Figures\u2019 Gary learns about the European Union\u2019s support and integration measures for underprivileged groups through the participation of elderly people in local social support networks. TO STRENGTHEN COOPERATION Regional policy aims to bring together all the relevant brainstorming efforts as well as resources, skills and solutions. The collaboration between Finnish and Estonian rescuers in the story \u2018SOS\u2019 illustrates the added value of common approaches and actions. Neighbouring cross-border regions are confronted with the same problems and tackling them together strengthens them both (6) . TO IMPROVE TRANSPORT LINKS The lack of efficient public transport links and infrastructure seriously hampers the development of isolated regions and territories. In the story \u2018Reunited again\u2019 Cl\u00e9mentine and her grandmother need to spend hours on the bus to meet up or to go to the city. A bridge linking the two river banks or a new road would improve daily life for all the inhabitants of the area. Transport infrastructure is one of the most tangible examples of the support that the European Union\u2019s regional policy can provide (7) . TO MANAGE NATURAL DISASTERS No region is immune from large-scale natural disasters such as floods, forest fires, earthquakes, storms and drought. To assist regions affected by natural disasters, like Calabria in the story \u2018Local networks\u2019, the European Union set up the Solidarity Fund in 2002. This Fund helps the affected country recover the expenses made to take all the necessary urgency measures: the restoration of infrastructure and equipment, temporary accommodation for displaced persons, deployment of emergency services etc. 6 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/cooperate/index_en.cfm 8 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/thefunds/solidarity/index_en.cfm 67 ",
        "1) The budget of the European Union\u2019s regional policy is decided upon jointly by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament on the basis of a proposal by the European Com- mission. All Member States contribute* to the EU budget, a third of which goes to finance cohesion policy. All regions receive funds based on their lev- el of wealth. 2) The regional policy principles and priorities are established jointly by the European Parliament, the European Commission and the 28 Member States. The regional and local authorities, as well as organisations representing employers, employ- ees and civil society, are also consulted. 8) The programme officials closely monitor the progress of the actions and the financed projects, and draw up regular reports for the European Com- mission. The Commission monitors the implemen- tation and gradually transfers the European funds. It also encourages the exchange of experiences through multiple networks. 7) A project may only be financed by the Europe- an Union if it also receives public funds from the Member States and/or funds from private inves- tors. FROM BUDGE TS (cid:2) The European Union\u2019s regional policy is an investment policy which contributes to the development of the regions through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF). (cid:2) Regional policy is jointly managed by the European Commission, the Member States and the regions. (cid:2) (cid:2) 68 ",
        "3) Each Member State draws up a dra(cid:4) partner- ship agreement describing the priorities in terms of development. This document includes a list of action programmes aimed at the entire country or a specific region. There are also cooperation programmes aimed at cross-border regions. 4) The European Commission and the national authorities decide upon the priorities of each pro- gramme. 6) The Member States and the regions are responsible for the management and implemen- tation of the programmes. This involves selecting, following-up and evaluating hundreds of thou- sands of project proposals made by small and medium-sized enterprises, public bodies, univer- sities, associations, Non-governmental organisa- tions and volunteer organisations. 5) The Commission adopts the partnership agree- ment and the programmes to be launched on the field. The Commission then provides the Member States with an advance on the funds to enable them to launch the envisaged projects. TO PROJEC TS (cid:2) The Member States and their regions choose the pro- jects that will be co-financed by the European Union, under programmes scheduled in advance with the European Commission.

        "FIND OUT MORE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL AND INVESTMENT FUNDS? The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aims to strength- en economic and social cohesion in the European Union by correcting imbalances in economic development between its regions. The Cohesion Fund (CF) helps Member States whose gross national product (GNP) per capita is below 90% of the EU average in the promotion of sustainable development, particularly in the areas of transport and environmental protection. The European Social Fund (ESF) invests in people in order to improve access to the labour market and training opportunities in the Mem- ber States. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) aims to improve the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, and the quality of life in rural areas, preserve the environment, and encour- age diversity in the economic activities of rural areas. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) aims to help fishermen in the transition to sustainable fishing, support coastal communities in diversifying their economies, finance projects that create new jobs, improve the quality of life and make it easier to access financing. These five funds* have one common goal, namely to jointly support the Europe 2020 objectives by gen- erating sustainable growth and quality jobs, by combatting climate change and energy dependency, and by reducing poverty and social exclusion. WHO ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THESE FUNDS? The beneficiaries of these five funds may be public bodies, certain private-sector organisations (particu- larly small and medium-sized enterprises), universities, associations, NGOs and volunteer organisations. IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER The European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was set up to respond to major natural disasters and express European solidarity to disas- ter-stricken regions within Europe. * http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/thefunds/index_en.cfm 70 ",
