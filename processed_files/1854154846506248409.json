        "In January 2002 the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) beca- me an autonomous Paris-based agency of the European Union. Following an EU Council Joint Action of 20 July 2001, it is now an integral part of the new structures that will support the further development of the CFSP/ESDP. The Institute\u2019s core mission is to provide analyses and recommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulation of the European security and defence policy. In carrying out that mission, it also acts as an interface between European experts and decision-makers at all levels. Chaillot Papers are monographs on topical questions written either by a member of the ISS research team or by outside authors chosen and commissioned by the Institute. Early drafts are normally discussed at a semi- nar or study group of experts convened by the Institute and publication indicates that the paper is considered by the ISS as a useful and authoritative contribution to the debate on CFSP/ESDP. Responsibility for the views expressed in them lies exclusively with authors.

A la veille de la r\u00e9union de New York en septembre 2005, l\u2019Institut a voulu dresser un bilan le plus complet et le plus critique possible des dif- f\u00e9rentes options sur la table. Sous la responsabilit\u00e9 de Martin Ortega, responsable \u00e0 l\u2019Institut des \u00e9tudes sur le Moyen-Orient et le droit interna- tional, cinq des meilleurs experts des Nations unies examinent, dans ce Cahier de Chaillot , les possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9formes susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre port\u00e9es par l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne.

Mais le d\u00e9bat fondamental est avant tout politique. Les Nations unies sont-elles un instrument au service d\u2019un groupe de pays, fussent-ils les plus d\u00e9mocratiques de la plan\u00e8te, avec pour mission premi\u00e8re celle d\u2019ex- clure/contourner/punir les Etats qui ne respecteraient pas les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles ? Ou doivent-elles au contraire maintenir co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte une voca- tion universelle, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019inclusion syst\u00e9matique de tous les Etats, y compris les perturbateurs, afin de contraindre chacun au respect minimal des r\u00e8gles collectives du syst\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 international ? Leur objectif majeur est-il de pr\u00e9venir la prolif\u00e9ration des armes de destruction massive et le terrorisme, ou doivent-elles d\u00e9velopper une conception plus large et plus complexe de la paix internationale ?

        "Foreword Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations In December 2003, the European Union took a significant step towards articulating a vision of its role and responsibility in build- ing a better world. The European Security Strategy, \u2018A secure Europe in a better world\u2019, presents a compelling argument for an international order based on effective multilateralism. It sets out the components of this as a stronger international society, well functioning international institutions and a rule-based interna- tional order. And it powerfully reaffirms the EU\u2019s commitment to strengthening the United Nations, and to equipping it to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively. The EU as an international institution possesses a unique capacity to realise this commitment across a broad range of dimensions \u2013 political, economic, military and social. Most recently, it has developed capacities to support the UN in its efforts to help countries emerge from conflict and make the long and difficult journey to a secure peace. This support is needed. Global peacekeeping demands continue to increase and regional partners can make a vital contribution to international efforts to address the rise in conflict. According to the Stockholm Interna- tional Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the total number of UN and UN-sanctioned regional organisations\u2019 peace operations under way by the end of 2004 was the highest in the last decade, with the brief exception of 1999. These operations range in scale and complexity to an unprecedented degree, from observer to robust peacekeeping, to complex peacebuilding and long-term institution building. The current surge has stretched the UN\u2019s existing peacekeep- ing capacities to their limits. Since the beginning of 2004, five complex operations have been either newly mandated and deployed or significantly expanded. UN peacekeeping has grown from some 30,000 uniformed and civilian personnel deployed in 2000 to nearly 80,000 personnel currently deployed in 18 peace- keeping and related field operations led by my department, the 7 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 7 ",
        "Department for Peacekeeping Operations. To grasp the scale of this activity consider some of the numbers involved: 120,000 troops were rotated in 2004, 580,000 passengers flown and half a million tonnes of freight delivered \u2013 all this managed by a head- quarters with a ratio of 1 staff member to every 115 in the field. Regional and international organisations such as the EU, NATO and the AU are also confronting similar challenges in meet- ing the operational demands of their engagement in peace opera- tions, either UN or UN-sanctioned. The personnel, materiel and logistics requirements to launch and sustain this increased activ- ity weighs at least as heavily on regional organisations, none of which has the long experience and global reach of the UN in peace- keeping. It is not a question of either UN or regional peacekeeping: the issue is how we can best work together in effective multilater- alism to advance the cause of peace and global security. The EU\u2019s eight crisis management operations to date have demonstrated the potential and the range of multilateral cooper- ation in peacekeeping. The EU\u2019s first crisis management opera- tion, the 2003 EU Police Mission (EUPM) in Bosnia and Herze- govina represented a transition from the seven-year UN mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH). In similar fashion, the EU\u2019s military Operation Althea succeeded the NATO SFOR operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 2004. The EU\u2019s commit- ment to peace and stability in its neighbourhood is further demonstrated in the ongoing police and rule of law operations in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Georgia respec- tively. The EU\u2019s first foray outside Europe, Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the summer of 2003, was a rapid military deployment in support of the UN mission in that country, MONUC. Another dimension of EU-UN coopera- tion within MONUC is the current EU police mission in DRC, EUPOL Kinshasa, which is directed at a specific functional task in the DRC capital. In Iraq, meanwhile, civilian EU and UN missions work alongside each other in support of UN resolutions to assist the Iraqi people rebuild their country. The 24 September 2003 Joint Declaration on EU-UN coopera- tion in crisis management provided the framework for regular joint consultation between the two organisations. These have in turn facilitated the EU\u2019s drafting of documents that elaborate modalities for provision of military and civilian capabilities to UN peacekeeping. No less important is continued cooperation 8 Foreword cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 8 ",
        "between the UN and the European Commission, not just in Kosovo, where the EC leads UNMIK\u2019s activities in economic reconstruction, but in providing resources for peacebuilding tasks outside Europe such as in Haiti, DRC and West Africa. We have, therefore, set out on the journey towards effective multilateralism in international peacekeeping. The question now is how do we chart a steady course to get there? I believe that the starting point \u2013 our guiding star, so to speak \u2013 is recognition that effective multilateralism builds on legitimacy . What this means, as the report of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change indicated, is that UN Security Council authorisation should ideally be sought for any operation carried out by regional organisations. This recommendation in fact goes beyond the Charter, which only requires authorisation for forceful action. The international legitimacy that UN Security Council authorisa- tion confers on a peace operation is indivisible, but it is not static. Effective multilateralism requires meaningful and consistent communication between the UN and the regional organisation engaged in a peace operation, a principle reflected in Article 54 of the UN Charter, throughout the course of an operation. A second, related, principle for effective multilateralism in peacekeeping is a shared commitment to qualitative standards of peacekeeping . The quality of the human resources we deploy to mis- sions is essential because the environments in which peacekeeping takes place are difficult and often dangerous, and because the peacekeeping tasks that we are requested to carry out are increas- ingly complex. With well-trained and interoperable military and civilian personnel we can rise to these challenges. The EU can play a valuable role in helping to raise the quality of international peacekeeping personnel. EU-UN cooperation has already pro- duced results in terms of the elaboration of EU training standards and modules, and participation of UN personnel in EU training courses. Here I believe there is a particular capacity for the EU and its member states to contribute to the spread of international peacekeeping standards by extending military and civilian train- ing courses and initiatives to interested non-EU member states. Quality extends to personal conduct. The legitimacy of inter- national peacekeeping is directly related to the conduct and actions of the men and women who carry it out. Where individual conduct and actions fail to meet the standards set by the UN, we all fail. UN member states must assert and enforce UN standards of 9 Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 9 ",
        "conduct among their contributing troops and civilian personnel, and the EU can play a useful role in facilitating this effort. The third step toward effective multilateralism in interna- tional peacekeeping is to develop the capabilities to respond strongly and swiftly. In terms of military capabilities, the biggest weakness of international peacekeeping today is our lack of depth. The UN\u2019s lack of a reserve to react robustly and respond to threats to fragile peace processes in complex environments threatens the progress already accomplished on the ground in our missions. For this reason, the Secretary-General has proposed a \u2018Strategic Reserve\u2019 concept. Under this, the UN would establish a small num- ber of task forces/battalions of forces trained, equipped and avail- able for deployment to a UN operation at short notice. These would be made up of troops from member states, earmarked for that purpose and taken out of their regular duties for rotation periods of up to 12 months to form an element of the Strategic Reserve. Once deployed to a mission, these forces would operate under UN command and control. There is significant potential for linkage, I believe, between the UN Strategic Reserve and the EU\u2019s \u2018battle group\u2019 concept. The 13 battle groups which the EU intends to develop have the potential to contribute substantially to the UN Strategic Reserve capacity, particularly in niche capabilities such as strategic airlift, commu- nications and evacuations. However, the envisaged length of deployment of EU battle groups is very short: the potential, there- fore, of EU battle groups to make the transition to Blue Helmets at the end of an EU deployment may merit consideration. It is important to reiterate that EU military capacity for crisis management is a complement, not a replacement, to member states\u2019 national commitments to UN peacekeeping. We would strongly encourage renewed commitment in terms of contribu- tion of uniformed personnel. Today, European representation \u2013 once a major element of our global deployment \u2013 represents only 6.7 per cent of police, military and observer personnel in UN oper- ations worldwide, and only 2.3 per cent of deployment in Africa. The provision of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping by EU member states represents a crucial practical asset, since they are amongst the best trained and prepared in the world. It also sends a powerful message as to the depth of EU member states\u2019 commit- ment to effective multilateralism and their willingness to share the responsibilities, as well as the rewards, of collective security. 10 Foreword cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 10 ",
        "We have raised this with the Permanent Missions of EU member states in New York and will continue to do so. At the same time, we welcome the supplementary efforts of the EU institutions to encourage such participation, including through the EU\u2019s \u2018clear- ing house\u2019 function. One capacity area in which the EU has a unique role to play is in the non-military dimensions of complex peacekeeping. These have expanded exponentially in the last decade and include civil- ian specialist activity in fields such as police, rule of law and tran- sitional justice, security sector reform, human rights, disarma- ment, demobilisation and reintegration, civil administration, economic reconstruction and institution building. The EU has gone further than many organisations in targeting capacity build- ing in this broad range of activities. The civilian dimension of peacekeeping represents an important area for cooperation between the UN and the EU in terms of recruiting and swiftly deploying required personnel expertise to international peace operations. One particular aspect of this is potential cooperation in the establishment of a UN Standing Civilian Police Capacity proposed by the Secretary-General in follow-up to a recommenda- tion of the High-Level Panel. A pilot capacity of 25 full-time, field- based police specialists would be set up in the UN to provide assis- tance with rapid deployment and early mission start-up, with the goal of expanding to 100 based on experience and needs. Active engagement between this capacity and the EU\u2019s police capacity, which includes a small Police Unit in the Council of the European Union, would be desirable. Beyond the specific area of police, there is significant opportunity for the UN and EU to work together in developing doctrines and concepts of operation for civilian ele- ments of peacekeeping, particularly in the rule of law, and in work- ing to ensure the integration of development perspectives into post-conflict peacebuilding. The integration of Europe has been a work in progress for over 50 years. This process has brought peace, stability and wealth to the Continent and offers a symbol for other parts of the world of the potential benefits of regional cooperation. Strong and effec- tive regional bodies could reinforce the pillars of the international system, which is built, as the European Security Strategy asserts, on the fundamental framework of the United Nations and its Charter. Such regional bodies could give real meaning to its Chap- ter VIII. What the consolidation of regions must not do is put fur- 11 Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 11 ",
        "ther pressures on global fragmenting tendencies along lines of wealth, religion or resources. Effective multilateralism is about uniting diverse countries and peoples, and the organisations that represent them, in common, concrete projects. It is in the pursuit of this that EU-UN cooperation finds its legitimacy and its effec- tiveness. In its document outlining the modalities for EU-UN coopera- tion in military crisis management operations (of June 2004) the EU emphasised that, in order for our two organisations to work better together, we needed in-depth knowledge of each other. To this end, it suggested the potential of the EU Institute for Security Studies to carry out possible supporting work. I would like to commend the Institute for responding with alacrity and initiative to this idea and look forward to its continued work on EU-UN cooperation. 12 Foreword cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 12 ",
        "Introduction Martin ortega In a famous speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 23 September 2003, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched a reflection process on the future of the organisation. He pointed out: . . . we have come to a fork in the road. This may be a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded. At that time, a group of far-sighted leaders, led and inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, were determined to make the second half of the twentieth century different from the first half. They saw that the human race had only one world to live in, and that unless it managed its affairs prudently, all human beings may perish. So they drew up rules to govern international behaviour, and founded a network of institutions, with the United Nations at its centre, in which the peoples of the world could work together for the common good. Now we must decide whether it is possible to continue on the basis agreed then, or whether radical changes are needed. In order to analyse the challenges that the UN was confronting, as well as the changes needed, the Secretary-General convened three groups of eminent personalities to give their views on (a) the role of civil society in global governance, (b) security threats and UN insti- tutional reform, and (c) development and poverty. The three panels delivered their reports, respectively entitled \u2018We the peoples: civil society, the United Nations and global governance\u2019 (June 2004), \u2018A more secure world: our shared responsibility\u2019 (December 2004) and \u2018Investing in development: a practical plan to achieve the Millen- nium development goals\u2019 (January 2005). On the basis of those reports, Kofi Annan presented his own recommendations regard- ing changes in the UN, in the document \u2018In larger freedom \u2013 towards development, security and human rights for all\u2019, dated 21 March 2005. In June this year, the incumbent president of the Gen- eral Assembly, following consultations with UN member states, 13 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 13 ",
        "prepared a draft list of issues drawing from the Secretary-General\u2019s document. The member states of the United Nations will examine these and other proposals for UN action and reform during the next General Assembly, which will celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the organisation, starting in New York in September 2005. Through a parallel development, the European Union has been defining its role on the global scene in the last couple of years. In 2003 the European Council decided to undertake Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the first EU-led mili- tary operation outside the European continent, and tasked Javier Solana to draft a final version of the European Security Strategy in June 2003. On 24 September 2003, the EU and the UN signed a joint declaration on cooperation in civilian and military crisis manage- ment, and in December 2003 the European Council adopted the European Security Strategy. In this document, the EU member states declare: In a world of global threats, global markets and global media, our security and prosperity increasingly depend on an effective mul- tilateral system. The development of a stronger international society, well functioning international institutions and a rule- based international order is our objective . . . The fundamental framework for international relations is the United Nations Charter . . . Strengthening the United Nations, equipping it to ful- fil its responsibilities and to act effectively, is a European priority. In May 2004, the EU \u2013 now enlarged to 25 member states \u2013 sub- mitted a contribution to the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Chal- lenges and Change. Finally, the draft Constitutional Treaty, approved in June 2004 and signed on 29 October 2004, described the guiding principles of the EU\u2019s foreign and security policy, and affirmed explicitly (Art. III-292) that: The Union\u2019s action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibil- ity of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. 14 Introduction cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 14 ",
        "The Union shall seek to develop relations and build partnerships with third countries, and international, regional or global organ- isations which share the principles referred to in the first sub- paragraph. It shall promote multilateral solutions to common problems, in particular in the framework of the United Nations. The EU is therefore committed to working hand in hand with the United Nations. However, although practical EU-UN coopera- tion on peacekeeping, development assistance and other issues is well on track, the appropriate synergy between the EU and the UN regarding UN reform has not been arrived at during the last two years. It can be argued that the EU and its member states have had no impact on the preparatory work for UN reform because this reform is both too much and too soon for them. Despite fact that there were British and French members of the High-Level Panel, or that the EU presented a fourteen-page contribution to the High-Level Panel, it appears that the Europeans (who pay around 40 per cent of the UN budget) have \u2018punched below their weight\u2019 during the preparation of the forthcoming negotiation. UN reform has been too much for the EU and its member states because such reform is an intricate undertaking that encompasses a whole range of complex, intertwined global issues. Despite its his- torical significance, UN reform has not received sufficient public or political attention in Europe. And it has been too soon because the EU is still searching its own international role vis-\u00e0-vis its member states, on the one hand, and vis-\u00e0-vis other states and actors, on the other. The draft Constitutional Treaty was a valid means for resolv- ing this kind of soul-searching impasse, but the debacle of the French and Dutch referendums casts many doubts on its ratifica- tion. As a matter of fact, UN reform equally is too much for other gov- ernments across the world \u2013 not just Europeans. The \u2018far-sighted\u2019 spirit of the UN founding fathers, as Kofi Annan put it, stands in stark contrast to the short-sighted preoccupations of most of the current political leaders. And yet, improving global governance is an urgent need. Extreme poverty, global warming, protection of the environment, respect for human rights and dignity, scarcity of resources, pandemics, conflict resolution, collective security and peacekeeping, as much as non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism, are global challenges that affect us all and call for immediate, concerted action.

        "gle state nor a group of states, however powerful they are, can tackle those challenges alone. As pointed out in the European Security Strategy, multilateral responses are ineluctable and the United Nations must naturally be at the centre of international efforts to deal with global challenges. Reinforcing the United Nations and making it more effective is the only way to advance towards a more secure and peaceful world. This Chaillot Paper offers some ideas on how the EU and its mem- ber states can contribute to UN reform. The Institute organised a seminar in Paris under the title \u2018The EU and the United Nations: implementing effective multilateralism\u2019 on 21 March 2005. After the seminar, the Institute asked five participants to write on the fol- lowing subjects: security and development (Sven Biscop), human rights and protection of the environment (Francesco Francioni), peacekeeping (Thierry Tardy), UN Security Council reform (Jeffrey Laurenti), and regional organisations and collective security (Kennedy Graham, who writes with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio). A conclusion draws some lessons from the various chapters and suggests that the EU should be more involved in the UN reform process. This publication is inspired by two main assumptions. First, the United Nations should be utilised not only for fighting against global threats but also for realising global opportunities. As a con- sequence, UN reform is not solely a \u2018defensive\u2019 enterprise (i.e. better protecting ourselves through joint action) but also a \u2018creative\u2019 undertaking (i.e. working to attain common goals, such as develop- ment, protection of the environment and human rights). Second, the EU and its member states share a balanced vision on global issues, as clearly stated in both the European Security Strategy and the draft Constitutional Treaty. They should be consistent with the principles and values they proclaim and participate more actively in this unique opportunity to reinforce the United Nations. 16 Introduction cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 16 ",
        "Security and development: a positive agenda for a global EU-UN partnership Sven Biscop As the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change rightly indicated in its substantive report on UN reform, the legit- imacy of the collective security system of the UN depends on its ability to address everybody\u2019s primary concerns. 1 The system can- not function if major concerns of specific countries or of a specific nature are felt to be systematically ignored. The Panel therefore called for a new security consensus and identified six clusters of security threats to be dealt with by the system \u2013 later underwritten by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his March 2005 report: 2 (cid:90) economic and social threats, including poverty, infectious dis- eases and environmental degradation; (cid:90) interstate conflict; (cid:90) internal conflict, including civil war, genocide and other large- scale atrocities; (cid:90) nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons; (cid:90) terrorism; (cid:90) transnational organised crime. The Panel and the Secretary-General thus clearly advocate a comprehensive approach, seemingly recognising the links between social and economic, politico-military and other factors; the Panel\u2019s report states that the primary objective must be pre- vention, which begins with development. Yet, is it really helpful to label all of these challenges as security threats? Although it might raise their importance in the eyes of states, it also blurs the distinctions between policy areas. Poverty or HIV/AIDS are problems of a different nature than terrorism, proliferation or conflict: they do not imply a threat of violence and cannot be tackled by politico-military means. Rather, social, economic and other factors constitute the background to, and the root causes of, specific politico-military threats. The neces- sarily comprehensive nature of the collective agenda can be 17 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism 1.

Understanding the challenge: Global Public Goods The concept of Global Public Goods (GPG) emerged in the context of the UN at the end of the 1990s. GPG are usually seen in the con- text of development, but currently the concept is also being used in more general political terms, as a way of conceptualising the com- prehensive approach to global policy issues (e.g. by Joseph Nye). 3 General speaking, public goods are characterised by non-rivalry in consumption and non-excludability. 4 Global Public Goods pro- vide benefits that are \u2018quasi-universal in terms of countries (cover- ing more than one group of countries), people (accruing to several, preferably all, population groups), and generations (extending to both current and future generations, or at least meeting the needs of current generations without foreclosing development options for future generations)\u2019. 5 Global Public Goods can be grouped under four broad head- ings, which can be associated to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s defi- nition of \u2018larger freedom\u2019: (cid:90) physical security and stability \u2013 \u2018freedom from fear\u2019; (cid:90) political participation and an enforceable legal order that guar- antees the human rights and equality of all; (cid:90) an open and inclusive economic order that provides for the wealth of everyone \u2013 \u2018freedom from want\u2019; (cid:90) social wellbeing in all of its aspects \u2013 access to health services, to education, to a clean environment. These are the core GPG to which every individual is entitled; in that sense, they are universal public goods. 6 As in the \u2018human secu- rity\u2019 approach, the individual is the point of reference. GPG are strongly interrelated: ultimately, one cannot be ensured or enjoyed without access to the other; the four categories are there- fore equally important. In the words of the Secretary-General: \u2018Accordingly, we will not enjoy development without security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.\u2019 Effective global gover- nance means ensuring access to GPG; a system that fails to provide the core GPG lacks legitimacy.

        "1 security of all states, depends on the availability of sufficient access to the core GPG. Rather than terrorism, WMD or other military threats, the most important \u2018threat\u2019 is the ever growing gap between haves and have-nots, a gap which can be best expressed in terms of access to the essential GPG. While this gap and the feelings of exclusion, marginalisation and frustration resulting from it certainly do not justify conflict, they do help to explain it, which is a prerequisite for prevention and resolution of conflicts. The gap between haves and have-nots is foremost among the challenges of the globalised world, because it is a threat of a systemic nature, i.e. it results from, and impacts on, the functioning of the global order itself. Unless mechanisms of governance are created or rendered more effective that can alleviate this situation, at a certain level of inequality, the resulting political upheaval, extremisms of all kinds, economic uncertainty and massive migration flows will become uncontrol- lable. Since it denies access to core GPG to a large share of the world\u2019s population, the status quo is not an option. Against this background, specific politico-military threats do indeed stand out. They include regions of chronic tension and long-standing disputes and conflicts, failed states and civil wars, proliferation of WMD and excessive militarisation, and terrorism. These challenges directly threaten people, states and regions. They have to be tackled head-on, but as they are symptoms of the \u2018dark side of globalisation\u2019, effective global governance and improving access to GPG, must be pursued at the same time as the key to pre- venting such threats. \u2018Security is the precondition of development\u2019, the European Security Strategy states, but this works the other way around as well, as indicated by the Secretary-General. Of course, the strength of the causal relationship between, on the one hand, the gap between haves and have-nots in the broadest sense and, on the other, specific politico-military issues, differs from case to case. None the less, in the long term no durable settlement of such issues can be achieved unless the stability of the world sys- tem itself is assured. Meeting the challenge: a positive and integrative agenda The keyword in a policy based on the notion of GPG is integration . Because the core GPG are inextricably linked together, action must 19 Sven Biscop cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 19 ",
        "1 be undertaken simultaneously and in a coordinated fashion by all relevant actors in all fields of external policy, putting to use the vari- ous instruments at their disposal, including trade, development, the environment, police, intelligence and legal cooperation, diplomacy and security and defence. As is highlighted in the Secretary-Gen- eral\u2019s report, both the recommendations of the High-Level Panel and the Sachs Report on development 7 thus constitute a single agenda. However, although policies in all of these fields must be inte- grated under the same overall objective of increasing access to GPG, each should continue to operate according to its own rationale and dynamic. \u2018Securitisation\u2019 (i.e. the instrumentalisation of non-mili- tary dimensions of external policy as a function only of \u2018hard\u2019 secu- rity concerns) must be avoided, for it ignores the intrinsic impor- tance of the other GPG. Accordingly, rather than all challenges being included under the label of security, issues must not be dealt with as security threats unless they pose an effective threat of violence. By thus addressing the root causes of conflict, a policy oriented on the core GPG emphasises structural conflict prevention . This pres- ents a formidable challenge: it implies dealing with more issues, related to all the core GPG, at an earlier stage, before they become security threats. Effective prevention is much more than mere appeasement: it demands a proactive stance, aiming to change cir- cumstances that induce instability and conflict. Mark Duffield analyses how structural prevention in effect amounts to the \u2018merg- ing of development and security\u2019: \u2018[Development] is no longer concerned with promoting economic growth in the hope that development will follow. Today it is better described as an attempt, preferably through cooperative partnership arrangements, to change whole societies and the behaviour and attitudes of people within them.\u2019 8 In this broad sense, development \u2018not only leads to the reduction of poverty, more political freedom, and greater affir- mation of human rights, but also lays the foundation for more durable peace and security.\u2019 9 In the terms of the European Com- mission, \u2018the EU will treat security and development as comple- mentary agendas, with the common aim of creating a secure envi- ronment and of breaking the vicious circle of poverty, war, environmental degradation and failing economic, social and political structures.\u2019 10 A policy oriented on GPG should in fact be quite intrusive, which might make it rather contentious with the target countries. 11 But bearing in mind that pursuing GPG is in the mutual interest of all concerned, it is at the same time a very 20 Security and development: a positive agenda for a global EU-UN partnership 7.

        "1 positive approach, contrary to other, threat-based strategies. \u2018For whom\u2019 rather than \u2018against whom\u2019 is the question that would determine policy based on Global Public Goods. The sincere pur- suit of GPG will bring greatly enhanced legitimacy. As Nye advises the United States: \u2018We gain doubly from such a strategy: from the public goods themselves, and from the way they legitimize our power in the eyes of others.\u2019 12 As effective action in all policy fields concerned requires the cooperation of a wide range of actors at many different levels, a GPG-oriented policy implies multilateralism : an intricate web of states, regimes, treaties and organisations, i.e. multilevel gover- nance, implicating all levels of authority in a coordinated effort to improve people\u2019s access to GPG. States are crucial actors in this respect. Although in the notion of \u2018human security\u2019 the individual is taken as point of reference, the state indeed remains a primary partner, for no effective arrangements can be made with weak and failed states. In the words of the Secretary-General: \u2018Sovereign states are the basic and indispensable building-blocks of the inter- national system . . . Therefore, one of the great challenges of the new millennium is to ensure that all states are strong enough to meet the many challenges they face.\u2019 For the EU, this means that third states must therefore be seen as partners for cooperation rather than as mere subjects of EU policies; the aim is to influence rather than to coerce, to use the carrot rather than the stick. There will be cases where the use of force is inevitable, for not all actors are amenable to preventive initiatives. But in the framework of multi- lateralism, the use of force can only be a measure of last resort man- dated by the Security Council. In those cases, the legitimacy acquired through the pursuit of GPG can be capitalised upon. Both the approaches recommended by the Secretary-General and advocated in the European Security Strategy contain many elements of a strategy based on GPG. 13 Although the notion is not mentioned in the European Security Strategy, its implicit presence is evident: \u2018Spreading good governance, supporting social and political reform, dealing with corruption and abuse of power, establishing the rule of law and protecting human rights are the best means of strengthening the international order.\u2019 Likewise, in the objectives of EU external action as formulated in the draft Constitutional Treaty (Art. III-292) additional emphasis is placed on aspects of global governance such as sustainable economic, social and environmental development, the eradication of 21 Sven Biscop 12.

And in one of its recent communications on development, the Commission explicitly mentions the provision of \u2018universal public goods\u2019 as a basic fac- tor. 14 Furthermore, since the Iraq crisis and throughout the debate on the reform of the UN, the EU as such has emerged as one of the leading proponents of the revitalisation of the UN. The EU and the UN are thus evident partners for a comprehensive approach to global challenges. Forging integration at the country-specific level: the Peace- building Commission An important new body to increase coordination between actors and policy fields is the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), a recom- mendation of the High-Level Panel included in the Secretary-Gen- eral\u2019s report. In the post-conflict phase, on a country-by-country basis the PBC would provide a forum for all the actors involved \u2018to share information . . . in the interest of greater coherence\u2019: the dif- ferent UN bodies, the international financial institutions (IFIs), the major bilateral donors and troop contributors, relevant regional actors and the national or transitional government. The PBC should remedy the absence of a body in the UN system to help countries in transition from conflict to lasting peace, and should avoid weak local authorities becoming \u2018overwhelmed by a multi- plicity of conflicting external demands from well-wishers, as each aid agency and NGO seeks to fit the recipient government into its own programmes and procedures\u2019. 15 The emphasis would be on building strong local institutions. Contrary to the original recommendations by the High-Level Panel, which also saw a preventive role for the PBC, according to the Secretary-General it should not have an early warning or mon- itoring function \u2013 the post-conflict phase would be its exclusive remit. Yet, structural conflict prevention entails exactly the same problem of coordination between the multitude of multilateral and bilateral actors. The UN has set up mechanisms to address this problem, such as the UN Framework Team for Coordination on Conflict Prevention, which was created in 1995 and on a monthly basis brings together 23 UN actors, including inter alia DPA, DPKO, UNDP, UNHCR, FAO, ILO, the World Bank and the 22 Security and development: a positive agenda for a global EU-UN partnership 14. \u2018Speeding up Progress to- wards the Millennium Develop- ment Goals.

Building on existing structures, such as the UN Common Country Analyses, and maintaining close contacts with the UN Country Teams in the countries which it addresses, the Frame- work Team\u2019s function is on a country-by-country basis to link up headquarters and agencies in the field, and to channel early warn- ing information and suggestions for preventive action to the appropriate body; it is not itself an implementing body. This working method seems very similar to that imagined for the PBC. Although the Framework Team would retain its useful- ness as a body for intra-UN coordination, the PBC by addressing also structural prevention would enhance the potential for coor- dination in this field too by bringing the bilateral donors and the regional and local authorities to the table as well. A further argu- ment in favour of extending the PBC\u2019s mandate to structural pre- vention is that in fact the types of actions undertaken in the pre- vention and post-conflict phases are often the same, notably building strong local institutions able to provide for citizens\u2019 access to the core GPG. In the immediate aftermath of war, the focus is indeed on preventing the re-eruption of conflict. 16 The Secretary-General recommends that the PBC, which would be assisted by a Peacebuilding Support Office in the UN Secretariat, should permanently comprise a subset of members of the UNSC and ECOSOC, the leading troop contributors and the main donors to a standing fund for peacebuilding, and the IFIs, while the major bilateral donors/troop contributors and the regional and local authorities would be involved on a country-spe- cific basis. Through its participation, the UNSC would be able to complete the data on which to found its decisions with the social and economic dimension which is now often under-represented. Apparently, in the Secretary-General\u2019s view, the PBC on a country- by-country basis would report to the UNSC, i.e. in the immediate post-conflict phase, and, when the UNSC decides no longer to remain seized of the matter, to ECOSOC, i.e. with regard to the longer-term peacebuilding efforts. The Secretary-General stresses that ECOSOC should both \u2018institutionalize its work in post-con- flict management by working with the proposed Peacebuilding Commission\u2019 and \u2018reinforce its links with the Security Council in order to promote structural prevention\u2019. If it were to be added to the tasks of the PBC, structural prevention too would be a matter for reporting to ECOSOC, while the UNSC would be able to seize the matter in the event of a crisis requiring politico-military inter- 23 Sven Biscop 16.

        "1 vention. In order to make optimal use of the aggregate informa- tion it will be able to acquire, the PBC itself should also be able to bring to the attention of the UNSC any situation it judges to require intervention. In view of its collective political and economic weight, and of the establishment of a CFSP, it is advisable that the EU as such would be among the \u2018standing members\u2019 of the PBC, in addition to a range of individual EU member states, in order to contribute in a coherent way its expertise and assets in many different rele- vant fields. This concerns inter alia development and the military and civilian ESDP missions, including in the field of the rule of law, an area specifically mentioned by the Secretary-General for inclusion in the PBC, as well as in the field of security sector reform, a new area for the EU. An issue meriting particular atten- tion is the exchange of information on specific countries. Like the UN, the EU collects a wide range of country-specific data. The Commission\u2019s Conflict Prevention and Crisis Management Unit assesses the conflict indicators in the Country Strategy Papers, for which the Commission Delegations in the field are a vital source of information, and in close cooperation with the Council Secre- tariat and the Joint Situation Centre provides a watch list of potential crisis states. 17 The watch list is confidential, but in the framework of EU participation in the PBC an arrangement should be found that allows for the complete sharing of all information available, in order to ensure its optimal use. Ideally, joint action plans integrating different actors\u2019 programmes for specific coun- tries should eventually be drawn up. Forging integration at the global level: ECOSOC ECOSOC would have an important role with regard to the new PBC, but that role risks remaining empty if ECOSOC itself is not rendered more effective. As it is, ECOSOC \u2018has been too often rele- gated to the margins of global economic and social governance\u2019, as the Secretary-General diplomatically words its current lack of influence. 18 Similarly to the country-specific level, at the global level as well there is a need for coordination between the wide range of actors and policy fields related to development in the broadest sense, in order to address a number of structural issues. While the UNSC is 24 Security and development: a positive agenda for a global EU-UN partnership 17.

        "1 responsible for maintaining peace and security \u2013 \u2018freedom from fear\u2019 \u2013 ECOSOC could be the forum that provides coordination of social and economic development. More specifically, as the Secre- tary-General recommends, and building on the existing annual high-level meetings with the trade and financial institutions, ECOSOC should hold an annual ministerial-level assessment of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The individual states\u2019 current reporting obligations should then be included in this ECOSOC framework, as well as an assessment of the impact of the policies of the IFIs and other actors on the MDGs, in order to avoid contradictory policy objectives and nega- tive side effects. ECOSOC has positive experiences with the establishment of country-specific working groups, but as far as structural preven- tion and post-conflict activities are concerned, this level should be completely transferred to the PBC if this body materialises. ECOSOC should, however, be able to have timely meetings as required, as the Secretary-General advocates, in order to provide coordination in crisis management at a regional or country-spe- cific level in case of crises that are not dealt with by the UNSC, such as famine, epidemics, natural disasters and financial crises. Analo- gous to the relation between the UNSC and the PBC, once the sit- uation is stabilised ECOSOC could if necessary delegate the issue to the PBC for the country-specific coordination of the required long-term activities. Both the MDG review mechanism and the crisis management role require an enhanced profile for ECOSOC and its resolutions. Although, unlike the UNSC, ECOSOC cannot have binding powers, its resolutions should be given due attention by all the actors con- cerned. The ministerial level of the review mechanism should pro- vide for enhanced projection of ECOSOC resolutions, as would a more systematic reporting mechanism on the follow-up given to those resolutions. Finally, \u2018an Executive Committee with a regionally balanced composition\u2019, as proposed by the Secretary-General, would enable ECOSOC to interact in a flexible manner with other actors. Human rights and democracy: a missing link? The Secretary-General recommends the creation of a Human Rights Council to replace the Commission on Human Rights on a 25 Sven Biscop cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 25 ",
        "1 par with the UNSC and a reinforced ECOSOC. Three councils would thus deal with the core GPG: the UNSC with \u2018freedom from fear\u2019, ECOSOC with \u2018freedom from want\u2019 and social wellbeing, and the Human Rights Council with respect to human rights. Perhaps the question should be asked whether this does not leave the issue of political participation and democratisation unaddressed. The Secretary-General does recommend the cre- ation of a democracy fund to help countries seeking to establish or strengthen their democracy, as well as the forging of a closer link between the good governance work of UNDP and DPA\u2019s Electoral Assistance Programme. And of course building or strengthening democratic structures will be part of the programme in those countries where the PBC is active. There are, however, a large num- ber of states with different degrees of authoritarian government; often repression of legitimate political opposition combined with the unwillingness and/or inability to provide citizens with the core public goods provokes radicalisation and extremism \u2013 in many cases, this eventually results in conflict. Such states are mostly very suspicious of external involvement, although a variety of actors attempt to implement programmes for the promotion of human rights and democracy and \u2018positive conditionality\u2019, with limited success. Here, too, there is a problem of coordination between actors. The Mediterranean region can serve as an example of both the lack of coordination \u2013 the EU and the United States run parallel programmes, for instance \u2013 and the lack of success \u2013 after 10 years, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership has not resulted in major progress towards human rights and democracy. One can easily imagine that greater coordination between the dif- ferent actors involved would at least increase the chances of progress being achieved. This is a very sensitive area for the UN, because Art. 2.7 of the Charter firmly excludes intervention \u2018in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State\u2019. Yet perhaps in this area a UN forum for the sharing of information and the comparative evaluation of strategies for pro- moting democracy could be envisaged. The EU contribution The EU has a lot to contribute to \u2018the three councils\u2019 in terms of expertise and capabilities.

The EU has also started to create partnerships with specific programmes and agencies, such as with UNDP (28 June 2004), focusing on governance, conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction, with particular atten- tion to countries that emerge from conflict, and with the ILO (19 July 2004), in the field of poverty reduction and improvement of labour conditions in developing countries. These partnerships and contacts can be intensified in the future, through EU-UN coopera- tion on the priorities identified by the PBC \u2013 which will require the necessary manpower to be made available in the EU institutions. The EU would also have to increase its internal coordination within the different UN bodies where it is represented directly or through its member states. This is particularly true of the UNSC: since the Iraq crisis there has been a greater willingness on the part of the member states holding a seat to have substantial briefings at 25, including on forthcoming debates and draft resolutions, but coherence could be enhanced by aligning the work of the Political and Security Committee more with the agenda of the UNSC, so as to allow for \u2018real-time\u2019 interaction between Brussels and delega- tions in New York. It is often forgotten, however, that EU coordi- nation with regard to the executive boards of the UN specialised agencies is much more limited: only recently have \u2018information rounds\u2019 prior to sessions been introduced and then only for the New York-based agencies. In the IFIs as well, as the Commission recommends, the visibility and influence of the EU could be increased if it spoke more often with a single voice. 19 Finally, the EU (and the member states) should also enhance coordination between its representations in the different UN and international bodies, agencies and programmes, including the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO \u2013 all too often, European delegations to differ- ent organisations spread contradictory messages. Within the EU itself as well, the many different dimensions of external action can still be better aligned. If within the CFSP the integration of the civil and military dimensions is progressing, coordination with trade and development is much less developed. The Commission has recommended ways of increasing coher- ence, 20 but obviously different EU actors, even within the same pil- lar, often still follow different approaches. For instance, the Com- 27 Sven Biscop 19. \u2018Accelerating Progress to- wards Attaining the Millennium Development Goals \u2013 Financing for Development and Aid Effec- tiveness\u2019, COM(2005), 134 final, 12 April 2005. 20.

        "1 mission, in the framework of development, recommends that the EU must seek to avoid increasing political conditionality, while at the same time \u2018positive conditionality\u2019 is the cornerstone of the Neighbourhood Policy. The projected European External Action Service and other provisions of the draft Constitutional Treaty would have been vital for the effective coordination and integra- tion of all dimensions of EU external action. Similarly, coordina- tion between action undertaken by the EU and that by individual member states should be reinforced. In order to implement an integrated, GPG-oriented approach, the EU would also have to adapt part of its policies. It is all too eas- ily forgotten that although the EU is widely seen as a proponent of multilateralism, 21 in the South the EU\u2019s image is often that of an aggressive economic actor, quite the opposite of the \u2018benign\u2019 per- ception that the EU has of itself. Correcting that image requires an earnest effort on the part of the EU to take into account the South\u2019s access to GPG. Through its development policy the EU is already heavily committed to the MDGs, but more fundamental changes in EU policy, notably with regard to trade, will be needed in order to create an economic order that is truly inclusive and to effectively combat poverty. For, as the UN Secretary-General notes: \u2018At present, developing countries are often denied a level playing field to compete in international trade because rich coun- tries use a variety of tariffs, quotas and subsidies to restrict access to their own markets and shelter their own producers.\u2019 The Com- mission itself states this quite frankly: \u2018In the long term, what we are talking about is controlling globalization through public pol- icy in the interests of a more just world order.\u2019 22 This will require substantial efforts on the part of the EU, such as opening up its agricultural market and halting the dumping of subsidised agri- cultural products on the world market. Another aspect is debt relief, also called for by the Secretary-General: debt relief is a way of empowering governments, e.g. in the countries addressed by the PBC; empowerment must of course be linked to accountability. In sum, the EU should consider more seriously the recommenda- tions made in the report \u2018Investing in development\u2019 presented by Jeffrey Sachs in January 2005. Achieving the long-standing target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance is an impor- tant part of this effort, and the EU and its member states should continue along that path.

This is a variant of the Tobin Tax, the original proposal to impose a tax of 0.1 to 0.5 per cent on all speculative currency transactions. Since it is almost impossible to distinguish speculation from regular transactions, however, the Tobin Tax would have to apply to all transactions and would thus have a paralysing effect on the financial markets. The Spahn vari- ant proposes a more practicable, two-step approach: a general tax of 0.02 per cent, sufficiently low not to disturb the markets, would be imposed on all currency transactions; but if a currency were to move outside certain predetermined borders, a heavy tax of 80 per cent would apply in order to stop speculation and avoid financial crises and the disastrous socio-economic consequences that they entail. The tax would thus bring a double benefit: the general tax would generate an estimated \u20ac 50 billion, a structural source of funds for reconstruction and development in less developed coun- tries, while the prohibitive 80 per cent tax would have a stabilising effect on the financial markets. 24 The advantages to be gained through all of these efforts work both ways, for promoting citizens\u2019 access to GPG in the South implies firstly raising their standard of living and setting minimal norms for wages and social security, and secondly, closing the wealth gap reduces instability and threats. Conclusion The EU and the UN share the same basic comprehensive approach that integrates security and development, or in other words, that starts from the assumption that the inextricable link between the core GPG should determine policy. In order to truly implement such an integrated approach, however, both organisations will have to continue reforming their institutions and policies \u2013 their efforts to that end can and should be mutually reinforcing. The opportunity offered by the September 2005 summit must be grasped to introduce a number of reforms in the UN system. Even if decisions are not taken on all aspects of the comprehensive set of recommendations by the Secretary-General, progress should still be possible on specific issues, such as notably the PBC, a body which if all participants earnestly commit to it would be 29 Sven Biscop 23.

A truly integrated approach requires a revitalised ECOSOC \u2013 again, reform should certainly be feasible, but the UN member states should finally decide whether they want ECOSOC to play a role in global governance or not. The EU, at the same time as supporting the all too necessary reforms of the UN, should make sure that its own house is in order, proceeding with the coordination and integration of the different dimensions of external action and increasing its role within the UN \u2013 proving that, in the words of the Commission, 25 it can act as a \u2018front-runner\u2019. More specifically, the EU should promote policies that ensure better access to Global Public Goods (physical security, political participation, development, health services, education and clean environment) for everyone, including trade policies and assis- tance, in line with the declared principles and values that under- pin the EU\u2019s relations with rest of the world. 30 Security and development: a positive agenda for a global EU-UN partnership 25. \u2018The European Union and the United Nations: The Choice of Multilateralism\u2019, COM(2003), 526 final, 10 September 2003. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 30 ",
        "The role of the EU in promoting reform of the UN in the field of human rights and environmental protection Francesco Francioni 1 In 2005 the UN is facing the challenge of its most far-reaching reform since its birth in 1945. Diplomatic efforts and attention by the media have focused especially upon the controversial issue of Security Council reform and its enlargement to better reflect the power and responsibilities of UN membership in the twenty-first century. This theme was high on the UN agenda in the 1990s but consensus eluded the General Assembly as to whether to proceed to the simple addition of a certain number of new permanent members or to adopt a more flexible formula involving rotation amongst semi-permanent members on the basis of geographic representation. Less momentous institutional reform is also called for with regard to the ineffective functioning of the Eco- nomic and Social Council, the Secretariat structure, peacekeeping and the possible elimination or transformation of obsolete bodies such as the Trusteeship Council and the Military Staff Committee contemplated by Art. 47. 2 The need for UN reform has been dra- matically brought to light by a chain of events that have con- tributed to the marginalisation of the organisation and dealt a blow to multilateralism. Since the decision taken by NATO coun- tries in 1999 to use military force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without Security Council authorisation, more radical forms of \u2018unilateralism\u2019, most notably the US-led war against Iraq and the subsequent and continuing occupation of the country, have signalled a marked drifting away from multilateral institu- tions. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the role that the EU can play in responding to the present crisis and in promoting reform of UN law and institutions with respect to two distinct subjects falling within the organisation\u2019s competence: respect of human rights and environmental protection. Paradoxically, these two sub- jects reveal an inverted order of precedence in the relations between the EU and the UN. Human rights were the early product of the UN and its original commitment to rebuild the basis of civilisation dev- 31 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism 1.

In the EU, instead, human rights were the late product of a complex process of eco- nomic integration, and their formalisation in ad hoc legal instru- ments \u2013 although prepared with intense jurisprudential contribu- tion by the European Court of Justice \u2013 did not take place until the 2000 Nice Charter of Rights and the 2004 Constitutional Treaty. 3 On the contrary, environmental protection did not figure in the original UN Charter scheme and it is still mainly entrusted to an institutionally weak \u2018programme\u2019 \u2013 the UN Environment Pro- gramme (UNEP) \u2013 while in the EU environmental protection has become entrenched in the principles and purposes of the Union and has become a necessary dimension of all the other policies. Human rights Protection of human rights represents one of the fundamental principles and purposes of the UN. After reaffirming in the Pre- amble the \u2018faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women\u2019, the Charter proclaim at its Art. 1 that one of the purposes of the United Nations, besides the maintenance of peace and of friendly relations among nations, is the promotion and encour- agement of \u2018 . . . respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\u2019. 4 The record of the UN in carrying out this commitment, although inspired by a cautious and gradual approach, is impres- sive. The establishment of the Commission of Human Rights and the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration placed human rights and the safeguarding of the human person at the centre of the UN agenda. Subsequent adoption of binding human rights treaties progressively introduced the revolutionary concept that states have international obligations towards one another with regard to the treatment accorded to their own citizens, thus removing the subject from the traditional \u2018shelter\u2019 of domestic jurisdiction/ domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 . Human rights supervisory bodies composed of independent experts have been established to moni- tor the implementation of major UN treaties. 5 The International Court of Justice and the UN International Law Commission have both recognised that human rights form an integral part of the 32 Human rights and environmental protection 3. Human rights were rather the competence of the Council of Eu- rope with the adoption in 1950 of the European Convention on Hu- man Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( CETS no. 005), which later became the parameter of ref- erence of the European Court of Justice to review the legality of Community acts or of members states\u2019 implementing legislation deemed to violate fundamental rights. 4. See also Art. 55, which, as part of international economic and so- cial cooperation , engages the UN to promote: \u2018(c) universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.\u2019 5. Supervisory bodies in the form of human rights committees have been established in connection with: (1) the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (999 UNTS 171); (2) the 1966 Covenant on Eco- nomic, Social and Cultural Rights (993 UNTS 3); (3) the 1966 Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (660 UNTS 195); (4) the 1979 Convention on the Elim- ination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1249 UNTS 13); (5) the 1984 Convention Against Tor- ture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or De- grading Treatment or Punishment (1465 UNTS 85); and (6) the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (1577 UNTS 3).

        "2 general interest of humanity and create obligations that states owe to the international community as a whole . 6 These are remarkable results, if one considers the difficulties of the Cold War, the trans- formation of the international community as a result of decoloni- sation, and the ongoing controversy as to whether human rights are the ideological imposition of the Western world (in the sense of European and/or American) rather than a sincere concern for the defence of our shared humanity. So, can we say that the picture looks bright for the future of the UN human rights system? Not quite. The report issued by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Chal- lenges and Change has already identified one major institutional flaw in the functioning and increasing bureaucratisation of the Commission on Human Rights. The report is correct on this point. It is hardly contestable that, despite the commendable record achieved in the early period of its life, when it pioneered the drafting and adoption of the \u2018International Bill of Rights\u2019, 7 and when it later responded to gross violations of human rights by developing new procedures to deal with individual countries 8 or special \u2018themes\u2019, 9 the main UN body has declined in influence and credibility. The reasons are manifold, but two can be singled out as having special relevance. The first relates to the loss of the original human rights \u2018ethos\u2019, inspired by leading founding figures such as Franklin D. Roo- sevelt and Ren\u00e9 Cassin, and the drift towards a body more con- cerned with the defence of member states\u2019 sovereignty than with the cause of human rights. In recent years, membership of the Commission has included states with very poor human rights record. In 2003, among widespread criticism, Libya was elected to the chair of the Commission, thus showing that geographic repre- sentation in the UN was more important than genuine commit- ment to freedom and human rights. Today, among the 53 mem- bers of the Commission we can find countries which are far from having a good human rights record, such as Saudi Arabia and China. But the extreme case is Sudan, a member of the Commis- sion which has been the focus of international attention for possi- ble commission of acts of genocide and which, at any rate, was found to be implicated in atrocities and mass killings by the ad hoc Commission nominated by the UN Secretary-General in 2004. 10 It is no wonder that, given these precedents, the High-Level Panel Report arrived at the following dispirited conclusions: 33 Francesco Francioni 6. See in particular the judgments of the ICJ in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited (ICJ Reports, 1970, pp. 226 ff.) and the recent Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construc- tion of a Wall in the Occupied Palestin- ian Territories (available at <http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ idocket/imwp0/imwpframe. htm>) built by Israel in the occu- pied territories. 7. With this expression we com- monly refer to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (G. A. Res. 217 A (III) of 10 December 1948) and the two 1966 UN Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (see note 5 above). 8. See especially Resolution 1503- XL VIII of 27 May 1970 of ECOSOC which authorised the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and protection of Minorities (a subsidiary organ of the Commission which has now changed its name to Sub-Commis- sion for the Promotion and Protec- tion of Human Rights) to examine communications received by the Secretary-General alleging viola- tions of human rights of a gravity and scale to reveal the existence of \u2018gross violations\u2019. Once estab- lished the reliable character of the communication, the Sub-Com- mission would make a report thus opening the way to in-depth inves- tigation by the Commission and possible recommendation and ac- tion by ECOSOC and even by the General assembly. The procedure laid down by Resolution 1503 has been used to denounce gross vio- lations of human rights and to call upon states to put a stop to them inter alia in relation to apartheid in South Africa, human rights viola- tions in the Arab territories occu- pied by Israel, Cambodia, Equato- rial Guinea, Chile, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Iran and Cuba. 9. The \u2018thematic approach\u2019 in- volved addressing specific human rights violations which had ac- quired a systematic character in certain countries, such as, for ex- ample, enforced or involuntary disappearances in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s (see Commission on Human Rights Res. 20(XXXVI) of 1980, extended cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:33 Page 33 ",
        "2 the Commission\u2019s capacity to perform [its] tasks has been undermined by eroding credibility and professionalism. Stan- dard-setting to reinforce human rights cannot be performed by States that lack a demonstrated commitment to their promo- tion and protection. We are concerned that in recent years States have sought membership of the Commission not to strengthen human rights but to protect themselves against criticism or to criticize others. The Commission cannot be credible if it is seen to be maintaining double standards in addressing human rights concerns. 11 The second reason for the declining role of the Commission on Human Rights is the increasing responsibility assumed directly by the Security Council or the General Assembly in relation to spe- cific situations presenting a pattern of serious breaches of human rights and the concomitant rise of prominence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Examples of this trend can be found, as far as the Security Council is concerned, in its direct involvement in Kosovo, by way of Resolution 1244, and later in the Darfur crisis, by way of Resolutions 1564 and 1593, and, as far as the General Assembly is concerned, in its active involvement in the issue of the Israeli construction of the wall in the occupied Arab territories, which led to the 2004 Advisory Opinion by the International Court of Justice. Against this complex background of shifting patterns of human rights competences, the High-Level Panel Report focused its attention on the reform of the Commission on Human Rights. Section XVII of the Report contains several recommendations in this respect: (cid:90) membership of the Commission should be expanded to univer- sal membership; (cid:90) all members of the Commission should designate prominent and experienced human rights figures as heads of their delega- tions; (cid:90) an advisory Council or Panel, possibly of 15 independent experts, appointed for their skill and according to geographic representation, should be set up to assist the Commission in addressing country-specific issues, general themes and stan- dard setting and research; (cid:90) the role of the High Commissioner should be enhanced to pro- vide the Commission with a yearly world report on human 34 Human rights and environmental protection with Res. 2001/46) or on extraju- dicial, summary or arbitrary exe- cutions (see Res. 1982/35, ex- tended with Res. 2001/45). 10. The Commission was chaired by Antonio Cassese, professor of international law at the University of Florence and first President of the International Criminal Tri- bunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It rendered its report on 25 January 2005. See \u2018Report of the Indepen- dent Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the UN SG, pursuant to SC Resolution 1564 of 18 Sep- tember 2004\u2019 (available at <http://www.reliefweb.int/li- brary/documents/2005/ici-sud- 25feb.pdf>). The Commission\u2019s conclusions and recommenda- tions were endorsed by UNSCR 1593 of 31 March 2005. It is inter- esting to note that with this Reso- lution the Security Council has re- ferred the question of atrocities committed in Darfur by Sudanese officials or individuals to the Inter- national Criminal Court, al- though Sudan is not a party to the ICC Statute. 11.

        "2 rights and liaise with the Security Council and other UN bodies to help them effectively monitor human rights compliance in the performance of their functions; (cid:90) finally, \u2018in the longer term\u2019, the Commission should be upgraded from the present status of auxiliary organ of ECOSOC to a full Charter body. 12 The proposals made by the High-Level Panel are quite sensible. They reflect real needs of improvement of a system that has become dangerously detached from both the reality of interna- tional society and the original purpose of the Charter. But they do not go far enough. That is why there is room for the EU to consider additional proposals and recommendations as a collective contri- bution to the UN reform process. Although the UN Secretary-General, in his March 2005 report, did not endorse all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, they constitute an appropriate basis on which the EU and its member states could elaborate. They could support the following initiatives on UN involvement in human right issues: streamlining, mainstreaming, and entrenching. Streamlining By this term I mean simplification and search for coherence in the present UN system of human rights implementation. Contrary to the principle of \u2018indivisibility\u2019 stated in the 1993 Vienna Declara- tion on human rights, the UN system has become more and more characterised by fragmentation and compartmentalisation. While in Europe the model of the European Convention on Human Rights was at the beginning, and remains today, that of a unitary legal instrument, of a single court and of the gradual inclusion of new rights and freedoms by way of additional proto- cols, 13 the UN system has followed the path of a multitude of human rights regimes, each with its own implementing mecha- nism. This has led to a proliferation of supervisory bodies, func- tioning in isolation one from another. There are today six major supervisory human rights bodies (\u2018Committees\u2019) serving the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimi- nation (CERD), the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimi- 35 Francesco Francioni 12. Ibid., paras. 285-9. 13. There are now 14 additional protocols, some of them con- cerned with structural reform of the system \u2013 such as the well- known Protocol XI abolishing the Commission and reforming the Strasbourg Court (see Protocol no. 11 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, restructuring the control machinery established thereby , CETS No. 155) and Protocol XIV amending the control system of the Convention (see Protocol no. 14 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Free- doms, amending the control system of the Convention , CETS no. 194) \u2013 but most of them concerned with the enlargement of the catalogue of rights originally recognized in the Convention. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 35 ",
        "2 nation Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention Against Tor- ture (CAT), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The tasks of these bodies are to examine periodic reports by state parties, to examine communications and to make general com- ments concerning relevant points of interpretation of the relevant instruments. The institutional proliferation consequent to this treaty-based approach has not led to more effective implementa- tion and better quality of human rights protection. On the con- trary: heavy reliance on periodic reports as a means for human rights monitoring has produced an unmanageable backlog in state reporting and an increasing mass of overdue reports, 14 sys- tematic delay in the committees\u2019 consideration of communica- tions and hasty consideration of state reports, with consequent foreclosure of the opportunity for constructive dialogue. State default in the presentation of periodic reports cannot be sanc- tioned. Indeed, as has been pointed out, the system paradoxically relies to a large extent on state default because, were all states to be punctual in the presentation of their reports, the congestion would be so severe as to bring the system to a halt. 15 This situation is bad enough in terms of detrimental effects of delayed consider- ation of reports and of communications. But the fragmentation of the monitoring system also produces an artificial segregation of the implementing practice of one supervisory body with respect to the others. This is hard to accept, since in human rights law, rather than the abstract proclamation of a right in the text of a treaty, what is important is the way in which the right is effectively secured in concrete situations, how it is safeguarded against possi- ble abuses of discretionary powers of national authorities, and what actual remedies are available to counteract possible viola- tions. In this situation, a \u2018streamlining\u2019 proposal by the EU could be based on the following elements: (cid:90) The six treaty committees that today monitor and evaluate state practice in the field of human rights, although remaining distinct treaty institutions, could be brought under the same umbrella of a single Human Rights Monitoring Body, whose members would be elected to perform multifunctional duties in relation to different human rights treaties and in close con- nection with the Commission on Human Rights reformed along the lines suggested by the High-Level Panel Report. (cid:90) Reporting procedures should be consolidated in a single 36 Human rights and environmental protection 14.

        "2 Human Rights Report, the content and breadth of which would depend upon the number of treaties that the reporting state has adhered to but would take into account the linkages between different types of rights. (cid:90) Communications concerning human rights violations should be addressed to and dealt with by the single Human Rights Monitoring Body on the basis of new and stringent admissibil- ity criteria, following the valuable experience accumulated in Europe with the Human Rights Commission and the Court. (cid:90) The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights should be reinforced so as to become the institutional support structure and professional secretariat of the consolidated Human Rights Monitoring Body. (cid:90) Members of the Human Rights Monitoring Body should be individuals with proven experience and professional skills in the field of human rights, chosen from a pool of names formed by lists of three names proposed by each state, in analogy with the procedure followed in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe for the nomination of judges to the Euro- pean Court of Human Rights, and reflecting equitable geo- graphic distribution. (cid:90) The Human Rights Monitoring Body would be assisted in the performance of its functions by an advisory panel consisting of representatives of NGOs, professional associations active in the field of human rights and civil society. The above proposals, if properly implemented, (a) would require minimal amendment of human rights treaties and, with some possible adaptation, no amendment whatsoever; (b) would help to overcome the present fragmentation of the UN human rights implementation by creating a single monitoring mecha- nism where the existing treaty monitoring systems would con- verge; and (c) would maintain the Advisory Council proposed by the High-Level Panel Report (para. 287) but with a different func- tion and, more important, a different composition. Such compo- sition, rather than being determined by bureaucratic manoeu- vring between the SG and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as suggested in the High-Level Panel Report, 16 ought to reflect the representative NGOs, and professional associations of lawyers, jurists and scholars concerned with human rights.

An important advantage of this approach is that human rights concerns are anticipated before adverse impacts occur, rather than being dealt with ex post facto , after dam- age has been done. 18 One of the limits of the UN approach (besides the fragmentation resulting from the plurality of human rights regimes as indicated in the previous section) is the self-contained character of UN human rights policy. The Commission on Human Rights, the supervisory bodies and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights are all involved in the business of interpreting existing human rights instruments, elucidating their scope and implementing their standards to concrete situa- tions. The risk, however, is that in doing so, these organs may find themselves in the position of a fairly isolated industry in the hands of a specialised group of experts with little impact on the policies pursued by the organisation and its agencies. This has led some commentators to speak in somewhat pejorative terms of \u2018human- rightism/ droit de l\u2019hommisme . 19 Human rights mainstreaming entails the overcoming of this insular view of human rights and a consequent striving for con- stant integration of human rights standards in the social, eco- nomic, scientific, and developmental policies of the organisation in order to forecast problems and anticipate human rights abuses. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has already started to practice this \u2018anticipatory\u2019 approach at the cog- 38 Human rights and environmental protection 17. The Network was set up by the European Commission DG Jus- tice and Home affairs in Septem- ber 2002. It is composed of 25 members, one for each member state, and its function is to moni- tor the state of respect and com- pliance with human rights in the Union and in member states on the basis of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It holds three sessions per year and pre- pares annual reports as well as thematic studies and opinions on specific issues. The last available report was published in 2004, vol.1 \u2013 Fundamental Rights Se- ries, Luxembourg, Office for Of- ficial Publications of the Euro- pean Communities. 18.

        "2 nitive level, through a series of studies assessing the impact on human rights of, inter alia , the increasing use of intellectual prop- erty rights, transnational corporations and biotechnology. 20 This approach should be encouraged and reinforced. The EU can con- tribute to the process of human rights mainstreaming in the UN, and its contribution can be all the more effective since it has already moved in this direction in its own legal system. Some ini- tial proposals and recommendations may be summarised as fol- lows: (1)Taking as a starting point Art. III 118 of the EU Constitutional Treaty, which mandates the systematic assessment of EU laws and policies in light of the need to avoid racial, sexual and reli- gious discrimination, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights should be entrusted with the task of assessing the impact of major UN initiatives, from transitional adminis- tration to peacekeeping, development plans, environmental policies etc, on internationally recognised human rights. In this connection, it is to be noted that the High-Level Panel Report, in advocating an enhanced role of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, does not make any meaningful advance toward anticipatory assessment and human rights mainstreaming as indicated above. It remains faithful to the traditional, yet inef- fective model of ex post facto reporting and monitoring, 21 whose shortcomings were examined in the preceding section. (2)Building upon the Vienna Declaration and programme of action (1993), 22 the EU could recommend that the UN, its spe- cialised agencies and UN bodies, should consider drawing up action plans, within the sphere of their respective competence, identifying steps to be taken in order to the protection of human rights. It is clear that this strategy is more ambitious than human rights impact assessment, since, unlike the latter, which is aimed at simply \u2018avoiding\u2019 an adverse effect on human rights, \u2018action plans\u2019 offer an opportunity for positive promotion of human rights. They entail anticipatory reflection on what are the best options to improve human rights and societal values, and they require consultation with civil society and coordination with dif- ferent stake-holders, thus improving democracy and participa- tion. If these virtues are easily recognisable within national soci- eties, we see no reason why they should not apply to the organs and 39 Francesco Francioni 20.

        "2 activities of the UN, to improve their channels of communication one with another and with civil society. 23 This is the best way to reinforce their democratic legitimation and deprive the enemies of multilateralism of their recurrent argument that international institutions \u2013 and indeed international law \u2013 lack a genuine demo- cratic basis. 24 Entrenching Although the protection of human rights is one of the fundamen- tal purposes of the UN, as indicated in the Preamble to the Char- ter, in Arts. 1(3), 55 and 56, it is clear that, 60 years after its foun- dation, the Charter system cannot be said to have fulfilled the promise of ensuring respect for human rights worldwide. Outside the 30 or so democracies (say, the OECD members), severe poverty, widespread discrimination and human rights violations continue to prevail. Of course, these problems should be addressed prima- rily by the concerned states. But it is a limit, and indeed a severe one in an epoch of globalisation, to continue to look at human rights purely in terms of \u2018obligations\u2019 undertaken by states in their recip- rocal relations. This narrow conception of human rights has led the UN to the present situation where its legal system and the action taken at an administrative and political level by the organi- sation and its specialised agencies is not informed by a \u2018constitu- tional\u2019 mandate to respect and fulfil human rights. Contrary to what happens in most modern democratic constitutions, where human rights represent one of the fundamental parameters for evaluating ex ante the admissibility of a given action and for judg- ing ex post facto the legality of legislative and executive action, in the UN no legal mechanism exists for ensuring that the fundamental \u2018purposes and principles\u2019 of human rights may translate in precise conditionality or bases for review and possible invalidation of acts of the organisation on human rights grounds. The Security Coun- cil and the Secretary-General do not adequately take human rights considerations and human rights records of participating coun- tries in planning and implementing peacekeeping or peace build- ing operations; financial institutions are not subject to statutory mandate to respect and protect human rights, and they resort to purely voluntary mechanisms to avoid disastrous human rights impacts of their operations and consequent international scan- dal; 25 development policies are not planned and conducted within 40 Human rights and environmental protection 23.

The myth of popular sover- eignty is being \u2018rediscovered\u2019 to at- tack the multilateral institutions, especially the UN. While this is not a novel idea, since also at the epoch of decolonisation newly in- dependent countries challenged international law in the name of self-determination and non-par- ticipation in the \u2018writing\u2019 of exist- ing rules, today this intellectual operation finds active epigones in the US. See the work of E. Posner and J. Goldsmith, The Limits of In- ternational Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005). 25. See e.g. the World Bank In- spection Panel, a three-member body instituted in 1993 with the purpose of offering an independ- ent forum to private individuals who believe that their interests have been or could be directly jeopardised by a project financed by the World Bank; see <http://wbln0018.worldbank.or g/ipn/ipnweb.nsf/WOverview/ov erview?opendocument> cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 40 ",
        "2 a precise framework of human rights and citizens\u2019 rights; not to mention the International Court of Justice, which remains a juris- diction of purely interstate disputes 26 where the opportunities for human rights adjudication are extremely rare and contingent upon the consent of the interested states. 27 This situation contrasts sharply with the EU system, where fundamental rights, even in the absence of original treaty provi- sions, have been recognised as forming part of the general princi- ples of the system applicable to states and to citizens and private persons alike, and forming part of what has been called a \u2018Euro- pean public order\u2019. This has led the EU legal system to gradually open up to the necessity of accommodating human rights and fundamental freedoms to the process of market integration in a way that makes it possible for the European Court to review the legality of member states\u2019 and the Community\u2019s action in light of general human rights parameters. 28 Taking this into account: (cid:90) The EU should seize the opportunity of the impending UN Charter reform to advance a more modern conception of human rights, that is, of a set of objective principles deriving from the international human rights treaties that are to be respected, not only by states but also by the organisation, its organs, its specialised agencies and its programmes, as well as by public and private actors in their respective fields of compe- tence and action. (cid:90) The EU should contribute to greater infusion of human rights consideration in the present system of economic globalisation, especially by supporting the efforts of the UN Sub-Commis- sion on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights towards the development of norms on the conduct of transna- tional corporations, which should be translated into national legal standards and applied as part of a modern code of corpo- rate social responsibility. (cid:90) The EU should continue to support the multilateral system of criminal justice established by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in order to combat impunity for grave breaches of human rights and international crimes. To this end, the EU could build upon Council decisions establishing points of contact in mem- ber states for the exchange of information concerning the inves- tigation of international crimes as defined in the Statute of the ICC 29 and enhancing cooperation between national authorities in the effective prosecution of international crimes. 30 41 Francesco Francioni 26. See Art. 34 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. 27. It is not by chance, therefore, that some of the most significant contributions given by the Inter- national Court of Justice to hu- man rights and humanitarian law have been provided by Advisory Opinions requested by the Gen- eral Assembly on general points of law. See in particular the Advisory Opinion on \u2018Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons\u2019, 1996 (available at <http://www.icj- cij.org/icjwww/icases/iunan/iu- nanframe.htm>), and on Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Terri- tories (see note 5 above). 28. One of the most interesting ex- amples in the ECJ human rights ju- risprudence is the recent case of Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planz\u00fcge v Republik \u00d6sterreich , Case C-112/00, judge- ment of 12 June 2003, EC Reports , 2003, p. I-05659, where the Court upheld the fundamental right to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly of a group of environmentalist who had blocked a transalpine road to protest the impact of excessive road traffic on the environment. The fundamental rights laid down in Arts. 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights were carefully balanced with the competing rights of shipping companies to free movement of goods and ultimately up-held as a legitimate aim to be pursued by the relevant member state. 29.

        "2 Protection of the environment By comparison with other threats, such as terrorism, armed con- flict and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the High-Level Panel Report devotes scant attention to the deteriora- tion of the natural environment and the reform of global environ- mental governance. The problem of environmental degradation is treated together with poverty and infectious diseases in less than 6 pages out of a total of 95 of the Report. Among the new initiatives, the Report mentions only global climate change and the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, which the Report considers insuf- ficient to meet the challenge of greenhouse gas accumulation, because of both lack of universal support and the limited time span (up to 2012) of pertinent obligations. As far as institutional reform is concerned, the Report does not put forward any new ideas, as it had done with regard to human rights, and concludes with the rather plain recommendation that \u2018[t]the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank should work in a more integrated fashion \u2013 and in partner- ship with Governments and outside research institutions \u2013 to improve vulnerability assessment and work with the most affected Governments to strengthen their adaptive capacity.\u2019 31 One could have expected more focused attention on, and wider and more in in-depth analysis of, the functional necessities of the UN system of environmental protection and its present short- comings, as well as a bolder and more creative set of recommenda- tions to improve the overall performance of the system. This is all the more surprising since academic studies and political initia- tives to improve the international institutional arrangements for environment and sustainable development have been under way for quite a while. 32 Given the complexity of the international system of environ- mental protection, with the multiplicity of treaty regimes and overlapping competences of international institutions within and beyond the UN, it is impossible, within the limits of this paper, to address all the possible aspects of the real or perceived environ- mental governance deficit of the present system. I will thus con- centrate my attention on one particularly important issue that contributes to the ineffectiveness of the overall performance of the multilateral environmental system, i.e. the normative and institu- 42 Human rights and environmental protection 31.

        "2 tional fragmentation of international environmental governance, due to the formation of a multiplicity of environmental regimes, each supported by its own \u2018institutions\u2019 ( Meeting of the Parties, Conference of the Parties, Consultative Meetings, etc.), separate secretariats, separate scientific and technical advisory bodies and compliance mechanisms. If this \u2018specialisation\u2019 is justifiable, or even unavoidable in some cases (one such case is the Antarctic environmental regime, whose specificity needs to be safeguarded in light of the unique political arrangement on which it is rooted) 33 it is clear that from a general point of view more coordi- nation and institutional cohesion of the system as a whole would be desirable. Some crucial problems must be pointed out: (cid:90) Effective multilateralism in the environmental field would require a global forum for discussing and elaborating a global environmental agenda, similar to the global trade agenda that has developed through the WTO. The United Nations Environ- mental Programme could perform this role. However, political distrust, shortage of funding and competition with other UN programmes and agencies have led to a situation where it is even difficult to list all the environmental actors competing for authority and funds. (cid:90) Effective multilateralism is not compatible with ineffectual enforcement of environmental standards and rules; some envi- ronmental protection regimes, such as the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer and the Kyoto Protocol, are supported by specific non-compliance mechanisms; but these provisions are scattered in different treaties and can hardly provide the basis for well- coordinated enforcement strategy. Effective multilateralism implies participation in international decision-making and compliance procedures of the largest and most representative countries. Due to the proliferation of international environmen- tal regimes, developing countries and small states face severe dif- ficulties in participating in the plethora of, often overlapping, Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) meetings. (cid:90) The UN should have a pivotal role in building capacity of devel- oping countries to deal with environmental problems. In part, UNEP plays this role in a wide range of environmental initia- tives, 34 but it has limited resources and its mandate can also be limited by the competing environmental responsibilities of other UN programmes, such as UNDP, or agencies such as UNESCO, FAO, IMO, the World Bank, and WHO. 43 Francesco Francioni 33. The Antarctic Treaty, adopted at Washington in 1959 (see 402 UNTS 71), serves the purpose of preserving peace in the region through the establish- ment of a system of multilateral cooperation that has laid to rest the issue of sovereignty claims, including conflicting claims over Antarctica. One of the remark- able results of the Antarctic Treaty System was the adoption in 1991 of the Madrid Protocol, with Annexes (see Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, 30 ILM 1455), which declared Antarc- tica a \u2018natural reserve\u2019 devoted to peace and science. 34. For a list of such initiatives, see UNEP/GCSS.VIII/5/Add.1 (13 February 2004), Annex. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 43 ",
        "2 (cid:90) Another adverse consequence of the fragmentation of the pres- ent system of environmental governance is the difficulty encountered in developing a constructive interaction between MEAs and the WTO. At present, MEA bodies do not have observer status in relevant WTO committees, and even UNEP is experiencing difficulties in obtaining observer status with the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment. 35 This situation does not help to reconcile free trade commitments under WTO with the requirement of securing compliance with an array of MEAs, many of which are binding upon WTO members as treaties, without, however, acquiring in their aggregate mass the authority of a legitimate public policy capable of counter- balancing specific WTO free trade obligations. (cid:90) Finally, systematic monitoring and warning on the state of the environment needs coordination and integration of data to avoid gaps in knowledge and information collection, 36 but at present such data and information are gathered and processed by individual states, independent international secretariats or NGOs. How can the EU contribute to the resolution of these problems and to better cohesion of the UN system of environmental gover- nance? There are basically two ways to deal with this problem. Consolidation of the UN environmental scheme The first way is the one suggested in the report issued by the UN Secretary-General in March 2005 37 in which, after recognising the need for a more coherent institutional framework of international environmental governance, the following recommendation is made: It is now high time to consider a more integrated structure for environmental standard setting, scientific discussion and monitoring treaty compliance. This should be built on existing institutions, such as the United Nations Environmental Pro- gramme, as well as the treaty bodies and specialized agencies. Meanwhile, environmental activities at the country level should benefit from improved synergies, on both normative and operational aspects, between the United Nations agencies, making optimal use of their comparative advantages, so that 44 Human rights and environmental protection 35. While UNEP has cooperated with WTO in regular sessions of the CTE, status in the CTE Special Session (see \u2018Existing Forms of Co- operation and Information Ex- change between UNEP/MEAS and the WTO\u2019, Note of the Secre- tariat, Doc. TN/TE/S/2, 10 June 2002), it does not appear to have obtained observer in the CTE Spe- cial Session which is supposed to carry forward the Doha Declara- tion mandate on trade and envi- ronment. 36.

        "2 we have an integrated approach to sustainable development, in which both halves of that term are given due weight. 38 As the above citation indicates, the preference of the Secretary- General is for a streamlining and consolidation of the UN envi- ronmental efforts by way of building \u2018on existing institutions\u2019. This route is certainly the easiest one from a technical and politi- cal point of view: no new institution would be required and no politically controversial overhauling of the whole system would be undertaken. However, in order to yield a reasonable expectation of improvement of the system, a certain number of functional neces- sities should be kept in mind. First, even if UNEP were to remain simply a UN programme as it is today, its funding should become adequate, predictable and stable. It is no mystery to anyone that UNEP has been constantly plagued by scarce resources, a problem that became more acute in the late 1990s with increasing dissatisfaction of major donor countries, such as the United States, and consequent decline in available resources. A response to UNEP\u2019s financial structure could be to re-design the funding system by foreseeing assessed contributions by member states in addition to voluntary contri- butions. This is an option, but, given the scale and level of criticism that UNEP has attracted in the past ten years, it is difficult to imagine that such an option would find political support, espe- cially among the industrialised UN member states. Second, a revamped UNEP will be possible only to the extent that it is given real authority within the UN system and clear oper- ational capacity with regard to the mounting complexity of the threats to the global environment. However, since its creation, fol- lowing the 1972 Stockholm conference, the UNEP mandate has been quite limited. It was meant to provide monitoring of envi- ronmental developments, serve as a \u2018clearing house\u2019 for environ- mental information and provide impetus and coordination in the development and implementation of international environmen- tal agreements. UNEP has performed these functions quite well; in some it has actually excelled, as in the Regional Seas pro- gramme, and in others it has out-performed its original mandate, as in the sponsoring of a great variety of multilateral conferences, programmes and agreements, ranging from hazardous waste to dangerous chemicals, air pollution, land degradation and water resources management. Today, it seems that it has stretched to its 45 Francesco Francioni 38.

        "2 limit. It is quite doubtful that with the present institutional struc- ture, and with the further inconvenient of a headquarters located in Nairobi, far removed from the main centres of UN agencies and organisations, more authority and operational capacity could be achieved without institutional reform. Third, an essential condition for improving the effectiveness of UNEP would be a better integration of environmental protection into the socio-economic policies pursued by other UN agencies and programmes. This is what the 2005 Report by the Secretary- General calls \u2018improved synergies . . . between United Nations agencies, making optimal use of their comparative advantages, so that we have an integrated approach to sustainable development.\u2019 To obtain such result, however, it would be necessary to align the two separate UNEP and UNDP \u2018programmes\u2019, through a system- atic, institutional division of tasks between the two programmes so as to avoid duplication, competition over financial resources, and ensure joint management of projects, particularly those funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This could be achieved through the negotiation of a Memorandum of Under- standing between UNEP and UNDP. Similarly, in its relations with the World Bank, UNEP could have an enhanced role in the management of the GEF funds to support developing countries\u2019 efforts in securing compliance with their international environ- mental obligations, including climate change and biodiversity. However, this move also seems to be problematic, in view of the foreseeable opposition from the World Bank. As has been pointed out, a more realistic option would be that of a \u2018joint operation of the GEF by the World Bank and UNEP . . . in order for the two organizations to share the responsibility of project selection, appraisal and supervision, in accordance with the respective spheres of expertise.\u2019 39 As we can see, in spite of its apparent simplicity, the option of improving international environmental governance through the strengthening of UNEP presents important challenges of a finan- cial, legal and political nature. It is our view that the very weak institutional status and the legacy of, not always deserved, distrust on the part of some leading members of the UN, would render it extremely difficult for the EU to gamble on a reinforced UNEP as the new environmental authority in the reformed UN Charter sys- tem. 46 Human rights and environmental protection 39.

        "2 A new global environmental organisation Another option to be considered by the EU in view of strengthen- ing international environmental governance is the creation of a new organisation having general competence in the environmen- tal field. This option, which has been promoted by France in par- ticular 40 and is currently supported by a number of EU member states, can be pursued in two distinct versions. One version would be the creation of a UN Environmental Agency, i.e. an organisa- tion endowed with its own legal personality but placed within the UN; the other version would be the creation of a totally independ- ent world environmental organisation, along the lines of the WTO. These two models have several advantages in common: (1) they would place the current system of international environmen- tal governance on a more stable institutional basis; (2) they would bring under the same institutional umbrella the vast array of mul- tilateral environmental agreements; (3) they would presumably be able to facilitate the acceptance of international environmental standards by developing dialogue among governmental and non- governmental actors; (4) because of the new institutional struc- ture, one may expect that they would be the catalyst for a stronger environmental solidarity and fiduciary spirit among participants, which would foster more coherent action for environmental pro- tection; (5) they could provide a forum for global environmental monitoring and for dispute settlement, a function that is acutely lacking in the present fragmented and decentralised system of environmental protection. 41 Naturally, in order to create any of these environmental organ- isations it would be necessary to negotiate a new multilateral treaty. To this end, it would be desirable to involve in the negotia- tions, besides all the UN members, the most important stakehold- ers in environmental governance, including the relevant UN agen- cies and programmes, the main MEA secretariats, the World Bank, the GEF, and representatives from leading environmental NGOs and the private sector. This would certainly not be an easy task. However, since the present UN system clearly presents a deficit of environmental governance and since the United States seems reluctant to engage in a fresh effort to strengthen multilateral cooperation in this field \u2013 as it appears from its recalcitrant posi- tion with respect to the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention on Biological Diversity \u2013 it would seem appropriate for the EU to seize this opportunity for UN reform to take the lead in promoting the 47 Francesco Francioni 40. See the preliminary studies cited above, notes 35 and 43. 41. This results in having the WTO dispute settlement mechanism being asked to resolve disputes in- volving the legality of environmen- tal measures having the effect of impacting on free movement of goods and services.

        "2 creation of a new international environmental organisation fol- lowing one of the two models described above. In addition, the EU could be instrumental in gathering the consensus of developing countries on such reform, building upon its long-standing rela- tionship with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, through the once Lom\u00e9, now Cotonou cooperation agreements, and with other associated states, with which it has increasingly strengthened environmental cooperation. 42 Conclusion As this paper has tried to demonstrate, the High-Level Panel Report and the subsequent March 2005 Report prepared by the UN Secretary-General do not exhaustively address the present threats and challenges to the international system of human rights protection and environmental governance. The above-men- tioned documents focus rather on military security, peacekeeping, use of force and the enhanced role of the Security Council in main- taining world order. But world order and effective multilateralism cannot be divorced from a strong sense of legitimacy and collective recognition that the UN and other international institutions serve the common good of the people. At a time when the excesses of unilateralism and superpower politics are accompanied by increasing annoyance with the encroachment of international law on national sovereignty, and by open attacks on the legitimacy and democratic foundation of international institutions, 43 it is all the more important to strengthen the UN commitment to human rights and environmental protection. These are indeed two essen- tial components of global governance, security, democracy and human welfare, values to which the EU has anchored its constitu- tional development. The EU should consequently play a leading role in the enhancement of the protection of human rights and the environment during the current efforts to reform the UN Charter. 48 Human rights and environmental protection 42.

        "EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping: a promising relationship in a constrained environment Thierry Tardy 1 The relationship between the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN) in the field of crisis management has gone through major changes over the last five years. On the UN side, the constraints imposed by the changing and ever-demanding nature of peacekeeping have led the organisation to seek increased sup- port from regional actors, the EU among others. On the European side, the development of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) logically led the EU to revisit its relationship with the UN, both as a legitimising body and as the main peacekeeping imple- menter. The convergence of these two trends has led to a genuine inter-institutional rapprochement. Yet this process has taken place in a highly constrained envi- ronment. Structurally, even though both the UN and the EU have displayed a will to move forward in their relations, the differences in the organisations\u2019 respective agendas, vocations, constituencies and means limit the scope of their cooperation in the field of peace operations. Peacekeeping imposes itself on the UN more than it does on the EU. The UN approach is inspired by an open agenda, while the European policy combines self-interest and the necessity to respond to conscience-shocking situations. In general, it is the EU rather than the UN that sets the agenda and defines the terms of the UN-EU relationship, which is charac- terised by a divide between what the UN wants and what the EU is willing to offer. Africa, as a great security-consumer where both the UN and the EU must play a role, illustrates the EU-UN divide as much as it tests cooperation between them. In the shorter term, the EU-UN rapprochement is being confronted with the simulta- neous reform processes of the two institutions, which includes a high degree of uncertainty surrounding both the overhaul of the UN and the ratification of the European Constitution. In this context, the two institutions have achieved a significant amount, in terms of increasing knowledge of respective function- ing and activities, institutionalised framework of cooperation and 49 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism 1.

        "3 practical cooperation. In relative terms, although the EU is not formally a \u2018regional arrangement\u2019 in the sense of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, it is the regional organisation that has gone the furthest in its relationship with the UN, and it is also the one that offers the most promising perspectives of cooperation at both the military and civilian levels. The UN welcomes EU efforts and is willing to take advantage of the EU crisis management policy. Yet the UN also aspires to include such a policy as much as possible into its broader framework, and calls for a more direct EU partici- pation in UN-led peace operations. This paper will look at three facets of the EU-UN relationship in peace operations. It will first look at the nature of the environ- ment and the constraints attached to it. In a second part, it will deal with the achievements of the EU-UN relationship. It will finally address the modalities of their relations, exploring the dif- ferent scenarios of EU-UN cooperation in the broader field of cri- sis management. A highly constrained environment The question of EU-UN relations in peacekeeping is a multifaceted one, as it comes at the junction of different state actors\u2019 policies vis- \u00e0-vis an activity \u2013 peace operations \u2013 which is complex and multidi- mensional by nature, and approached differently depending on where it is to take place (Europe, Africa, elsewhere), through which framework (UN, regional organisations, coalitions) and for what purpose (mandate, level of force required, etc.). UN overstretch . . . In this context, the UN and the EU are no doubt in a different situ- ation. Through its Security Council, the UN is the legalising and legitimising body for peace operations, and the only organisation that can authorise the use of force in international relations. At the operational level, the UN is by far the international organisation the most involved in peace operations. With 16 missions as at March 2005 and around 67,000 military personnel and civilian police deployed, the UN counts more people in peacekeeping oper- ations than all regional and subregional organisations put together. Such a level of deployment, combined with the increas- 50 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 50 ",
        "3 ingly complex nature of its missions, pushes the limits of the UN\u2019s operational capacity. Facing overstretch, the UN Secretariat is con- stantly looking for ways to fill gaps, by reforming itself, as the Brahimi Report on Peace Operations suggested in 2000, and by asking states and regional organisations \u2013 as the Secretary-Gen- eral\u2019s report \u2018In larger freedom\u2019 does 2 \u2013 to provide the assets that are needed for complex and robust peacekeeping. It is here that the EU can play an important role. Through ESDP, the EU is developing crisis management capacities that pre- cisely the UN is lacking. The UN faces shortages in troops, but above all in rapid reaction capacity and in what it calls \u2018enabling assets\u2019, such as movement control, intelligence, medical units or logistics, which are less available than infantry battalions. The UN Secretariat recurrently calls on the EU and its member states to provide such resources, and welcomes any EU initiative that strengthens the UN capacity directly or indirectly. 3 In the mean- time, there has been concern within the UN that the whole ESDP process would develop to the detriment of the UN inclusive approach as well as of UN peacekeeping needs. . . . versus EU ambivalence Faced with this situation, EU member states\u2019 policies are ambivalent. On the one hand, the EU and EU member states are strong supporters of the UN, in accordance with the European Security Strategy and the concept of \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019. 4 EU states are attached to the centrality and legitimising power of the UN Security Council, and the EU as such has gained some political clout within UN bodies 5 beyond the role played by the Commission in economic and development affairs. At the finan- cial level, the EU states\u2019 shares of the UN regular and peacekeep- ing budgets are very high, with respectively 37.75 per cent and 39 per cent. 6 On the other hand, the strong emphasis that the EU places on its political autonomy leads it to somehow distance itself from the UN. For example, obtaining a UN mandate for ESDP operations does not appear to be a requirement as long as these operations are deployed in Europe, with the consent of the host state, and are of a non coercive or civilian nature. In Europe, the examples are the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Operations Concor- dia and Proxima in FYROM that were not created by a UNSC reso- 51 Thierry Tardy 2.

        "3 lution; outside of Europe, the three civilian operations in Georgia (EUJUST THEMIS), Kinshasa (EUPOL KINSHASA), and Iraq (EUJUST LEX) provide other examples. Most importantly, while EU member states are major contrib- utors to UN- mandated peace operations, they contribute very little to UN- led operations. As of March 2005, EU member states accounted for 6.52 per cent of UN troops, 7 a percentage that decreases to 2.24 per cent for UN operations in Africa, 8 the conti- nent where peacekeeping needs are by far the greatest. For well- known political and military reasons with origins in the UN peace- keeping records of the early 1990s, Western states in general have become reluctant to participate in UN-led operations, and have over the last ten years favoured regional organisations (EU and NATO) or coalitions of states for their crisis management activi- ties. Consequently, even if EU representatives are right in saying that EU member states\u2019 military capabilities are not \u2018frozen for ESDP purposes\u2019, 9 in practice, the probability that such assets would be deployed in UN operations is likely to remain low and in any case subject to very specific conditions. This situation concerns the relationship between EU member states and the UN more so than that of the EU, as most EU assets belong to the individual states. However, the general reticence of the European states to place troops under UN command, in addi- tion to their scepticism about the reliability of the UN structure in general, are concerns that are echoed within the EU itself and its politico-military structure, and that both negatively impact the EU-UN relationship. EU rigidity also finds some grounds in the specificity of ESDP operations. The key principle of the EU deci- sion-making autonomy in this field makes subordination to the UN difficult. Any ESDP operation is, in principle, placed under political control and strategic direction of the Political and Secu- rity Committee (PSC). It is the involvement of the EU politico-mil- itary structure, much more than the commitment of EU member states\u2019 troops, which defines a given operation as a European Union operation. It follows that the mere idea that EU member states\u2019 assets could simultaneously be part of an EU operation and placed under UN command clashes with ESDP philosophy. Here a distinction has to be made between military and civilian assets, since the readiness of EU member states to include civilian assets as a component of a UN operation is higher than in the military sphere (see the third part of this essay). 52 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 7. 4,378 military observers, civil- ian police and troops from EU member states out of 67,150 as of 31 March 2005; Monthly Sum- mary of Contributions, UN web- site. 8. 1,148 military observers, civil- ian police and troops from EU member states out of 51,208 de- ployed in Africa as of 31 March 2005; Monthly Summary of Con- tributions, UN website. 9. \u2018EU-UN Cooperation in Mili- tary Crisis Management Opera- tions \u2013 Elements of Implementa- tion of the EU-UN Joint Declaration\u2019ESDP Presidency Re- port, Annex II, European Council, 15 June 2004, para. 4. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 52 ",
        "3 This being said, the general absence of European states from UN- led operations has to be checked against their presence in UN- mandated operations. Such a contribution is quite high, from the Balkans to Afghanistan, but with NATO playing the most promi- nent role. This raises the question of what the most effective chan- nels are to serve the UN Charter\u2019s ultimate goal of maintaining international peace and security. For EU member states, there is no doubt that their strong involvement in peace operations is complementary to overall UN efforts. If those operations are EU- led, they should consequently be seen as part of the broader EU- UN picture. For the UN, national or regional contributions to peacekeeping activities are encouraged as long as they are not exclusive of direct contributions to UN-led operations. One con- cern here is the development of two-speed peace operations, some UN-led, relatively poor, ill-equipped and with weak political back- ing, and others led by states or regional organisations such as the EU or NATO, which would be politically and militarily better sup- ported. The other concern lies in the rift between Africa on the one hand, where the needs are but would be neglected by the \u2018rich\u2019 organisations, and other places on the other hand, which would better benefit from Western/Northern attention. Given these two sets of concerns, no doubt a test case of EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping will arise in Africa. These different elements come as constraints imposed on the EU-UN relationship in the field of peace operations. To sum- marise, while the UN is in a position to demand that the EU com- mit itself to supporting UN activities, the EU is constrained by a number of factors which limit its favourable response to UN requests and restrict the scope of its cooperation. Some tangible achievements It is in this constrained environment that the achievements as well as opportunities of EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping have to be considered. This cooperation was illustrated during the 1990s, in the Balkans in particular, where both the UN and the EU were in one way or another involved in the management of the Yugoslav conflicts. Yet the idea that cooperation on crisis management should be closely looked at and possibly institutionalised came up in earnest in 2000, at a time when the UN was examining the reform 53 Thierry Tardy cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 53 ",
        "3 of its peace operations through the Brahimi Report process and the EU was laying the foundations of ESDP. Initially, though, the idea that the EU and the UN should coop- erate in the peacekeeping field was not obvious within the two institutions and their member states. On the UN side, some scep- ticism was expressed regarding the establishment of channels of communication with regional organisations, which was perceived as placing the UN and these organisations on the same level. More- over, any move that was seen as giving the EU preferential treat- ment was not perceived favourably. On the EU side, there was a strong sentiment that the ESDP should be developed without excessive linking to the UN. The first steps of the EU-UN dialogue It is in this context that, after initial talks between the two institu- tions in the second part of the year 2000, 10 the ESDP Report to the Nice European Council underlined the \u2018value of cooperation between the Union and the United Nations . . . as the Union develops its crisis-management and conflict-prevention capabilities\u2019, and further stated that \u2018[t]he efforts made will enable Europeans in par- ticular to respond more effectively and more coherently to requests from leading organisations such as the UN or the OSCE.\u2019 11 A document was then elaborated in 2001 under the EU Swedish presidency on \u2018EU-UN cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis management\u2019. 12 Three issues, \u2018conflict prevention\u2019, \u2018civilian and military aspects of crisis management\u2019 and \u2018particular regional issues\u2019, were identified as themes and areas for EU-UN cooperation. The document also established modalities for meetings at different levels between the two institutions. In the meantime, the G\u00f6teborg European Council adopted a document on \u2018EU cooperation with international organisations in civilian aspects of crisis manage- ment\u2019 13 which defined four guiding principles of the Union\u2019s coop- eration with international organisations, 14 as well as putting for- ward different options of EU civilian participation in crisis management operations led by international organisations. 15 The first EU operations: successful tests of EU-UN cooperation The next important step came in 2003 with the creation of the first ESDP operations: two of them \u2013 the EU Police Mission in Bosnia 54 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 10.

        "3 and Herzegovina (EUPM) and Operation Artemis in the Democra- tic Republic of Congo (DRC) \u2013 constituted real tests for the EU-UN relationship. In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the EU took over the UN International Police Task Force (IPTF), with the objec- tive of ensuring a \u2018seamless transition\u2019 from UN to EU responsibil- ity. That was achieved through inter-institutional cooperation in the planning phase, collocation of EU and UN teams in Sarajevo, information-sharing, and double-hatting of Sven Christian Fred- eriksen, simultaneously IPTF Commissioner and Head of the EUPM Planning Team, and then EUPM Commissioner. Once the EUPM was launched, cooperation between the two organisations was maintained through liaison officers, and the EU established contact on the ground with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and UNHCR. In the meantime, some les- sons-learnt exercises were conducted on the transition. While over- all EU-UN cooperation was assessed positively, one issue that arose was that double-hatting of the head of mission created an addi- tional workload that was difficult to digest. Moreover, the take- over by the EU of an existing mission meant that the EU was not able to shape it as it would have had it created it. Since the launch of the EU mission, and following the UNSC invitation to the EU to \u2018keep it regularly informed, as appropriate, on the activities of EUPM\u2019, 16 reports have been issued by the High Representative for CFSP and sent to the UN Security Council every six months. The first report commends EU-UN cooperation and says that \u2018[while] the EUPM is the first experience of coopera- tion in the field between the UN and EU\u2019, it \u2018illustrates that a smooth and efficient transition of responsibility from the UN to EU in a crisis management operation is no longer an aspiration but a concrete component of our cooperation.\u2019 17 The EU involvement in the DRC was of a fundamentally differ- ent nature. In the summer of 2003, the EU conducted its first autonomous military operation in the north-eastern part of the DRC (Ituri, city of Bunia). This occurred at the request of the UN, under a UN mandate, and as a temporary endeavour eventually taken over by a reinforced component of the UN operation (MONUC, Ituri Task Force). EU and UN activities were therefore intimately linked throughout the planning and the deployment of the operation. Operation Artemis \u2013 officially called Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) \u2013 was formally created by UNSC Resolution 1484 of 30 May 2003 and by the Council Joint 55 Thierry Tardy 16.

        "3 Action of 5 June 2003. 18 The Security Council resolution was adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and authorised the member states participating in the force to \u2018take all necessary measures to fulfill its mandate\u2019. The Security Council formally created the force, but subcontracted its implementation to the EU, with no subordination of any sort between the two institu- tions. The Security Council only requested the leadership of the force \u2018to report regularly to the Council through the Secretary- General, on the implementation of its mandate\u2019, 19 which Javier Solana did once, in July 2003, by addressing the Security Coun- cil. 20 Artemis was placed under political control and strategic direction of the PSC, with France, as the framework nation, play- ing the key role in the planning process as well as in the conduct of the operation. EU-UN cooperation on Artemis was assessed positively by both organisations. Initially, the fact that the operation came as a response by the EU to a request formulated by the UN Secretary- General, which was then endorsed by the Security Council, facili- tated the formal creation of the operation. In the pre-deployment phase, the UN deplored the lack of information coming from the EU \u2013 in particular on the deployment of the IEMF \u2013 which could have caused incidents when the EU force and UN peacekeepers were simultaneously deployed. 21 But overall, communication was established at different levels (New York/Brussels and on the ground) and once Artemis had been deployed, cooperation with MONUC proved to be satisfactory. The deployment of the first elements of the Ituri Task Force in mid-August 2003 also led to valuable cooperation between the two forces. Most importantly, EU cooperation with the UN Secretariat (and with Bangladesh as the main contributor to the Ituri Task Force) to make sure that MONUC could take over in September 2003 as agreed, proved to be successful. This point was of crucial importance, since the UN\u2019s ability to take over Artemis constituted the exit strategy for the EU. Yet EU-UN cooperation was put to the test when EU member states were asked by the UN Secretariat to \u2018re-hat\u2019 some of their assets and to make them available to the UN after the departure of Artemis . The re-hatting of forces was implemented in East Timor in 1999, where Australia, which acted as the lead nation in the UN- mandated operation INTERFET, agreed to keep some of its troops in the UN-led operation (UNTAET), thus guaranteeing its credi- 56 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 18. \u2018Council Joint Action 2003/423/CFSP of 5 June 2003 on the EU military operation in the DRC\u2019, Official Journal of the European Communities , L 143/50, 11 June 2003. 19.

The \u2018East Timor model\u2019 has often been praised by UN repre- sentatives, 22 who see in it the opportunity for the UN to benefit from Western states\u2019 key military assets, but who are also anxious to \u2018narrow the commitment gap\u2019 23 between the developing and the developed world. In the case of the DRC, the request to re-hat was dismissed by the Europeans; locally, this jeopardised the credibility of MONUC. 24 But in the context of EU-UN relations, the European stance revealed the limits of cooperation; it showed what the EU and its member states were ready to do (support through a sepa- rate operation), but also what they would not do (support within the UN operation). In his address to the Security Council on 18 July 2003, Javier Solana stressed that a reinforced MONUC \u2018should have a mandate and rules of engagement similar to those of the European Union force, i.e. a mandate under Chapter VII.\u2019 He continued by saying that this force should have the \u2018equipment and military resources necessary to accomplish its mission and implement the mandate and rules of engagement.\u2019 Yet none of the EU states participated in the strengthened UN force that took over Artemis . The EU has remained present in the DRC through a series of initiatives related to civilian crisis management: a programme of strategic support totaling \u20ac 205 million adopted in 2003, and the creation of a Police Mission in Kinshasa (EUPOL KINSHASA) in December 2004. In so far as EU-UN cooperation is concerned, the EU also decided, in response to UN calls for reinforcing MONUC, to provide it access to the EU Satellite Centre\u2019s capabilities. 25 All together, these different measures taken by the EU to sup- port the UN in the DRC are to be commended, as they do strengthen overall crisis management efforts. Yet they fall short of a direct strengthening of MONUC via the deployment of EU member states\u2019 assets on the ground, which would be most wel- comed by the UN. Drawing on field cooperation: battle groups, UN-EU Joint Dec- laration and \u2018beauty contest\u2019 Notwithstanding the shortcomings of EU-UN cooperation revealed by Operation Artemis , this episode constituted a major breakthrough in relations between the two institutions. It forced them to work together on the ground, and therefore to become bet- 57 Thierry Tardy 22.

At the conceptual level, it led to the elaboration by the EU of the \u2018battle groups\u2019 concept, which should become one of the most visible expressions of EU-UN relations in the future (see below). Likewise, Operation Artemis brought institutionalisation of EU-UN cooperation one step further, with the signature on 24 September 2003 of the \u2018Joint Declaration on UN-EU Cooperation in Crisis Management\u2019 by the UN Secretary-General and the EU presidency. The declaration took note of the recent developments in EU-UN cooperation and identified four areas where further cooperation should be explored: planning, training, communication and best practices . A \u2018joint consultative mechanism\u2019, named Steering Committee, was established at working level to enhance coordina- tion in these four areas and to follow through with the implemen- tation of the Joint Declaration. In the meantime, the European Commission released an important Communication on EU-UN relations, 26 which offered an in-depth analysis of the EU general posture vis-\u00e0-vis the UN, in addition to calling for a renewed EU commitment to multilateralism. The Communication also put forward recommendations on how to maximise EU benefits in a wider EU-UN partnership, going far beyond peacekeeping issues. Since September 2003, the Steering Committee has met twice a year, and points of contact have been established (or developed) at different levels of the two secretariats. Work has been conducted on training standards and modules; UN personnel have partici- pated in EU training courses; and a continued dialogue on plan- ning and EU-UN operational cooperation has taken place, as in the EU-UN exercise of April 2005. With these different initiatives and achievements, the EU-UN relationship in the field of peacekeeping has gone through major evolutions. What used to be of a rhetorical nature a few years ago has become tangible at both institutional and field levels. Throughout these years, the UN has often tried to involve the EU further than the EU was able or willing to commit. The UN has oscillated between a relative optimism, stemming from the poten- tial of the UN-EU relationship, and concerns, about the EU\u2019s rather self-interested peacekeeping policy. However, despite the differences of approach, the EU-UN rela- tionship has developed further and faster than the relationship between the UN and any other regional organisation. Moreover, this relationship may be seen as a model to be replicated, between the UN and African organisations for example. 58 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 26. \u2018The EU and the UN: The Choice of Multilateralism\u2019, Com- munication from the European Commission, Brussels, 10 Sep- tember 2003. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 58 ",
        "3 In a sense, the UN appeal to the EU is an acknowledgement of its nascent crisis management capacity. This pleases the EU in gen- eral terms, but can also be reframed in the broader context of EU- NATO relations, where the EU needs to assert its political and operational capacity, and therefore also in the context of UN- NATO relations. As if he wanted to place the EU and NATO in competition, Kofi Annan acknowledged before the Sub-Commit- tee on Transatlantic Relations in March 2004 that the \u2018unrivalled [NATO] capability to deploy rapidly and robustly can have a major impact on the UN\u2019s work for peace and security,\u2019 and further stated that \u2018NATO might be employed in a \u2018peace enforcement\u2019 role, much as the EU deployed Operation Artemis in the Democra- tic Republic of Congo as a bridging force before the deployment of a UN operation.\u2019 27 This situates the three organisations in a trian- gular relationship that changes the nature of the EU-UN relation- ship alone. For the UN, the idea is clearly to develop partnerships with as many organisations as possible, in a non-exclusive way. For the EU, this raises the issue of its ability to perform in the \u2018beauty contest\u2019. But for EU member states that are also NATO member states, at stake is also the extent to which NATO should play a role in the crisis management field, and the division of labour between NATO and the EU in this respect. EU support beyond peacekeeping: the need for increased coherence Finally, besides the above-mentioned achievements, the EU may also invoke its role in supporting the UN crisis management policy at other equally important levels. 28 This encompasses several com- ponents, ranging from the EU contribution in the broad field of conflict prevention to its multifaceted involvement in the peace- building phase. Taking the case of Africa, in line with the ESDP Action Plan for Africa, 29 the EU role in the strengthening of African peacekeeping capacities, the financing of some components or programmes of peace operations (through the Peace Facility for Africa and through the support of DDR and SSR 30 programmes), the politi- cal and technical support to the African Union (in Darfur for example) and ECOWAS, 31 the participation in joint fact-finding missions (as was the case in Burundi in February 2004 with a EU- UN joint fact-finding mission conducted prior to the establish- 59 Thierry Tardy 27.

In his report \u2018In larger freedom\u2019, the UN Secretary-General called for the \u2018establishment of an inter- locking system of peacekeeping capacities that will enable the UN to work with relevant regional organisations in predictable and reliable partnerships.\u2019 32 In Africa, there is no doubt that such collaboration should go beyond peacekeeping activities. In the broader field of crisis man- agement, the EU and the UN may think, in close cooperation with regional and subregional actors, of a strategic partnership that would take account of their respective capacities and comparative advantages. The potential for EU-UN cooperation is immense in this context, and the EU holistic approach, combining a wide vari- ety of instruments, is a unique comparative advantage. The role of the European Commission is here particularly important. The EU could draw on what the Commission has done in regards to the implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals. The EU has displayed a will to move in that direction, reflected by the ESDP Action Plan for Africa and the \u2018battle group\u2019 concept. However, it will also remain vigilant to ensure a certain degree of flexibility and autonomy of action vis-\u00e0-vis the UN and other organisations. Overly constraining commitments will therefore be avoided. In any case, if such a comprehensive partnership is to be sought, it will require a much more coherent and coordinated approach from the EU, both in terms of the nature of the policy (combining economic, political and security elements) and of the bodies that would implement it (States, Council Secretariat, Com- mission). The modalities of EU-UN cooperation The work conducted by the two organisations over the last five years, combined with the experience acquired in the recent opera- tions, has led the two secretariats to elaborate a number of scenar- ios of EU-UN cooperation in peace operations. These scenarios are not all agreed upon by the two institutions and some only reflect their respective aspirations. However, they all revolve around the degree of involvement of the EU in a given crisis management activ- ity (be it UN-led or UN-mandated), and give particular importance to the three following factors: the nature of the crisis management 60 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 32.

        "3 activity, i.e. military or civilian; the sequence of EU and UN deploy- ments, taking place simultaneously or subsequently; and the degree of EU and EU member states assets\u2019 deployment within a UN operation. Almost all scenarios of EU-UN cooperation are determined by the combination of these three elements, to which one can add the presence or absence of a UN mandate. 33 Based on these elements, a synthesis of the two organisations\u2019 aspirations leads to the identification of six main scenarios. Scenario 1: National contributions and the \u2018clearing house process\u2019 When allowing for a contribution to a UN operation, the EU first considers the provision of national capabilities, both military and civilian. As mentioned earlier, for the time being such contribu- tions are extremely limited, and while they could indeed make a dif- ference for the UN, they would fall short of a real \u2018EU\u2019 contribu- tion. 34 However, the EU also envisages a role in the coordination of national contributions to UN-led operations, through a mecha- nism called the \u2018clearing house process\u2019. Such a system would cre- ate a \u2018framework by which member states could, on a voluntary basis, exchange information on their contributions to a given UN operation and, if they so decide, co-ordinate these national contri- butions\u2019. The system was activated in autumn 2004 following a UN request to strengthen MONUC in the DRC, and led to the decision to make the EU Satellite Centre available to the UN. Following this case, this system could be of particular interest for the coordina- tion of the deployment of \u2018enabling assets\u2019 in UN operations. Scenario 2: The \u2018stand-alone model\u2019 At the other end of the spectrum, the EU could conduct an opera- tion under a UN mandate, at the request of the UN or as an EU ini- tiative, which, once created, would have no link with the UN struc- ture. Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides an example. In this case, the EU may report regularly to the UN Secu- rity Council (via the UN Secretary-General), 35 but no other form of communication would be envisaged. The EU would act as a sub- contractor of the UN or, put differently, the UN would act (only) as the mandating body of the EU. 61 Thierry Tardy 33. On the scenarios, see also T.

        "3 Beyond these two options, which do not imply a high level of inter-institutional cooperation, four possibilities of EU-UN coop- eration can be identified: (cid:90) an EU operation preceding a UN operation; (cid:90) an EU operation taking over a UN operation; (cid:90) an EU operation deployed simultaneously with a UN operation; (cid:90) an EU component of a UN operation. Scenario 3: An EU operation preceding a UN operation \u2013 the \u2018bridging model\u2019 Two of the key challenges that current UN operations are facing are rapid deployment once an operation has been formally created and rapid reaction when the mandate of an operation is jeopar- dised by incidents taking place on the ground (peacekeepers being taken hostage, activities of spoilers, populations under immediate threat of physical violence, etc.). It is these two types of activities in particular for which the UN has sought EU cooperation and assis- tance. Cooperation between the two organisations to palliate the shortages of UN rapid deployment capacity was best illustrated by Operation Artemis , which then led to the elaboration of the \u2018battle group\u2019 concept. Through what is called the \u2018bridging model\u2019, the EU envisages the rapid deployment of an operation \u2013 a battle group \u2013 at the request of the UN and with the objective of provid- ing \u2018the UN with time to mount a new operation or to reorganise an existing one\u2019. For the EU, this option requires a \u2018rapid deploy- ment of appropriate military capabilities and agreed duration and end-state\u2019. 36 Such a model implies a \u2018subcontracted\u2019 operation, as is the case with Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The difference between the two lies in the sequence \u2013 since a UN opera- tion takes over in the bridging model \u2013 and therefore in the degree of cooperation between the two institutions. This model corresponds to a new trend in peace operations by which regional organisations (or states) go first to a crisis zone for a limited period of time before the UN takes over for a longer term. In addition to the Artemis -MONUC or INTERFET-UNTAET examples, such was the case for the three West African operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast (where the UN took over ECOWAS operations), and also in Haiti (UN takeover of a coali- tion of states) or in Burundi (UN takeover of an African Union 62 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 36. \u2018EU-UN Cooperation in Mili- tary Crisis Management Opera- tions \u2013 Elements of Implementa- tion of the EU-UN Joint Declaration\u2019, Annex II, ESDP Pres- idency Report, European Council, 15 June 2004, para. 9. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 62 ",
        "3 operation). In all these cases, the idea is to draw on comparative advantages of different institutions, and to somehow organise the division of labour between the UN and regional organisations. Indeed, the \u2018bridging model\u2019 offers a series of advantages and meets the aspirations of both the UN and the EU. However, it also raises the issue of the compatibility between EU peacekeeping and UN peacekeeping. EU documents acknowledge that \u2018the exit strat- egy from such an operation is the arrival, in time, of a UN force able to take over the EU force deployed and tailored to the mission.\u2019 37 That ability of the UN to take over in good conditions was raised in the DRC. The very fact that the UN becomes part of the exit strategy of the EU is a challenge for the UN. It implies that the UN raises its standards and manages to somehow meet the EU requirements. It also means that the two organisations work together at different levels, outside and during operations, to guarantee a certain degree of compatibility and therefore a smooth transition. Such dialogue falls within the implementa- tion of the Joint Declaration on UN-EU Cooperation and is cur- rently conducted between the Department of Peacekeeping Oper- ations (DPKO) and the EU Council Secretariat in the framework of the Steering Committee. This model also leads us back to the issue of \u2018re-hatting\u2019 EU forces into the UN operation, which is favoured by the UN but contemplated reluctantly within the EU. The decision to \u2018re-hat\u2019 will remain a national one, which means that \u2018EU assets\u2019 that would be \u2018re-hatted\u2019 could be \u2018re-nationalised\u2019 in the UN opera- tion. Short of re-hatting, the EU will anyway have to be ready to install some information-sharing mechanisms with the UN, which is the sine qua non of a smooth transition. Furthermore, as the ability of the UN to take over \u2018in time\u2019 or to deploy a well-tai- lored operation will never be guaranteed, the two institutions must develop the options by which the EU stays on the ground, in parallel with the UN, and theoretically for a limited period of time. The bridging model is contemplated in the civilian sphere in simi- lar terms, with a focus on police forces. Here, cooperation is addressed by the EU more openly than in the military sphere. The December 2004 ESDP Presidency Report states that \u2018practical issues such as information-sharing, advanced co-location of EU officials in the UN mission, some possibly double-hatted, and pos- sible re-hatting between UN and EU operations should be taken into due consideration.\u2019 38 63 Thierry Tardy 37.

        "3 The bridging model was further explored in the EU-UN exer- cise conducted in April 2005 (EST 05), which examined the issue of transition between the EU and the UN in three different cases: a UN military operation taking over an EU operation ( Artemis type); an EU police operation taking over a UN operation (UNIPTF- EUPM type; see scenario 4); and health and medical support. The exercise, which was not a joint EU-UN exercise but EU-led, with the UN being invited to participate, looked at the practical modal- ities of EU-UN cooperation, drawing on previous operations. A certain number of points were clarified, particularly in relation to the use of battle groups at the request of the UN, as well as issues such as planning, chains of command, rules of engagement, liai- son officers or information-sharing. In so far as the use of the battle groups is concerned, while the UN Secretariat welcomes the EU initiative, UN officials have expressed the wish that the battle groups be possibly placed under UN command, that they be deployed for more than 120 days (for example by deploying two battle groups one after the other), and that they be possibly re-hatted (\u2018blue-hatted\u2019) at the end of the transition. 39 In response, the EU might contemplate a deploy- ment of the battle groups in a more flexible way, but the possibil- ity to have EU-labelled military assets put under UN command continues to meet strong reluctance in EU capitals. Scenario 4: An EU operation taking over a UN operation The scenario in which the EU takes over a UN operation was illus- trated in the UN handover to the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was also explored in the EU-UN exercise (EST 05) as one the possible scenarios of EU-UN cooperation. Such an option could be further implemented if the EU had to take over the UN Mission in Kosovo, which may be considered in the short to medium term. Yet, leaving aside this case, the chances that such an option be replicated for a police operation are not very high. Scenario 5: An EU operation deployed simultaneously with a UN operation \u2013 the \u2018stand-by model\u2019 While searching for ways to improve its capacity to react rapidly and efficiently to incidents occurring within operations and jeop- 64 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 39.

        "3 ardising the security of peacekeepers or the implementation of the mandate, the UN elaborated the concept of a \u2018strategic reserve\u2019, 40 that would be \u2018on call\u2019 and able to quickly \u2018respond to dangerously unfolding circumstances\u2019 41 within UN operations. With the same logic and in the context of the EU-UN relation, the UN Secretariat has put forward the concept of a \u2018stand-by model\u2019, that would \u2018consist of an \u2018over-the-horizon reserve\u2019 or an \u2018extrac- tion force\u2019 provided by the EU in support of a UN operation. 42 Through a rapid reaction force deployed in parallel with a given UN operation, the EU would be in a position to support the oper- ation in the case of difficulties encountered on the ground. In a different context, the forces deployed by the United Kingdom in the territorial waters of Sierra Leone following their military intervention in that country in 2000, or the French-led Operation Licorne in Ivory Coast, deployed simultaneously with the UNOCI, can be described as \u2018over-the-horizon\u2019 forces. They both are/were supposed to, among other things, give the UN the rapid reaction capacity that it is lacking. EU member states are very sceptical about such an option. EU documents highlight the \u2018complicated coordination\u2019 that it would involve, and put forward its limited \u2018usability\u2019 as well as the \u2018considerable associated risks\u2019 that it would entail. 43 This scenario would indeed combine two levels of difficulty: one coming from the nature of the mandate that would require adequate military capabilities backed by a strong and lasting political commitment; the other stemming from the simultaneity of deployment with the UN that would need further-reaching coordination mechanisms than the ones currently discussed. Yet EU member states cannot totally rule out such a scenario. Once operational, although not part of their mandate, the battle groups will be formatted for this kind of role. Furthermore, the way Operation Artemis was launched showed how rapidly scenar- ios of EU-UN cooperation can change. As an example, in the event that the UN cannot take over an EU battle group with adequate military capacities (following the \u2018bridging model\u2019 scenario), the maintenance of an EU presence simultaneously with the UN might come close to the concept of an \u2018over-the-horizon\u2019 force. For the time being, the EU has not yet thoroughly investigated nor evaluated the implications of this option in terms of cooperation with the UN. 65 Thierry Tardy 40.

        "3 Scenario 6: An EU component of a UN operation \u2013 the \u2018modu- lar approach\u2019 The sixth scenario of a possible EU-UN cooperation is one in which the EU would contribute to an UN operation by providing one component to the operation (called \u2018modular approach\u2019 in the EU terminology). This option is very much favoured by the UN, which would like to see the EU committed within UN operations and pos- sibly under UN command. Here again, a distinction is to be made between military aspects and civilian aspects of crisis management. In the military sphere, the option of having an EU component within a UN operation is, as seen earlier, not favoured by the EU. However, theoretically, and on the condition that special arrange- ments would be made regarding the chain of command, EU mem- ber states might consider having an \u2018EU-labelled\u2019 component in a UN-led operation. This could give the EU some kind of visibility, or even make national contributions more acceptable to recipient countries, as in a way was the case for Artemis . 44 Although this is not the most likely scenario given EU concerns vis-\u00e0-vis the UN, such an option is not to be excluded in the longer term. Along with the issue of the re-hatting of EU member states assets in a UN operation, the UN Secretariat also invokes the example of the Multinational Stand-by Force High Readiness Brigade for UN Operations (SHIRBRIG) that was deployed in Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2000-01 before the UN took over. The SHIRBRIG is in general available to the UN as part of the UN Standby Arrangement System (UNSAS) and could inspire the EU in its relation with the UN. In his report \u2018In larger freedom\u2019 the UN Secretary-General even talks about memoranda of understanding signed with regional organisations, which would ideally place the \u2018conflict prevention or peacekeeping capacity\u2019 of these institu- tions \u2018within the framework of the United Nations Standby Arrangements System\u2019, 45 a proposal that has little chance of meet- ing EU approval. In the civilian sphere, things are more open, and the option of having an EU component \u2013 police force for example \u2013 in a larger UN operation is there better developed and accepted. And although it is made clear that such civilian elements should remain under the EU \u2018own chain of command\u2019, they may also report to the UN chain of command. 46 The EU also talks about an \u2018integrated and inclusive framework\u2019, as well as about the neces- sity to define \u2018appropriate command arrangements and coordi- 66 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping 44.

        "3 nation requirements including reporting mechanisms and com- patibility of concepts and procedures\u2019, 47 which pushes the poten- tial of EU-UN cooperation much further than in the military sphere. EU assistance in the civilian sphere is very much favoured by the UN, in the context of the project of a UN Standing Civilian Police Capacity, but also regarding the provision of civilian experts by the EU. Finally, along with these main scenarios, the EU could assist the UN (DPKO in particular) at different stages of the launching of an operation (planning and force generation, civilian experts, information, etc.). Looking ahead, together with the necessity to further explore the modalities underlying the above-described sce- narios, issues such as information-sharing and the elaboration of a security agreement, the establishment of permanent liaison offi- cers, compatibility of standards and rules of engagement, as well as financing of operations, will all need to be looked at by the two secretariats and the Steering Committee. In these talks, a twofold effort to (a) look at crisis management as a continuum involving conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and (b) combine military and civilian aspects of crisis management, would allow for a more comprehensive and coherent approach, within both the UN and the EU. Conclusion EU-UN relations in the field of military and civilian crisis manage- ment have come a long way since the first contacts of the year 2000. Both organisations have made significant efforts to make this rela- tionship constructive and achievements tangible. However, such a relationship remains characterised by a form of imbalance that stems from the different agendas of the two organisations. The UN has tried to involve the EU as much as possible in peacekeeping activities \u2013 in Africa in particular \u2013 and is advocating a strong and institutionalised partnership that would not be confined to the subcontracting model and some kind of assistance, but would also allow for direct EU contribution to UN-led operations. While doing this, the UN has always insisted on the complementarity of the two approaches. The EU stance matches other concerns: it acknowledges the need to cooperate at different levels, but favours a more flexible and case-by-case approach, where EU autonomy of 67 Thierry Tardy 47.

EU-UN cooperation in crisis management is recent; the evolving environ- ment in which it takes place constantly creates new opportunities or new incentives to move forward, but also new concerns that may slow down the process. In this respect, two factors will determine the shape the EU-UN relationship in the coming months and years. The first is the out- come of the two processes of the reform of the United Nations on the one hand, the ratification process of the European Constitu- tion on the other. The second is the way the two institutions tackle the security and development challenges with which Africa is con- fronted. 68 EU-UN cooperation in peacekeeping cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 68 ",
        "What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? Jeffrey Laurenti After a decade of ever more sterile debate about \u2018reforming\u2019 the Security Council, the Institute has provocatively recast the issue as one of \u2018 reinforcing \u2019 it. This casts the debate in a decidedly different light, since the explicit question is not simply how to revise the membership and decision-making of this international policy body, but whether tangibly better security may be achieved by put- ting more strength behind the Council. Not all actors in the international community will champion a strengthening of this institution. Some fear enhancing the capac- ity of a distant conclave of the powerful to meddle in their local affairs; others bridle at a supranational institution that may cir- cumscribe the room for manoeuvre of the powerful. Yet \u2018reinforce- ment\u2019 may itself be ambiguous, and its invocation may provide its own invitation to mischief. For reinforcements can come from outside, and if those doing the reinforcing prefer to keep autonomous control of their \u2018reinforcement\u2019, the supposed bene- ficiary may actually become more marginalised and \u2013 dare one say \u2013 irrelevant. Indeed, one of the issues about the Council\u2019s future role is whether decision-making and enforcement will migrate once again, as it did for most of the Cold War, to dedicated power cen- tres that find the global mechanisms, and perhaps the global vision, embodied in the Security Council a source of frustration. Pressures in this direction have been building for a decade, mani- fested in ideologically rooted calls for ad hoc coalitions of the willing, the off-loading of security cooperation to regional groups and unilateral initiatives to maintain international peace and security. Europeans may have thought that NATO\u2019s decision to go to war over Kosovo was a one-shot circumvention of the UN Security Council, but many in Washington celebrated the September 1998 decision in the North Atlantic Council as a momentous step for- ward in weaning Europeans away from their fixation on Charter 69 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism 4 cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 69 ",

And the Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq was all along \u2013 allegedly, of course \u2013 a helpful reinforcement to the Security Council to ensure its resolutions would be respected. The UN Security Council and national sovereignty It is important, therefore, to begin our discussion by asking what it is that really ails the Council, and to consider remedies accordingly. As the Bush administration\u2019s newly nominated UN representa- tive once remarked, \u2018the real issue is the legitimacy of the United Nations\u2019. And he was not talking about the representativeness of the Security Council as the legitimacy problem, but rather the claim (or \u2018pretension\u2019) of the international body to rein in the behaviour of its most sovereign member. Even senior officials of the supposedly friendly Clinton administration took pains to describe the UN as just another wrench in the toolkit for imple- menting its foreign policy goals. Of course, dedicated multilateral- ists might say that forum-shopping for whatever multilateral fig- leaf will cover what you want to do is better than naked unilateralism, but this may be no more significant than American courts\u2019 parsing the distinction between indecency and obscenity. The United States is not the only country that questions the authority that states (or, as the Charter would have us believe, \u2018the peoples of the United Nations\u2019) have conferred on UN institutions to regulate state behaviour in the domain of security; many others are equally vigilant, and often more consistent, in defence of tradi- tional sovereignty \u2013 think of, say, China, Iran or Cuba. But the sov- ereignists in developing countries imagine there is a structural fix to restrain the Security Council\u2019s evolution into meddlesome policeman: just tilt the balance of seats on the Security Council towards the African and Asian groups, and they can curb Western proclivities to enforce \u2018international\u2019 standards on benighted regimes. For these, it is the outsized influence of largely Western power centres in setting the global security agenda that under- mines the \u2018legitimacy\u2019 of the Security Council. To be sure, this complaint reflects a minority view. Unfortu- nately, the supposed remedy resonates in a UN political system where inclusiveness is seen as the answer to almost any problem (although many voting delegates are able to draw the line at includ- ing non-governmental actors). But inclusiveness is a cure for a dif- 70 What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 70 ",

The incentives for major actors to bypass the system altogether if promis- cuous enlargement renders the Council unworkable will be great. This is not just an American problem. To the extent that Europe continues to emerge as a global leader and agenda-setter, Euro- peans, too, have an interest in a Security Council that can decide and then implement. They may well inherit a role that has largely been America\u2019s for the past six decades, and if so they too will forum-shop or bypass altogether a body that has become unwieldy and immobilised. In that respect Europeans, too, might be cau- tious about calls for significant expansion of the Security Council. Decision-making and implementation For what is it that really ails the Security Council? My diagnosis is that the fundamental disorder lies in the disconnect between deci- sion-making and implementation, and especially between the power to decide and the power resources actually committed to implementation. An ossified membership structure and a crudely weighted voting system are aggravating manifestations of the underlying disorder. In contrast to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, whose leading members were prepared as recently as 1999 to go to war to uphold the \u2018credibility\u2019 of a threat they had collectively issued in its name, the United Nations has not been able to count on its mem- bers\u2019 concern for Council credibility to back up their votes with action. It is striking that the permanent members of the Council, after a flurry of activity in UN peace operations in the 1990s, have disappeared from them since the UN Protection Force in Bosnia was converted to a NATO operation in 1996. Initially the allergy to serving under UN command was an American phenomenon (even when Americans ran the UN mis- sion, as in Somalia), but the contagion has spread. Britain and France, which had pioneered major-power leadership of a large- scale UN peace operation in former Yugoslavia, now refuse to put their troops under UN command; even when they have stepped up to reinforce an embattled UN operation, as in Sierra Leone and in Congo and Ivory Coast respectively, they have done so under sepa- rate, national command. Today the Council\u2019s guarantor powers 71 Jeffrey Laurenti cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 71 ",
        "4 have become the absentee landlords of international security, rely- ing on others to supply the troops for missions whose mandates the Five have written. The reasons why military contingents of the Security Council\u2019s permanent members no longer participate in UN peace operations are several, ranging from chauvinist resistance to \u2018foreign\u2019 com- mand and fear of a creeping world government, to concern about unreliable partners and substandard military commanders from developing countries, to military leaders\u2019 distaste for the presumed \u2018peacenik\u2019 culture of the United Nations, where the political restraints on robust use of armed force are believed to be exponen- tially tighter and more paralysing than those set by their civilian national leaders. Many other NATO states have followed the lead of the Western permanent members in keeping a discreet distance from UN peace operations in recent years, leaving countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh, India and Jordan, and Ethiopia and Ghana as the UN\u2019s leading troop contributors. Not surprisingly, the countries still willing to provide troops to UN operations have increasingly clamoured for a share in decision- making on the mandates and goals of the missions their soldiers are implementing \u2013 a demand that arose after moralising Western governments that refused to put their own troops on the ground in Sierra Leone wrote aggressive mandates for peacekeepers there, even though the governments sending many of those peacekeepers were intent on keeping them out of someone else\u2019s civil war. Yet for all the troop contributing countries\u2019 insistence on hav- ing a role in deciding the mandates and objectives of peace opera- tions, they have notably failed to demand that their own regional groups endorse only major troop contributors for their region\u2019s seats on the Security Council. In fact, the Western group is the only regional grouping where a candidate country\u2019s troop contribu- tions ever emerge as a factor in the campaign for election to the Security Council \u2013 and it is noteworthy that, for 2005-2006, even this group is represented by a determined non-performer like Greece and a decidedly virtuous but second-tier contributor like Denmark. The reality is that troop contributing countries have not sought to challenge the entrenched system of regional group rotation on the Security Council. This suggests the difficulty inherent in mak- ing even incremental changes to the procedures governing Security Council membership. Instead, most governments prefer to seek 72 What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 72 ",
        "4 the Holy Grail of a far-reaching overhaul, hoping that expansion may painlessly satisfy national ambitions and contributors\u2019 griev- ances. To that end, member states have been consumed by a pro- tracted debate in the famously open-ended working group on reform of the Security Council, which has been as long-running a show in New York as any musical on Broadway. The long path to reform Though it has not exactly drawn crowds to the galleries of the Gen- eral Assembly, within a six-block radius of United Nations head- quarters and in some interested foreign ministries the debate on Security Council reform is all-consuming. Nothing, it seems, brings out the repressed interior designer in the hearts of diplo- mats as much as discussion of rearranging the furniture in the Security Council chamber. But this is definitely a political insider\u2019s game. The issue inspires yawns among most of the informed pub- lic and even in a normally opinionated press. Moreover, the working group on Security Council reform may be open-ended, but it is not particularly open. It has never solicited the views of non-governmental organisations that regularly inter- act with the Council, such as the humanitarian relief agencies that sometimes deploy more people to conflict-torn countries than the UN itself does, about the dysfunctions they observe in the Coun- cil\u2019s structure and changes that could improve its performance. The wider public is totally disengaged, except for narrow networks in a handful of countries where foreign ministries have invested heavily in promoting their own membership \u2013 or blocking some- one else\u2019s \u2013 as a matter of national pride. Security Council reform has, of course, been a battle cry since the Council itself shook off its four decades of Cold War slumber and came to life as a nerve centre of international politics. And the clashes of national ambitions over the dozen years since the Clin- ton administration\u2019s embrace of reform helped launch the open- ended debate in 1993 remain apparently irreconcilable. Indeed, the conventional wisdom among most jaundiced UN observers is that the chances of Security Council revision in the foreseeable future are little better than zero. That is too despairing a judgment, though bookmakers would probably not lose money by putting odds on continued paralysis. 73 Jeffrey Laurenti cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 73 ",
        "4 The Secretary-General clearly wanted the High-Level Panel on global security to address this issue head-on in the hope of break- ing the log-jam, and the Panel exceeded the realists\u2019 expectations in fashioning an almost compelling case for Security Council reform. With great delicacy, the Panel hinted at the deformity at the heart of the Council\u2019s eroding credibility, along the lines of the cri- tique advanced in this chapter: \u2018the ability of the five permanent members to keep critical issues of peace and security off the Secu- rity Council\u2019s agenda\u2019. Given its membership and its avowed inten- tion to come up with a package that could be adopted within a year, the Panel prudently declined to focus on problems that cannot be fixed in 2005. Rather, it moved smartly to spell out the principles that its members agreed should guide Council reform in the near term: (1) \u2018greater involvement . . . by those who contribute most\u2019; (2) making it \u2018more representative . . . of the developing world\u2019; (3) \u2018not impair the effectiveness of the Security Council\u2019 (normally understood as code for keeping the Council relatively small); and (4) \u2018increase the democratic and accountable nature of the body\u2019. The Panel then offered two models for revision, one that flows from the logic of these four criteria (though falling short on crite- rion 3), and another \u2013 inserted after protests from relevant govern- ments \u2013 that arguably meets criterion 2 and, perhaps transiently, 1. The debate, inevitably, has focused on whether more heavy- weight contributors from each region should be added through permanent seats or longer-term elected seats, and the implica- tions of that choice are profound. But with the Panel\u2019s far- sighted recommendation for a mandatory revisiting of the Council\u2019s composition in 2020, ways may be envisioned to square that circle. Both alternatives reported by the Panel would expand the num- ber of major contributors to peace and security on the Council. This is not an objective shared by many representatives of small states in the UN, especially in the developing world, who are in adamant denial of the premise that size matters. The size of mem- bers\u2019 contributions to peace and security (enshrined in Art. 23 but often ignored, especially in African rotation) is not the only such fundamental issue, however. Size also matters in terms of a politi- cal body\u2019s efficiency, especially a body faced with an exploding 74 What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 74 ",
        "4 security crisis \u2013 and the Panel\u2019s call for enlargement of the Security Council to 24 will seem promiscuous to those governments that have arduously had to build Council coalitions for robust action. They have a major stake in keeping the Council numbers down. Membership expansion A highly motivated group of countries has energetically sought to fashion a plan that wins the required 127 votes for adoption in the General Assembly. This involves delicate compromises and, like many dazzling feats of legislative engineering, bridges across policy gaps that may be built on hazy rather than solid foundations. Four countries have, at the time of writing, submitted a draft \u2018framework resolution\u2019 endorsing, in principle, the addition of permanent seats \u2013 drawing on the High-Level Panel\u2019s Model A \u2013 for a Council of 25. This moves suggests the sponsors \u2013 Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan \u2013 believe they have at last found the formula that can obtain the necessary 127 votes, as required by Art. 108 of the UN Charter. But, like salmon swimming upstream to spawn, the supporters of this revision must leap a number of other obstacles in their way after the test vote in the Assembly on a framework resolution. The second obstacle is the regional caucuses that would then select the actual names of states to engrave in the UN Charter; the four spon- soring states may not all be guaranteed selection in their region, and unwelcome surprises in the regional caucuses could weaken support for the ultimate Charter amendment. Beyond that, 127 governments \u2013 including all five of the 1945 permanent members \u2013 must then ratify the Charter amendment. The Americans have already made clear that the United States will not ratify an amendment that adds to the number of veto- wielding permanent members. This is a problem, not only because both the lead sponsors of the proposal themselves bristle at second- rate permanency, but because a veto for newly permanent African members is specifically the condition for Africans\u2019 support of the resolution. African representatives are innately suspicious of power and privilege, and would normally be quick to deflate any pretensions, whether among their own or outsiders, to claim per- manent privilege as the entitlement of overweening economic or military power. They have been brought around to supporting per- 75 Jeffrey Laurenti cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 75 ",
        "4 manent seats by the lure of African vetoes to block American initia- tives, which they believe is the only leverage they will ever have to force increased attention from an indifferent superpower to African security problems. In this they may be wrong: Washington \u2013 and probably Europe as well \u2013 would almost certainly circumvent UN frameworks if a veto by an objectively impotent African coun- try thwarts the will to act of a hard-won majority of the Security Council. Still, the complete marginalisation of the Security Coun- cil would not be ideal for Washington, and Americans will stand firm to save the Security Council from the paralysis of proliferating vetoes. By stating unambiguously that it will accept no revision that provides additional vetoes, the United States has set out one of its red lines. Another red line is the size of the expansion itself \u2013 not only because 25 is in principle too many for Washington, but because any expansion of that magnitude will inevitably make the vote of at least one or two African and Asian members indispensable for approval of any resolution. The regional distribution of seats within the existing 15-member Council allows for the required 9- vote working majority to be formed just from countries in Europe and the Americas. It was precisely such a majority that approved the UN sanctions against Libya in 1992 \u2013 a resolution on which every African and Asian member of the Council abstained. The United States has little reason to concede to countries congenitally suspi- cious of Western values and purposes a choke-hold on resolute action by the Security Council. The fact is that the United States has no compelling self-interest in promoting any alternative to the existing composition of the Council. The current size of 15 is already on the high end for an effective executive committee, and the existing inner directorate of five may include some occasionally difficult partners but is of a realistic size. Indeed, it can be convenient, on issues where Wash- ington cannot build a majority for its policies, to blame failure on a prospective French or Chinese veto to justify marginalising the Council. America\u2019s reigning conservatives might wish to give Japan the permanent seat that France now holds, which the currently chimerical call for a single \u2018EU\u2019 seat might permit, but even they realise that their ideal reform \u2013 reducing the number of permanent members, preferably to one \u2013 is not achievable. For Washington today, Security Council reform is someone else\u2019s problem, and its seeming passivity masks purpose. 76 What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 76 ",
        "4 The United States is not the only country of weight that is pre- pared to stonewall a Council revision that is not carefully tailored to meet its practical objections. Another permanent member has also finally tipped its hand on its red line: the apparently intense Chinese opposition to Japan\u2019s bid for a permanent seat. It is not clear whether the Chinese government\u2019s resistance is genuinely rooted in the historical evasiveness of Japanese officialdom regard- ing wartime responsibility, their refusal to pay war reparations, and the apparent continuing dominance of Japanese politics by the conservative political class that had launched the war (all of which may factor into the nationalist animosity towards Japan among the Chinese public), or whether it aims simply to raise the price of a deal. But the intensity of public hostility, on view in the April demonstrations in several Chinese cities, may abort any cunning strategy to extort a high price from Tokyo in exchange for acquies- cence to a Japanese permanent seat. Of course, Japan is the only candidate country that Americans believe actually deserves a per- manent seat based on the merits, given its outsized share of the world economy and UN assessments (both now on a downward tra- jectory), to say nothing of the \u2018I owe you\u2019(s) that the Koizumi gov- ernment has accumulated thanks to its loyal support of Bush administration policies; Beijing\u2019s unyielding stance against Japan would drain what little interest Washington can muster in expan- sion of permanent membership. The European Union and the future of UNSC reform In terms of self-interest it does not really matter much to Euro- peans whether Japan becomes a permanent fixture at the Council table or not \u2013 they do not expect Tokyo to relieve them of their cur- rent troop or financing burdens. Europeans are famously frag- mented, however, on whether adding a permanent seat for the European Union\u2019s largest member is desirable. Britain and France have a strong incentive to bring Germany into the Council\u2019s inner circle: if left outside, the Germans will surely press for a consoli- dated EU seat at the expense of separate British and French per- manent seats, but if they gain their own permanent seat, the British and French can feel secure in retaining theirs in perpetuity. The prospect of a \u2018G-3\u2019 motor driving EU foreign policy, enshrined by permanency in the UN Security Council, pleases some and dis- 77 Jeffrey Laurenti cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 77 ",
        "4 mays others elsewhere in the Union. The normally fractious Ital- ians are uncharacteristically united and feisty in opposing perma- nency (including Germany). Their views are not shared by every member of the EU, but they have invested notable energy in build- ing alliances with partners in every region to keep Model A from leaving the station. Thus, while American passivity on the Council reform project reflects Washington\u2019s lack of passion, Europe\u2019s mutually cancelling passions on the subject have produced EU passivity. The United Nations is notoriously the place where, in defiance of the laws of physics, inertia can develop momentum. Already warning signs of the UN membership\u2019s traditional immobilism on this issue are beginning to appear. If the coalition that Japan and Germany have so painstakingly assembled to put them across the top ultimately falters, it will not be for lack of imagination on the part of their diplomats, but because of the inherent contradictions of permanent membership: it is very hard to satisfy all the national ambitions for a permanent place in the inner circle and have a man- ageably sized Council \u2013 much less a Council that is, in the Panel\u2019s words, \u2018democratic and accountable\u2019 from the perspective of either the regional groupings or the full UN membership. The biggest inherent contradiction, of course, is that perma- nence eliminates a member\u2019s incentive to perform \u2013 even more in the universe of states than in that of tenured university faculty. We have seen that the states most securely implanted on the Security Council have been the most visible non-contributors of troops to UN peace operations, and there is nothing in the various plans for expansion of permanent membership that would tie their seats to their contribution to security operations. (It is no coincidence that the two permanent members that spent much of the 1990s show- ily supporting UN peace operations with troops on the ground were the two European members that felt their permanent status, after being shorn of their 1945 empires, was most under attack.) Conversely, a number of major states outside the Permanent Five have viewed contributions of personnel to international security operations as evidence of their global indispensability and of the need to include them in decision-making circles (think of Brazil, Germany, India, Italy and Pakistan). It would be perverse if the unintended consequence of expanding the ranks of permanent members were to be a further shrinkage in the pool of major con- tributors. 78 What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 78 ",
        "4 Given these difficulties, if \u2018Plan A\u2019 fails, can \u2013 or should \u2013 Coun- cil reform still be salvaged? Kofi Annan\u2019s High-Level Panel offered two recommendations in this arena that could be the key. The first is its insistence that any revision now would be only an interim solution, with a mandatory re-examination in 2020 (a \u2018sunset\u2019 clause could make such a re-examination truly compulsory). Now, \u20182020\u2019 connotes clarity of vision, and we may well see some prob- lems that are today politically untouchable as realistic possibilities for resolution two decades hence. The EU common security and defence policy enshrined in the draft European constitution is at the moment still more speculative than real, but two decades of habit may make separate privileged seats on the Security Council for Britain and France seem quaint and obsolete \u2013 even in London and Paris, where by the 2020s the experience of European and global politics of nearly all the diplomats and politicians who will then be in office will have been forged post-Maastricht. If, ideally, the main international disputes are resolved in the next decade or two, the veto power could then be reconsidered, and that decisive contribution of Josef Stalin to the Council\u2019s structure might be rationalised. It thus becomes eminently realistic to fix 2020 as the year for making a long-term reform of what really ails the Security Council, and to treat the 2005 measure as a short-time patch. The second relevant recommendation of the High-Level Panel that could point the way to a \u2018fallback\u2019 reform is the interim struc- ture outlined in Model B \u2013 seats reserved for major contributors to peace and security in each region, elected to longer terms (say, four or five years) and eligible for successive re-election. The Panel help- fully offered a list of quantifiable criteria for determining which states in each region might be eligible for these longer-term seats (criteria that would be equally relevant to identifying members that might claim seats without election, so long as they continued as their region\u2019s leader). This model could be further modified to allow a region to fill its new seat for a single 15-year term \u2013 the full life-span of the interim arrangement \u2013 giving the most uncontestedly important contribu- tors the opportunity to rehearse de facto permanency without pre- judging the eventual reconfiguration of the Council two decades hence. The other modification to Model B that would seem desirable, to meet the Panel\u2019s own criterion of effectiveness, is to limit the size of the interim Security Council to the 20 that the United States had 79 Jeffrey Laurenti cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 79 ",
        "4 signalled in 1997 was the most it could accept. \u201820 till 2020\u2019 can make eminent sense: we would have nearly two decades to see whether a more limited expansion adversely affects the Council\u2019s efficient decision-making in a crisis; and the results would help guide agreement on the long-term reform in the 2020s. What none of the plans floated in the current Security Council debate addresses is the most crucial reinforcement that the inter- national security system needs: concrete commitments of forces callable by the Council in a crisis. This too will clearly have to await the major overhaul of the 2020s, since the current debate has pro- ceeded too far down the road of furniture rearrangement to get back to the basics. But it is not too soon to put out the marker for the 2020 revision: every member state assuming a seat on the Secu- rity Council, whether by election or by entitlement based on extraordinary contributions, could (and should) be required dur- ing that state\u2019s tenure as a member to commit appropriately deter- mined military units to a rapid deployment force capability under the authority of the Council. Only its vote in Council against a pro- posed deployment would exempt a member\u2019s pre-committed con- tingent from short-term call-up. Such a linkage of decision-making to implementation, of course, could be accomplished even with the existing Council com- position. It would make far more of a dent in what ails the Council than all the furniture renovations in the Council chamber on which various expansion plans are premised. This is the \u2018reinforce- ment\u2019 that the Security Council most desperately needs. Whatever the short-term \u2018fix\u2019 may be regarding membership that 127 mem- ber states can agree on and the existing permanent members will ratify, it is clear that they will not act now on the hard questions of capacity. Reinforced capacity is an area where a uniting Europe can make a decisive contribution. It can begin immediately by launching the international debate on what military commitments should be required (\u2018from each according to his ability\u2019) for Council member- ship after 2020; after all, ambitious projects easily take 15 years or more in international consensus-building. The EU could consider \u2013 and, even more boldly, initiate \u2013 creation of an international standing force dedicated to UN peace operations, recruited from within and beyond its borders and financed in part from the UN reimbursements on their deployment. This would provide the United Nations with the kind of visionary leadership that for much 80 What \u2018reinforcement\u2019 for the Security Council? cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 80 ",

But much of this, most particularly in the area of security, has been ad hoc and haphazard. The challenge of the next decade is to replace this improvised, polit- ically selective, resource-skewed approach to regionalism with a more planned, consistent yet flexible, resource-balanced style of regional and global governance which would find the adequate synergy between regional organisations and the United Nations. 1 For this to occur, a tension within the present security system will need to be resolved. In July 2003 the UN Secretary-General advanced a \u2018vision\u2019 of global security based on a future partnership between the UN and regional organisations \u2013 one that would be effective, holistic and global in nature, emphasising the concept of legitimacy that can come \u2018only from the United Nations\u2019. 2 Progress towards such a \u2018regional-global security mechanism\u2019, however, is impeded by the endemic shortcomings of the current system. In 2005 the debate is under way over how best to respond to this crisis of confidence in collective security. Issues such as reaffirm- ing and refining the rules of the use of force, the rights of self- defence in an age of terrorism and possible WMD proliferation, expansion and reform of the Security Council, and the institu- tional means of making peace-building and human rights protec- tion more effective \u2013 all are on the agenda. Where regional organi- sations fit into this future scenario remains uncertain. But the debate on their role in partnership with the UN will be carried in the 6th UN-Regional Organisations High-Level Meeting in July, the 60th anniversary summit debate of the General Assembly in September and the third Security Council meeting with regional cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 83 ",

The next six months are thus critical to strengthening the partnership between the UN and regional and other intergovernmental organisations in peace and security. Regionalism under construction: developing a \u2018regional- global security mechanism\u2019 A structured relationship between the Security Council and regional organisations is fundamental to the success of a future global-regional security mechanism. The development of a \u2018regional-global security mechanism\u2019 in the multilateral era is best understood as having comprised three distinct periods: shaping the constitutional relationship (1919-45); building the institu- tional network (1946-92); and developing a framework for cooper- ation (1992-2004). The constitutional, institutional and coopera- tion phases in the development of the mechanism bring us to the present time \u2013 a fourth \u2018moment of opportunity\u2019. The constitutional phase The fundamental relationship between universalism and region- alism in security doctrine was shaped during the two formative moments of institutional planning \u2013 1919 and 1942-45. The deliberations over the League of Nations and the UN laid the foundations for the present system. In one sense the security arrangement embodied by the League was, to some extent, an essentially regional affair, being wrought in the aftermath of the Great War in Europe and designed to prevent any repetition thereof \u2013 with the same approach being applicable to Latin Amer- ica. Overall, however, regionalism played no significant role in the League\u2019s attempts at conflict resolution and management, ill- fated as they were. In the early planning for a new world organisation during the Second World War, the issue of \u2018security regionalism\u2019 became a matter of dispute. The preliminary outline of an \u2018interim UN\u2019 envisaged 26 member states, with an Executive Committee of nine, comprising the Big Four which had \u2018policing duties\u2019 (United States, United Kingdom, USSR and China) and five \u2018regional rep- resentatives\u2019. The regional nature of the Committee, however, was opposed by a majority in the US planning team, and the outline 84 Regional organisations and collective security: the role of the European Union cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 84 ",
        "5 was dropped. The principle of regionalism was at various times \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019 of subsequent planning, and at the San Francisco Con- ference of May 1945 the choice between regionalism and univer- salism proved controversial. Most delegations, led by the Latin American bloc and the Arab states, with support from Britain and its commonwealth and also the USSR, favoured regionalism, but the United States remained steadfastly opposed. The resulting compromise, contained in Chapters VII and VIII of the UN Char- ter, proved to be critical. The final provisions agreed upon in the Charter reflect what has been called a \u2018mild discouragement\u2019 of regionalism. The Char- ter allows for regional security arrangements for the maintenance of peace and security as a support to the primary role exercised by the Security Council. Nothing is to preclude the existence of regional agencies for dealing with international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided they are compati- ble with its purposes and principles. But this was not provided for through any prefabricated mechanism. Instead, the Charter made provision for a vaguely apprehended regionalism, with regional agencies or arrangements encouraged to take initiatives in pacific settlement of disputes but with enforcement only to be under- taken on the authorisation of the Council. The institutional phase The forty-year period of the Cold War paralysed the functional operation of the Security Council and thus the development of any regional-global security mechanism. It was during this period, however, that the decolonisation process occurred, accompanied by the growth of regional agencies in virtually all regions of the world. The 1940s saw their establishment in the two regions where the political consciousness of \u2018regionalism\u2019 was most developed at that time \u2013 Latin America and the Arab world \u2013 the most vocal pro- ponents of regional security during the \u2018constitutional phase\u2019. This was followed in the 1950s with a burst of unparalleled creativity in regional institution-building in Europe. The process of regionalisation continued ineluctably through the ensuing three decades. Once the decolonisation process had run its course in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and the Caribbean and the Pacific in the 1970s, supplemented by \u2018latecomers\u2019 in the 1980s and the newly independent states of Eastern Europe and 85 Kennedy Graham with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 85 ",
        "5 Central Asia in the 1990s, a global network of regional and subre- gional agencies was finally in place. The cooperation phase Concomitantly with the development of the global \u2018fabric of peace\u2019 developed during the 1990s, the UN began to act on the recogni- tion of the potential for greater involvement of regional agencies in a cooperative relationship with the UN in the pursuit of interna- tional security. A series of meetings have been held since the mid- 1990s designed to develop a strategic partnership between the global body and the regional agencies. It is clear that the UN is seri- ous in seeking to develop a \u2018regional-global security mechanism\u2019 for the twenty-first century. Two phenomena in particular charac- terise to date the experience in strategic planning for that goal: increased interest from the \u2018regionals\u2019 themselves and the develop- ment of a normative framework between them and the UN. Accordingly, five high-level meetings between the UN and regional organisations were convened by the Secretary-General to discuss issues of cooperation in peace and security between 1994 and 2003. These efforts have resulted in a \u2018Framework of Co-operation\u2019 between the UN and regional organisations with guiding princi- ples for collaboration in conflict prevention and peace-building. A sixth meeting is scheduled for July 2005. Important initiatives are under way in preparation for this meeting to strengthen the UN- RO partnership. 3 Two special meetings with regional organisations have also been held by the Security Council. At the first, in April 2003, only six organisations attended (AU, ECOWAS, EU, LAS, OSCE and OAS) under the theme \u2018The Security Council and Regional Organi- zations: Facing New Challenges to International Peace and Secu- rity\u2019. The objective of the meeting was to engender an \u2018interactive dialogue\u2019 between the Council and regional organisations, mark- ing perhaps a \u2018new stage\u2019 in international relations, since the cur- rent situation then prevailing obliged the Council to identify courses of action that would strengthen international security. The second meeting took place in July 2004 under Romanian presi- dency, this time with the aim of identifying new methods of coop- eration between the UN and regional organisations and develop- ing innovative approaches to conflict resolution and stabilisation processes. This meeting was attended by seven international organ- 86 Regional organisations and collective security: the role of the European Union 3. In preparation for the 6th UN- RO High-Level Meeting; sched- uled for July 2005 at the United Nations in New York, six working groups have prepared back- ground papers on six thematic subjects with proposals for adop- tion by the UN Secretary-General and heads of regional and other intergovernmental organisations. A secretariat has been created within the UN\u2019s Department of Political Affairs to ensure sound preparation and effective follow- up on decisions taken. The secre- tariat is supported by research and advisory services of the UN University\u2019s Programme in Com- parative Integration Studies (UNU-CRIS). cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 86 ",
        "5 isations (AU, CIS, EU, LAS, NATO, OSCE and ECOWAS) and a Presidential Statement was produced. The Council concluded that regular dialogue on specific issues between it and regional organi- sations would bring \u2018significant added value\u2019 to UN-regional coop- eration for peace and security, based on \u2018complementarity and comparative advantage\u2019. A third meeting is planned for October 2005, to build further upon these initiatives and emerge perhaps with a Council resolution that will commence a serious momen- tum for introducing a viable operational partnership. Thus, the Security Council has rather belatedly \u2013 a decade after the Secretary- General took the initiative \u2013 begun to develop a relationship with the regional and subregional organisations that is focusing on the range of peace and security challenges \u2013 counter-terrorism, conflict prevention and management, and peace-building. Complexities of regionalism The development of the regional-global security mechanism is hampered by an array of complexities. These pertain to uncertain- ties over the meaning of the central concepts of \u2018region\u2019, \u2018agency\u2019 and \u2018arrangement\u2019; the structural duplication of regional agencies and other organisations (involving overlapping of membership); contention over the area of application of their functions; and ambiguity over their objectives (involving, inter alia , improvised and occasionally competing mandates). The UN Charter does not define \u2018region\u2019, its framers having decided, after much fruitless effort, against any self-restricting ordinance of that kind. A definition advanced by Egypt during the San Francisco Conference, however, gives as good a conceptual notion as is perhaps necessary: There shall be considered, as regional arrangements, organisa- tions of a permanent nature, grouping in a given geographical area several countries which, by reason of their proximity, com- munity of interests or cultural, linguistic, historical or spiritual affinities make themselves jointly responsible for the peaceful settlement of any disputes which may arise. The membership of regional agencies and similar organisations is bewilderingly complex, as an analysis of regional economic com- 87 Kennedy Graham with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 87 ",
        "5 missions, regional integration bodies and electoral groupings at the UN reveals. This begs the question of what constitutes a \u2018region\u2019 and indeed, what is a truly meaningful concept of \u2018region\u2019. It is, in this respect, difficult to posit the most appropriate and authoritative departure-point for gaining clarity over geographical regionality. The area of application of a regional agency or other interna- tional organisation has also become contentious. The phenome- non in recent years of some organisations operating \u2018out-of-area\u2019 in a \u2018hard security\u2019 function has caused some political controversy but the United Nations appears to be willing for the present to recognise such operations as not only legitimate but welcome. This issue is linked to both membership and mandate. It raises first the question of whether it is appropriate, in a constitutional sense, for a \u2018regional agency\u2019 under Chapter VIII to operate outside the national territories of its own regional members. An analysis of the same organisations also shows overlapping mandates of those that seek to \u2018partner\u2019 with the UN in peace and security, inferred from their statutory objectives. The question of mandate of regional arrangements and agencies is problematic \u2013 some pertain to economic issues, some to security and some to broader political and cultural \u2018identity\u2019 purposes. The evolution of regional and other organisations has thus given rise to some unusual developments regarding mandates. Some organisations have experienced \u2018mandate creep\u2019 through force of circumstance, entering the field of peace and security from the vantage point of an economic mandate. Others have taken on what might be called \u2018mandate crab\u2019, ranging laterally across geographic space and extending their focal areas. A few have undertaken \u2018mandate stray\u2019 \u2013 effectively exceeding their constitutional authority in certain cases beyond the confines of the UN Charter. There is a need for greater clarity and order in the matter of mandates in the regional- global mechanism for peace and security. There thus exists a rather confusing admixture of regional and subregional agencies, with different membership, statutory man- dates in peace and security, and other organisations with qualita- tively different mandates, all assembling together for meetings with the United Nations over the maintenance of international peace and security. This invites institutional confusion; indeed it almost institutionalises that confusion in a divided world. The international community faces a \u2018strategic choice\u2019 with regard to the relationship between universalism and regionalism. 88 Regional organisations and collective security: the role of the European Union cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 88 ",
        "5 A partnership has been built up between the United Nations and other international organisations in the name of regionalism but that relationship is complex, informal and constitutionally inver- tebrate. The choice is between two future courses. The United Nations can continue with \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 in which several score entities partner with it but with little clear sense of common direction. Or it can commence the process of clarifying, and to some extent formalising, the relationship with a view to making it more effective. The potential role of the EU in a future collective security system In the above analysis the question arises of where the European Union fits in. In the post-Cold War period \u2013 the past decade and a half \u2013 the EU has come into existence, initiated moves towards a constitution and a common foreign and security policy, and expressed the intention to become a \u2018global actor\u2019 in international affairs. Such an aspiration is redolent of the centuries-old Euro- pean dream, resting on the vision of a united continent asserting itself to enlightened effect on the world stage. The manner in which the EU perceives the Iraq and other crises, and the prescriptions it offers for a collective international order, has become a closely watched factor of international politics. What might be called the first \u2018strategic policy\u2019 of the EU, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis the UN and multilateralism, is spelt out in two documents of 2003: the EC Communication \u2018The European Union and the United Nations: the choice of multilateralism\u2019 of 10 September and the European Security Strategy adopted by the European Council three months later. These two documents are proving seminal in the annals of EU foreign policy development. The EU\u2019s overarching \u2018strategic objective\u2019 is the strengthening of an international order based on \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019. The \u2018fundamental framework\u2019 for international relations remains the UN Charter. The challenge accepted by the EU is to help the mul- tilateral system deliver on its key objectives. Two aspects of its con- tribution to effective multilateralism could, the EU believes, be further developed: its ability to act as a \u2018front-runner\u2019 in develop- ing multilateralism; and its support for capacity-building in other countries and regions. 4 89 Kennedy Graham with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio 4. \u2018The EU should adopt a deter- mined \u201cfront-runner\u201d approach to the negotiation and implemen- tation of important UN initiatives in the fields of sustainable devel- opment, poverty reduction, and international security, taking a more proactive approach to the development of international in- struments and specific EU imple- menting actions. Moreover, the EU should give renewed impetus to the UN reform\u2019. \u2018The European Union and the United Nations: the choice of multilateralism\u2019, EC Communication COM(2003), 526, 10 September 2003, p. 9. cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 89 ",
        "5 The EU has moved with speed and determination to imple- ment its policy of \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019. The relationship between the EU and the United Nations as partners in crisis man- agement is characterised by far-reaching potential yet also by for- midable challenges. Four dimensions to the relationship can be discerned: doctrinal, operational, institutional and political. Each needs to be addressed of itself yet all are interrelated, thereby pos- ing a major policy test for EU leaders and officials over the next decade. Doctrinal dimension The interrelated crises of Afghanistan, Iraq, North Korea and Iran have placed strain on a number of cardinal principles of traditional security doctrine contained in the UN Charter. In various ways each one of the contentious policy issues identified earlier has tested the unity of EU policy-making. 5 The major policy split, how- ever, has emerged in the past two years in response to the United States\u2019s unilateralist policy over Iraq. The pre-emptive use of force in March 2003, without Security Council authorisation, divided the major member states, particularly France and Germany vis-\u00e0- vis the United Kingdom. Of perhaps greatest embarrassment to the EU, the \u2018unreasonable veto\u2019 theory was generated in response to a threatened French (and Russian) veto against Security Council authorisation of force. And the regime change of the Iraqi govern- ment (universally recognised at the UN for the previous two decades despite its use of WMDs) was undertaken without any offi- cial querying of the legality of such a move. Operational dimension It is often contended that Europe has been slow to develop an oper- ational capability in crisis management. Yet it should be recalled that, only a decade ago at the time of the Balkans crisis, the EU did not even exist as an entity. The EC\u2019s capacity to undertake an oper- ational deployment in the Balkans was, inevitably, seriously lim- ited. In the past five years the EU has begun to develop its opera- tional capability, and this is starting to show practical results in the field. Recently the UN has recognised the far-reaching potential of relying on a more active, capable and coherent EU as an operational partner committed to \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019.

Plans for EU-UN cooperation have been thoroughly implemented in the past two years. Effective contact between the two secretariats com- menced with DPKO officials on peacekeeping in May 2001. Since April 2002 the UN-DSG has led an annual mission to Brussels. The EU Military Staff has identified UN-DPKO as its UN partner, and the EU Policy Unit has identified UN-DPA (Europe branch). Joint task forces have been established to coordinate interaction over police and military missions, and foster training, with a \u2018steering committee\u2019 now meeting biannually. Liaison offices have been strengthened in New York and Brussels. It is clear that, as far as the UN is concerned, the EU is in business as a \u2018global actor\u2019. Institutional dimension: the EU as a regional agency? The status of international organisations vis-\u00e0-vis Chapter VIII remains imprecise and uncertain. This raises the question whether the EU is to be regarded as a regional agency under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter. A number of issues require consideration. At the 5th UN-RO High-Level Meeting in 2003 some 21 organ- isations participated, yet only seven were true regional agencies while the rest were subregional, cross-regional or transnational. The manner in which an international organisation is to be desig- nated as a \u2018Chapter VIII regional agency\u2019 has yet to be determined. Two agencies (OAS, OSCE) have proclaimed themselves to be a \u2018regional agency for the purposes of Chapter VIII of the UN Char- ter\u2019. For its part, NATO does not see itself as a \u2018Chapter VIII regional agency\u2019 but that believes that it \u2018acts in the same spirit\u2019. 6 Nor in fact does the EU consider itself to be a Chapter VIII regional arrangement or agency. 7 The distinction between being a regional agency under Chap- ter VIII of the UN Charter or not carries little significance at pres- ent. Any international organisation, whether subregional (ECOWAS), regional (OAS), cross-regional (NATO) or transna- tional (Commonwealth), may be called upon by the Security Council for pacific settlement activities and, as appropriate, for enforcement of the Council\u2019s decisions, acting under Chapters VI and VII respectively. But as the UN increasingly relies on partner organisations to share in the maintenance of peace and security, the distinction between a regional agency under Chapter VIII and 91 Kennedy Graham with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio 6.

        "5 others acting under Chapters VI and VII may become more impor- tant. A future arrangement in which designated \u2018Chapter VIII regional agencies\u2019 represent agreed \u2018security regions\u2019 could be envisaged, whereby such agencies assume an institutional role (for instance, representation and reporting) and an executive role for pacific settlement. Enforcement could be undertaken by either a \u2018Chapter VIII regional agency\u2019 or any other international organisa- tion, as appropriate. The EU might thus act, in its sui generis capac- ity, in peacekeeping under Chapter VI, enforcement under Chap- ter VII and peace-building under Chapter IX. Political dimension All in all, it seems that the EU is not to be seen as a \u2018Chapter VIII regional agency\u2019 but rather as a sui generis organisation \u2013 operating on a plane above the nation-state but not yet, and perhaps never, a single supranational entity. 8 The EU lacks the single-minded polit- ical coherence of the United States and also the dedicated military capability of the superpower. But its loosely aggregated European citizenry is larger than that of its North American partner, and its combined diplomatic skills and \u2018soft power\u2019 are already formidable and generally welcomed around the world as a potential force for good. To the extent that the UN is moving towards \u2018soft power\u2019 as the principal default mode for crisis management, the EU is taking shape as the single most valuable operational partner of the UN. This development is attracting interest, and even excitement, within the UN itself, as witnessed by the frequency of visits to Brus- sels by the UN leadership, and also within the wider policy commu- nity beyond. 92 Regional organisations and collective security: the role of the European Union 8. \u2018[The EU] is not a State in- tended to replace existing states, but it is more than any other inter- national organisation.

        "Conclusion UN reform: as necessary as it is difficult Martin Ortega The preceding chapters show that there is a lot to be done to improve global governance through the United Nations. The world has changed dramatically since 1945, when this organisation was created, and it is imperative to reach global consensus to modernise the United Nations so that it can make a more decisive contribu- tion to tackling today\u2019s challenges. However, looking at the situa- tion in June 2005, one has the impression that the debate on UN reform that will take place during the 60th General Assembly this September will not bear substantial fruit. Some progress is foresee- able in areas such as development and the creation of a Peace Build- ing Commission, but overall the agreed changes in the United Nations will most probably be low-key. The United States govern- ment is not willing to exercise any leadership on this front, the EU member states are in disarray, taking care of their own problems, the developing countries are putting forward certain demands that the others deem unacceptable, UN member states are divided on the key issue of Security Council reform, and, in his report \u2018In larger freedom\u2019 (March 2005), the UN Secretary-General has opted for a \u2018minimalist\u2019 approach, trying to attract agreement on a few issues that do not really imply the revamping that the organisation badly needs. The reform of global order requires a \u2018constitutional momen- tum\u2019, which, unfortunately, is not present today owing to the pre- vailing political circumstances. Indeed, such \u2018constitutional momentum\u2019 appears only rarely in history, and is usually linked to serious crises or extraordinary developments. This momentum existed, in particular, after the First and Second World Wars, and led to the creation of the League of Nations and the United Nations respectively. In a different environment, a significant con- stitutional change in the international order took place at the beginning of the 1990s \u2013 although it did not entail formal modifi- cation of the UN Charter. The end of the Cold War and Saddam Hussein\u2019s aggression against Kuwait triggered an unprecedented 93 The European Union and the United Nations \u2013 Partners in effective multilateralism 6 cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 93 ",
        "6 consensus amongst the five UNSC permanent members that led to effective action by the Security Council. For the first time since its creation, this body decided to authorise large (and later, smaller) uses of force, to make substantive pronouncements on certain international conflicts and disputes, and to mandate peacekeeping operations. Also, in a peaceful environment, a regional \u2018constitutional momentum\u2019 has existed in Europe in the last few years. It is true that this impetus has stalled after the French and Dutch referendums on the draft European constitu- tion, but nothing excludes a continuation of the European consti- tutional process under different conditions in the future. A similar \u2018momentum\u2019 is not detectable at global level today. And yet, global threats, risks and challenges call for immediate and concerted action. \u2018In a world of global threats, global markets and global media\u2019, to replicate the words of the European Security Strategy, we do not have the proper global institutions. Individual states continue to take the lead in the resolution of the world\u2019s problems. But the main task of governments within states is to advance the interests of their own citizens, not to look after \u2018global interests\u2019. When governments decide to cooperate, some global challenges can be tackled; if they choose not to cooperate, those challenges continue to fester on. The \u2018reaction gap\u2019 that exists between alarming global problems and the available institutions has been eloquently described by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rischard in his book High noon, 20 global issues, 20 years to solve them . 1 Rischard, the World Bank\u2019s vice-president for Europe, wrote in 2002: The most important and urgent global problems . . . have two things in common: They\u2019re getting worse, not better, and the standard strategies for dealing with them are woefully inade- quate to the task. The real problem, in other words, is that in our increasingly crowded, interconnected world, we don\u2019t have an effective way of addressing the problems such a world creates. Our difficulties belong to the future, but our means of solving them belong to the past. The EU and its member states could have an important role in finding imaginative solutions to this undesirable situation. In fact, they have declared that \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019, \u2018well func- tioning international institutions and a rule-based international order\u2019, as well as \u2018strengthening the United Nations, equipping it 94 Conclusion - UN reform: as necessary as it is difficult 1.

        "6 to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively\u2019 are their priori- ties. However, when it comes to putting into practice these declared objectives, the Europeans are hesitant. As was pointed out in the introduction to this Chaillot Paper , UN reform perhaps is both too much and too soon for the European Union. Governments have not promoted a public debate on UN reform in Europe. This issue has been mainly confined to a technical exchange amongst diplomats and has not received much attention from parliaments and politicians. One cannot find many references to UN reform in the conclusions of EU foreign ministers\u2019 meetings or the Euro- pean Council. Points of agreement and disagreement During the preparation of the 60th General Assembly, through permanent contacts in New York, Brussels and elsewhere, the 25 EU member states have indeed reached agreement on a number of issues, but they continue to diverge on others. Let us examine points of agreement and disagreement amongst the Europeans fol- lowing the check list provided by the President of the UN General Assembly in his first \u2018draft outcome document\u2019, dated 3 June 2005, for the 60th Anniversary High-Level Meeting, where he sum- marises items at the centre of UN member states\u2019 discussions within four clusters: development, peace and security, human rights and the rule of law, and strengthening the United Nations (meaning reform). The EU members basically agree on the objective of increasing development assistance to 0.5 per cent of GDP by 2009 and 0.7 per cent by 2015. Also, they support initiatives \u2013 some of them already mentioned in the UN Secretary-General\u2019s report of March 2005 \u2013 to alleviate debt, give priority to Africa, fight against AIDS and other infectious diseases, rethink the role of women in develop- ment, continue to work for the protection of the environment, and look for additional sources of financing for development. On the second cluster, the EU members jointly endorse the establishment of a Peace Building Commission, in order to ensure that post-conflict reconstruction efforts in war-torn countries are durable and coordinated. Various UN documents acknowledge the EU contribution to UN peacekeeping and capability building, and more EU-UN cooperation in this field is to be expected. Other 95 Martin Ortega cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 95 ",
        "6 proposals in the peace and security area are also agreeable to the Europeans: enhance the fight against terrorism and WMD prolif- eration and disarmament, explore and refine targeted sanctions, assign to the Secretary-General better resources to utilise his good offices in international disputes, and recognise the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 in the event of genocide or massive violations of human rights, defining criteria for humanitarian intervention. As regards proposals related to human rights, the EU members support in principle the creation of a Human Rights Council; however, they are divided on whether this new body should be linked to the General Assembly or to the Security Council, whether the creation of such a council should entail UN Charter reform or not, whether a \u2018peer review mechanism\u2019 of respect for human rights in UN member states should be implemented, and what the role of NGOs in the new body should be. Finally, proposed formal changes in the UN Charter are very modest, and EU members have not yet made up their mind on this aspect. It seems that both the Trusteeship Council and the refer- ences to the \u2018enemy states\u2019 in the Charter will be removed, but it is less clear that provisions on the Military Staff Committee will dis- appear. The UN General Assembly\u2019s agenda will be streamlined and the status of ECOSOC will be enhanced, and annual meetings at ministerial level might be planned with European backing. The EU member states would equally support a reinforcement of the UN Secretariat. The most striking source of disagreement amongst Europeans, however, is reform of the Security Council. Even if there is consensus amongst the EU member states on other issues, their lack of a common position on UNSC reform will be perceived as a failure of the EU common foreign and security polity. In order to make an overall assessment of European attitudes towards UN reform, one should take into account that the various initiatives mentioned so far belong to three different categories: (a) UN member states\u2019 action (for instance, increase development aid, measures to fight WMD proliferation and advance WMD dis- armament); (b) improve the UN\u2019s working methods (for instance, streamlining the General Assembly\u2019s agenda and reinforcing the UN Secretariat); and (c) changes in the UN Charter. While the EU member states are united on most of the issues pertaining to cate- gories (a) and (b), they are conspicuously divided on crucial aspects of UN Charter reform. 96 Conclusion - UN reform: as necessary as it is difficult cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 96 ",
        "6 Disappointment Nevertheless, beyond the specific points of agreement and dis- agreement amongst Europeans, the real question is: will the Euro- pean input to the negotiations lead to a reform of the United Nations that \u2018strengthens\u2019 the organisation and \u2018equips it to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively\u2019? The answer is a fatalistic \u2018no\u2019. Initiatives listed below represent a \u2018lowest common denomi- nator\u2019 arrived at before the 60th anniversary summit. This denom- inator accords poorly with the EU\u2019s ambitious proclamations about effective multilateralism and the global order. In the absence of American interest \u2013 as a result of the current US government\u2019s attitudes towards the UN \u2013 the European Union and its member states are not in a position to have a decisive impact on the reform process. And yet, bearing in mind its contri- bution to the UN and its collective stance and prestige, the EU had the means to exert a positive influence in the forthcoming reform. The EU could have acted as an \u2018honest broker\u2019 between a reluctant United States and a Third World majority, could have tried to include democracy and human rights at the centre of UN action, could have introduced protection of the environment as one of the key objectives of the global order, could have insisted on recogni- tion of the role of regional organisations, and ultimately could have engaged most UN members in the creation of a new United Nations with the necessary resources to fulfil its vital missions. In various degrees, the preceding chapters of this Chaillot Paper share the same general sentiment of disappointment vis-\u00e0-vis the European role in the current UN reform process. They contain more demands than both the EU and the European governments seem able to take on. Let us summarise their conclusions and claims: (cid:90) Global Public Goods, development and security . In his chapter, Sven Biscop affirms that the EU should promote policies that ensure better access to \u2018Global Public Goods\u2019 (physical security, politi- cal participation, development, health services, education and a clean environment) for everyone. In his view, a \u2018positive agenda\u2019 \u2013 not just an agenda focused on threats \u2013 should inspire the EU\u2019s contribution to UN reform. Bearing in mind the causal link that exists between poor economic, social and cultural conditions and security, he proposes to pay more attention to the Millen- 97 Martin Ortega cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 97 ",
        "6 nium Development Goals, and to give the ECOSOC an \u2018enhanced profile\u2019. True, the European Union is committed to increasing its assistance to developing countries, to poverty reduction and debt relief, but, as Biscop points out, this com- mitment has yet to materialise and has to be consistent with the EU\u2019s external trade policies. (cid:90) Human rights and protection of the environment . Francesco Fran- cioni analyses these two crucial issues and puts forward a series of useful recommendations for the EU and its member states. Regarding human rights, he suggests three lines of action: \u2018streamlining\u2019 of the present UN system of human rights sur- veillance and implementation; \u2018mainstreaming\u2019, or systemati- cally incorporating human rights in all UN policies and actions; and \u2018entrenching\u2019, i.e. reaffirming the intrinsic value of human rights at a time of globalisation. On the other hand, protection of the environment should be a distinct European priority. Francioni presents two options. Protection of the environment could be ensured globally either through a reform of existing schemes, and most notably the United Nations Environmental Programme, or via the creation of a new, independent global environmental organisation, an option which he slightly favours. Again, all these proposals are more daring than the ideas contained in EU documents and in the UN Secretary-Gen- eral\u2019s report of March 2005 \u2013 perhaps excepting the creation of a Human Rights Council. (cid:90) Peacekeeping . In his chapter, Thierry Tardy explains how EU-UN cooperation for peacekeeping purposes has been increasing steadily since the year 2000. Although direct participation of European military and civilian personnel in UN-led operations is not very high, the Europeans have an important contribution to make to UN peacekeeping through financing, \u2018enabling capa- bilities\u2019 and dialogue and cooperation between politico-military authorities in Brussels and New York. Since Operation Artemis in summer 2003 and the joint EU-UN declaration of 24 Septem- ber 2003, the EU has defined a number of scenarios: for instance, the scenario where a EU-led operation receives UNSC authorisa- tion and the \u2018bridging model\u2019 scenario, or a rapidly deployed EU operation that allows the UN to mount an operation of its own. However, as Tardy points out, the problem is that, given the dif- ferent EU and UN agendas, UN \u2018demand\u2019 does not always find a positive response on the part of the EU. 98 Conclusion - UN reform: as necessary as it is difficult cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 98 ",
        "6 (cid:90) S ecurity Council reform . Far from presenting grand proposals, Jef- frey Laurenti adopts a realistic approach, which leads him to conclude that UNSC enlargement is highly unlikely. Opposi- tion to candidates to new permanent members from current permanent members (especially, China vis-\u00e0-vis Japan), and from regional powers (for instance, Argentina, Italy, Pakistan \u2013 who would oppose Brazil, Germany and India respectively) will make it impossible, in Laurenti\u2019s opinion, to reach the required two-thirds majority, including all permanent members, to approve UN Charter reform. The United States is comfortably watching those neighbourhood disputes, as it is not enthusias- tic about UNSC enlargement. Laurenti suggests, thus, that instead of \u2018rearranging the furniture in the Security Council chamber\u2019 some more pragmatic measures could be adopted with a view to implementing its decisions effectively and rein- forcing the Council\u2019s capabilities. En passant, he points out that, due to divisions within the EU on UNSC reform, \u2018Europe\u2019s mutually cancelling passions on the subject have produced EU passivity\u2019. (cid:90) The EU, regional organisations and collective security . The last chapter makes a plea for the deeper involvement of regional organisa- tions in collective security. Kennedy Graham (writing with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio) suggests that regional organisations have acquired such an important role in conflict prevention and cri- sis management that the forthcoming reform will encounter the following dilemma: either to continue with \u2018business as usual\u2019 or commence the process of formalising the relationship between the UN and regional organisations with a view to mak- ing it more effective. The issue is not, however, a formal recogni- tion of the EU as a \u2018Chapter VIII regional organisation\u2019, for the EU is actually acting as such an organisation; rather, the issue is whether the EU is ready to lead a debate about the role of regional organisations in collective security. Three conclusions Three main conclusions can be drawn from the preceding analysis. Firstly, the relations between the EU and the United Nations pres- ent a mixed balance sheet. On the one hand, the EU and its member states share a common language and common objectives with the 99 Martin Ortega cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 99 ",
        "6 United Nations. The EU is cooperating with the UN on a whole range of issues: development, human rights, protection of the envi- ronment, peacekeeping, etc. This \u2018commonality\u2019 applies to all 25 EU members, including first and foremost the two UNSC perma- nent members. The same cannot be said of other UNSC permanent members, who are less involved in either respect for human rights or peacekeeping or protection of the environment or all of them. On the other hand, however, the Europeans have not had great influence during the preparation of the debate on UN reform that will take place from September 2005. In other words, while day-to- day EU-UN cooperation is working efficiently, the EU and its mem- ber states have failed to seize the symbolic opportunity of the 60th anniversary to define a common vision for the future of the organ- isation. The Europeans have the ideas and the means; what is lack- ing is self-confidence, leadership and determination. Secondly, irrespective of other changes in the UN that can be supported by the Europeans, reform of the Security Council will be the most important issue, both in the public perception and historically. Unfortunately, the EU member states have aligned themselves along global fracture lines instead of trying to define an intra-European consensus. There are at least four European points of view on this issue: (a) Germany has presented its candi- dature as new permanent member; (b) France and the United Kingdom have supported the 4 + 1 new permanent members option \u2013 i.e. Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, plus an African candi- date; (c) Italy and Spain \u2013 along with other states such as Argentina, Pakistan, Republic of Korea \u2013 oppose the prospect of new permanent members; and (d) other EU member states \u2013 as well as the European Parliament \u2013 believe that the EU\u2019s efforts should be targeted at creating a single EU seat in the future. Although it seems perhaps too late to reach an agreement amongst the Europeans, it is worth trying. The EU and its member states should not reproduce divisions that are present in other con- tinents, but should rather try to find ways to break the deadlock in UNSC reform. Enlargement of this body is needed in order to enhance its perceived legitimacy. If none the less UNSC enlarge- ment is eventually delayed owing to lack of global agreement dur- ing the 60th anniversary UN summit, the EU and its member states should start thinking afresh on this issue in the coming years. Finally, while most of the current recommendations regarding UN reinforcement and reform are laudable, the main problem 100 Conclusion - UN reform: as necessary as it is difficult cc78-Text.qxp 12/07/2005 14:34 Page 100 ",
        "6 continues to be lack of resources, and this is not sufficiently underlined in the present debate. Bearing in mind the broad range of tasks, particularly peacekeeping, that the United Nations has to carry out worldwide, the UN is clearly underfunded. In 2003, for instance, the assessed UN budget for regular activities was US$1,409 million and the peacekeeping operations budget was $2,260 million. Since $1,507 million were unpaid ($441 million from the regular budget, $1,066 million from the peacekeeping budget), the UN functioned with $2,162 million that year. 2 By way of comparison, the 25 EU members combined defence expendi- ture amounted to $166.64 billion in 2003 \u2013 whereas the United States spent $404.9 billion. In order to strengthen the United Nations, its human and financial resources must be augmented, and the EU and its member states, which already pay a large share of the UN budget, should be ready to meet this challenge. 101 Martin Ortega 2.

        "This Chaillot Paper offers some ideas on how the European Union and its member states can contribute to the reform of the United Nations, a theme that will be high on the agenda during the celebration of the UN\u2019s 60th anniversary in autumn 2005. Five experts write on the following subjects: security and development (Sven Biscop), human rights and protection of the environment (Francesco Francioni), peacekeeping (Thierry Tardy), UN Security Council reform (Jeffrey Laurenti) and regional organisations and collective security (Kennedy Graham with T\u00e2nia Fel\u00edcio). A conclusion draws some lessons from the various chapters and suggests that the EU should be more involved in the UN reform process. Relations between the EU and the United Nations present a mixed balance sheet. On the one hand, the EU and its member states share a common language and common objectives with the United Nations. The EU is actively cooperating with the UN on a whole range of issues: development, human rights, protection of the environment and peacekeeping, amongst others. On the other hand, however, the EU and its member states have failed to seize the symbolic opportunity of the 60th anniversary to define a common vision for the future of the organisation. More specifically, instead of negotiating a com- mon position on UN Security Council enlargement \u2013 one of the key issues \u2013 the Europeans have shown profound divisions.
