        "E. whereas the fiscal consolidation policies being pursued by Member States are primarily affecting the public sector, in which women are represented more strongly and of which they are the main beneficiaries, and are thus causing harm in two ways, and whereas these policies are making employment more insecure, not least because of the increase in the instance of part-time working (32 % among women compared with 8,2 % among men) and temporary contracts, and not to mention wage reductions; F. whereas there are more women than men living in poverty and exclusion, especially older women, whose average pension level is 39 % lower than that of men, and single mothers; whereas, for family reasons, it is more common for women rather than men to work part time or under fixed-term or temporary contracts, and whereas women\u2019s poverty is due largely to the precariousness of their jobs; G. whereas combating poverty is one of the Commission\u2019s five measurable targets proposed under the Europe 2020 strategy; whereas Integrated Guideline 10 of the Europe 2020 strategy (promoting social inclusion and combating poverty) could prompt the adoption of national policies to protect women, in particular, from the risk of poverty, ensuring income security for one-parent families and elderly women; H. whereas the falling birth rate in the EU has been exacerbated by the crisis, given that unemployment, precarious circumstances and uncertainty about the future and the economy are making couples, and younger women in particular, delay having children, thereby further reinforcing the EU-wide trend towards population ageing; I. whereas the existing taxation systems in certain Member States are predicated on a narrow view of the family to the extent that they are biased towards families in which only one of the two parents is working inasmuch as, in many cases, they deter women from working and fail to provide sufficient support to single-parent families, large families and families supporting dependent relatives; J. whereas although women account for almost 60 % of graduates in the EU, their representation in senior official and decision-making positions is disproportionately low, and the proportion of EU scientists and engineers who are female is less than 33 %, while women make up almost 80 % of the workforce in the health, education and welfare sectors; K. whereas there is a strong horizontal segregation or gender-specific division of labour, with almost half of women in employment being concentrated in 10 of the 130 occupations listed in the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) drawn up by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and only 16 % of workers holding jobs in sectors with an equal proportion of men and women; L. whereas the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for 99 % of European companies and provide two out of three private-sector jobs, is crucial to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth; whereas only 31 % of entrepreneurs in the EU are women; whereas the rate of entrepreneurship among women in the EU is 10 %, as compared with 19 % among men; whereas there is a need to promote and support the increase of entrepreneurship among women; M. whereas approximately 42 % of those regularly involved in agriculture in the EU are women, and 3 in 10 farms in Europe are run by women; whereas promoting equal opportunities for men and women and, at the same time, involving women to a greater extent in business and society, especially in agriculture, must be matters of ongoing concern in Europe; N. whereas the female employment rate is 63 %; whereas the gender gap in pay stands at 16,4 %; whereas 73 % of the members serving in national parliaments are men, and whereas women make up 17,8 % of the membership of large company boards and every week spend three times as long as men on household chores (e.g. caring for children, elderly people and people with disabilities and performing household tasks); O. whereas 37 % of the Members of the newly elected European Parliament, 9 out of the 28 new Commissioners and 7 out of the 28 judges at the Court of Justice of the European Union are women; C 316/6 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2016 Tuesday 10 March 2015 ",
        "P. whereas the female unemployment rate is underestimated given the fact that many women are not registered as unemployed, particularly those who live in rural or remote areas, along with many of those who devote themselves exclusively to household tasks and childcare; whereas this situation also creates a disparity in terms of access to public services (benefits, a pension, maternity leave, sick leave, access to social security, etc.); Q. whereas if the present trends continue, the target of 75 % of women in employment will not be reached until 2038 and equal pay will not become a reality before 2084; whereas equal representation in national parliaments, in the EU institutions and on European company boards could be achieved by 2034, but whereas it would take until 2054 before housework was shared equally; R. whereas the failure to promote policies providing for a work-life balance in general and the lack of affordable and high- quality childcare facilities and assistance services for the elderly and people requiring special care, in particular, pose a major obstacle to women\u2019s economic independence and their rise to positions of responsibility, and to the equal participation of women and men in the labour market, including as a means of preventing and reducing poverty; S. whereas the sharing of family and domestic responsibilities between men and women, to be brought about not least through a greater uptake of parental leave and paternity leave, is essential in order to achieve gender equality; whereas a quarter of Member States do not offer paternity leave; T. whereas traditional gender roles and stereotypes continue to have a strong influence on the division of roles between women and men in the home, in the workplace and in society at large, thereby limiting women\u2019s range of employment choices and their personal and professional development, thereby impeding them from realising their full potential as individuals and as economic players; U. whereas the media can play a role, on the one hand, in spreading stereotypes, degrading the image of women and over- sexualising young girls and, on the other hand, in overcoming gender stereotypes, encouraging women\u2019s participation in decision making and promoting gender equality; V. whereas the Council has still not responded officially to two legislative resolutions adopted by Parliament on key aspects of gender equality, namely its resolutions of 20 October 2010 on the proposed maternity leave directive and 20 November 2013 on the proposal for a directive on gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges and related measures; W. whereas in its report of 6 December 2013 on the application of Directive 2006/54/EC, the Commission raised questions concerning 26 Member States on the conformity of their national legislation with the directive\u2019s new provisions ( 1 ); X. whereas, according to the FRA survey of March 2014, one in three women in the EU has been physically and/or sexually assaulted, while one in five has suffered physical violence after the age of 15 and almost one in two has experienced psychological violence; whereas violence against women constitutes a breach of fundamental rights which bears potentially serious psychological consequences, affects all levels of society, regardless of age, education, income, social position and country of origin or residence, and is one of the least reported crimes; whereas violence against women is one of the main obstacles to true equality between women and men; Y. whereas violence against women and girls on the internet is on the rise, with the behaviour of minors on social networks proving to be exceptionally worrying in this regard; Z. whereas the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings will end in 2016; whereas, according to the 2014 Eurostat report on trafficking in human beings, the vast majority (80 %) of registered victims of trafficking in the EU are women and girls; 30.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 316/7 Tuesday 10 March 2015 ( 1 ) Report on the application of Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast) (COM(2013)0861). ",
        "AA. whereas six Member States have still not signed the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) and only eight have ratified it; AB. whereas gathering comparable accurate data, broken down by sex, is particularly important for public policy-making at national and EU level, especially where violence against women is concerned; AC. whereas women have specific health issues and are less often than men the subjects in clinical trials, and these differences have important implications for women\u2019s health; AD. whereas girls and women, especially those aged between 15 and 24, are less involved than boys and men in physical activity, and whereas sport is a means of self-expression and fulfilment, as well as a force for citizenship and solidarity, and the regular practice of sport improves physical and mental health; whereas violence against women, stereotyping, differences in pay and barriers to women\u2019s involvement in management can all be found in sport; AE. whereas sexual and reproductive rights are fundamental human rights and should be taken into account in the EU\u2019s action programme in the field of health; AF. whereas the formulation and implementation of policies on sexual and reproductive health and rights is a competence of the Member States; AG. whereas the Commission\u2019s annual report on gender equality is a vital tool for gauging developments in the situation of women in Europe; Equality between women and men in the Europe 2020 framework 1. Calls for the EU institutions and the Member States to mainstream the issues of gender, women\u2019s rights and equal opportunities in their policy making, budget procedures and the implementation of EU programmes and activities, by means of pro-active measures, especially in connection with stimulus packages, by carrying out gender impact analyses on a case-by-case basis; 2. Deplores the fact that the \u2018Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015\u2019 will soon fail to hit its targets, especially as regards economic independence, in part because of the withdrawal of the proposal for a maternity leave directive; stresses, at the same time, that economic differences between men and women have been gradually increasing; 3. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to integrate a gender pillar into the Europe 2020 strategy to measure progress on reducing the gender gap in employment and in order to bring about the transfer of policy measures in the Annual Growth Survey into the country-specific recommendations (CSRs); 4. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop a general plan for investment into social infrastructure, as it has been estimated that with a gendered investment plan, European gross domestic product (GDP) would increase gradually, by 2,4 % more by 2018 than without such an investment plan; 5. Notes that equal participation by women and men in the labour market could significantly increase the economic potential of the EU, while confirming its fair and inclusive nature; points out that, according to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projections, total convergence in participation rates would result in a 12,4 % increase in GDP per capita by 2030; C 316/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.8.2016 Tuesday 10 March 2015 ",
        "6. Maintains that poverty among women, and older women and single mothers in particular, but also women who are victims of gender-based violence, women with disabilities, migrant women and women from minorities, needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency; calls on the Member States, therefore, to implement more effective inclusion strategies and make more efficient use of social policy resources, not least the European Social Fund and the Structural Funds; 7. Finds it regrettable that the effectiveness of social policies in reducing poverty fell by almost 50 % in 2012 compared with 2005 in homes with just one adult, a situation which includes most widows and single mothers; is also concerned that the effectiveness of the social policies implemented in certain Member States amounts to only one third of the European average; calls, therefore, on Member States to strengthen social policies which target in particular the unemployed, in order to tackle rising poverty, especially among women; 8. Calls on the Council and the Commission to address the gender dimension of poverty and social exclusion; finds it regrettable that the CSRs adopted so far as part of the annual European Semester cycles have not been sufficiently aligned with the Europe 2020 employment and social targets; calls for CSRs systemically to address the structural causes of female poverty; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to allow for changes in the family unit when drawing up their taxation and compensation policies, in particular by providing support to one-parent families and older people in the form of tax credits or health care assistance; 10. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to ensure that equality between men and women and the integration of the gender perspective be taken into account in cohesion policy funds and promoted throughout the preparation and implementation thereof and in its programmes, including as regards monitoring, reporting and evaluation; 11. Considers it unfortunate that the annual report now ranks only as a working document annexed to the report on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and urges the Commission to restore the full political legitimacy of the annual report by having it officially adopted in its own right; Equality between women and men in employment and decision-making 12. Points to the imperative need to reduce gender gaps in pay and pension also by addressing the persistent concentration of women in part-time, low-pay and precarious work and by securing care facilities of a sufficient quality for children and other dependents; deplores in the strongest possible terms the fact that more than a third of older women in the EU receive no form of pension; urges the Member States to give full effect to the rights provided for under Directive 2006/54/EC, including the principle of equal pay and pay transparency, and to revise their national laws on equal treatment with a view to the simplification and modernisation thereof; calls on the Commission to keep the transposition of gender equality directives under regular review and invites the Commission to propose a recast of Directive 2006/54/EC as soon as possible, in accordance with Article 32 thereof and on the basis of Article 157 TFEU, following the detailed recommendations set out in the annex to Parliament\u2019s resolution of 24 May 2012; 13. Deplores in the strongest possible terms the fact that women do not receive the same salary in cases where they hold the same jobs as men or jobs of equal value, and condemns, equally, both horizontal and vertical segregation; emphasises, furthermore, the fact that the vast majority of low salaries and almost all very low salaries are paid for part-time work and points out that about 80 % of the working poor are women; points out that according to the European Added Value Assessment conclusions, a decrease of one percentage point in the gender gap in pay would bring about an increase of 0,1 % in economic growth, which means that it is crucially important to close the gap that exists in the current economic downturn; calls, therefore, on the Member States, employers and trade union movements to draft and implement serviceable, specific job evaluation tools to help determine work of equal value and thus ensure equal pay between men and women; 30.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 316/9 Tuesday 10 March 2015 ",
        "14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement proactive policies to promote good jobs for women in order to meet the Europe 2020 targets by combating stereotypes and vertical and horizontal occupational segregation, encouraging the transition from part- to full-time work, and focusing in particular on the not-in-education-employment-or- training (NEET) category; calls on the Member States to set specific employment targets in the framework of their national reform programmes to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to access and stay in the labour market; 15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement proactive policies to encourage women to embrace careers in science and to promote, through information and awareness-raising campaigns in particular, entry by women into sectors traditionally viewed as \u2018male\u2019, notably the sciences and new technologies, with a view to benefiting fully from the human capital represented by European women; stresses, in particular, that information and communications technology (ICT) offers new opportunities and calls upon the Commission to ensure that gender be fully mainstreamed in the priority accorded to the digital agenda in the next five years; 16. Stresses that financial independence is a key means of securing equality and that entrepreneurship among women constitutes an underestimated and underexploited potential for growth and competitiveness in the EU; calls, therefore, on the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) to collect more and better data on entrepreneurship among women; calls on the Member States, the Commission, other relevant bodies, such as chambers of commerce, and industry to encourage, promote and support entrepreneurship among women by facilitating access to credit, cutting red tape and other obstacles to start-ups by women, mainstreaming a gender perspective in the relevant policies, promoting the creation of a single multilingual electronic data and exchange platform for women social entrepreneurs, and supporting regional and Europe- wide mentoring and peer-to-peer networks; 17.
