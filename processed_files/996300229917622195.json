        "1 Executive Summary Projected demographic changes to 2060 at EU27 level point to a contraction in the size of the young population by 9% and in the working-age population (15- 64 years) by 15%; furthermore, a dramatic increase (+79%) in the number of elderly people is expected. The increasing proportion of older people and decreasing proportion of people of working age in the whole population will have social, economic and budgetary repercussions; labour supply and employment will shrink, challenging economic growth, while the demand for services by the ageing population will rise. These trends, although not affecting all regions across Europe evenly, call for a common European strategy for active ageing \u2018 creating more opportunities for older people to continue working, to stay healthy longer and to continue to contribute to society in other ways\u2019. The challenges associated with ageing need to be turned into opportunities for increased labour participation and productivity, job creation in health and social services, and the creation of new markets, generating a \u2018silver economy\u2019 that encompasses a broad range of economic activities from health and care products and services, to mobility and ambient assisted living, i.e. one that is not limited to specific social market segments. In this report, the impact of population ageing is analysed with respect to five main policy areas: employment, access to social services, mobility and accessibility of transport, adapted housing and social inclusion. Part I provides an overview of the main trends in demographic changes (Chapter 1) and within each policy area (Chapters 2 to 6), in both quantitative and qualitative terms; it highlights, wherever these are available, medium to long- term projections and major challenges likely to be faced by local and regional authorities (LRAs). The European and national level is analysed and regional data have been used as extensively as possible to demonstrate heterogeneity across Europe. Since IT availability and penetration may be, or may become, a barrier within each of the policy areas considered, Chapter 7 highlights the role ICT plays with regard to the five policy areas under examination. Part II focuses on solutions adopted at local and regional level to address ageing-related challenges. Firstly, a typology of regions is outlined so as to create clusters with similar features in respect of some key characteristics (Chapter 8), namely: (i) growth and innovation (Navarro et al ., 2008), divided into three categories: high/average/low; (ii) old age dependency ratio (Eurostat data), whether above or below the EU average; (iii) population crude growth ",
        "2 rate (Eurostat data), whether positive or negative; and (iv) prevalence of urban vs. rural population (EU methodology, derived from OECD methodology). According to these indicators, seven types of region have been outlined, ranging from those with strong economic growth, a growing population and a relatively low old age dependency ratio, to those with poor economic conditions, and declining and ageing populations. Secondly, some 35 examples of solutions adopted by LRAs, collated through a bibliographic search, are presented (Chapter 9). For each example, the challenges addressed, governance structure and funding sources are outlined. Finally, on the basis of the typology and the examples compiled, an overview of local and regional solutions is given and conclusions drawn on a possible correlation between types of region on the one hand, and prevailing solutions on the other (Chapter 10). There is evidence that a demographic dimension to regional and local policy is being developed, as processes of demographic change need to be increasingly taken into account in territorial development, regardless of the type of region involved. Furthermore, even if demographic changes have a cross-sectoral impact, they are most often addressed through sector-specific strategies. The social inclusion of elderly people is a policy area where no significant differences have been noted among the different types of regions in terms of initiatives undertaken. Similarly, all regions, including those with a relatively low old age dependency ratio, look for ICT-based solutions for the delivery of health and long-term care services. Regions with dynamic economic growth (types 1 and 2) more frequently implement business innovation and services that mainstream initiatives, tackling efficiency through the integration of processes and partnerships. Regions with old and declining populations (types 5 and 6) place efforts to keep older workers in the labour market high on their agenda, as do regions belonging to type 7, even though, in their case, scarce labour supply is often due to economic migration. Adapted housing schemes are often implemented within integrated business and community models where the provision of housing goes together with the provision of services. In a few cases houses are rented out at special rates tailored to the financial capacities of tenants, thus making the schemes more socially-oriented than business-oriented. Regions with extensive rural areas (in particular type 4) have particular challenges to face and their measures are often part of a wider framework for regional economic development. In general it has been noted that ICT plays an important role in all of the five policy areas that are the focus of this report, as it facilitates adult learning and life-long learning, provides access to eServices, is the backbone of home automation, supports innovation in mobility and may prevent social exclusion if initiatives are undertaken to reduce the digital divide between generations. Also, ",
        "3 the social divide within the older generation needs to be taken into account if equal opportunities for improving quality of life are to be made available to everyone and not just to a few. ",

        "7 1. Introduction 1.1. Population ageing: overview Population ageing is not a new phenomenon in Europe; data clearly show that significant increases have occurred since the 1990s, both in terms of population median age and the share of people aged 65 or over (Charts 1 and 2). Chart 1 \u2013 Median age of population, in years, 1990 and change 1990 to 2009 Chart 2 \u2013 Percentage change in the share of the population aged 65 years or over between 1990 and 2009 Source: Eurostat Population structure and ageing statistics. Source: Eurostat Population structure and ageing statistics. According to EUROPOP2008 projections 1 , this ageing trend is expected to continue in the next decades as a result of developments in fertility, life expectancy and total net migration. Overall: (a) EU population size is not expected to vary much between now and 2060 (+2% change); but (b) the EU population age structure is projected to change substantially. In particular, population ageing is expected to occur in all EU Member States (MS) as a consequence of the existing population structure, lower levels of fertility vs. replacement, and steadily rising life expectancy (Chart 3). 1 These population projections refer to a \u2018convergence scenario\u2019 where demographic values are conceptually considered to converge over the long-term as a result of decreasing socio-economic and cultural differences between Member States. The convergence year has been assumed to be 2150. Details on assumptions made for the three demographic components considered in these projections (fertility, mortality and migration) are provided by the European Commission (DG ECFIN) and the Economic Policy Committee (AWG), 2008. ",
        "8 The highest increases in population median age are anticipated in several new MS such as Slovakia, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Malta and Hungary; Spain, Greece and Portugal will also experience significant increases, reaching levels well above the EU27 average, while the populations in Italy and Germany will continue their current ageing trends. Table 1 provides an overview of projected changes to 2060 in population size and age structure. The following main trends can be observed: (i) the size of the young population is expected to contract by 9% at EU27 level, with major reductions taking place in the new MS and Germany; (ii) the size of the working-age population (15-64 years) is expected to contract by 15% at EU27 level, with 20 countries having negative rates; reductions are once more higher and above the European average in the new MS, as well as in Germany, Greece and Italy; and (iii) the elderly (65+) age group is projected to dramatically increase at EU27 level (+79%), with increases being more evenly distributed between EU15 and EU12 countries; the highest percentage changes are expected in Cyprus, Ireland, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Malta, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic.

        "10 The increasing share of older people and decreasing share of working-age people in the overall population have social, economic and budgetary repercussions (B.1). Public authorities are urged to make available and/or deliver more/higher quality services to their ageing population while financing health care and pensions for a growing number of people, a situation whose sustainability is increasingly challenged by the current economic crisis; they will also face a decrease in labour supply and employment with a consequent overall negative impact on economic growth. Europe\u2019s strategy for facing these ageing challenges points, among other things, to the need for reforms to pension, healthcare and long-term care systems and for steps to boost employment, in particular by \u2018 helping and encouraging the ageing baby-boomers to stay in the labour market rather than retire early, as previous generations have tended to do \u2019 (European Commission, 2009). 2 Hence, the call for \u2018active ageing\u2019, aimed at \u2018 creating more opportunities for older people to continue working, to stay healthy longer and to continue to contribute to society in other ways\u2019 (DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, 2010), and at transforming ageing challenges into opportunities for: increased labour participation and thus productivity; job creation in health and social services delivery; and the development of new products and innovative services with the consequent opening up of new markets (B.2). Additionally, within the Europe 2020 Strategy, ageing should also provide opportunities for \u2018 increasing social, economic and territorial cohesion \u2019 (Committee of the Regions, 2010). 2 The baby-boomer generation encompasses those born in the years 1945-1964, and now reaching their retirement age. ",
        "11 \u2018 Recent analysis confirms that there is a window of opportunity \u2013 a period of about ten years during which labour forces will continue to increase \u2013 for implementing the structural reforms needed by ageing societies \u2019 (European Commission, 2009). It is with this window of opportunity in mind that \u2018the European Year for Active Ageing 2012\u2019 was proposed, with a view to contributing to the momentum for necessary reforms and measures. B.1 Age-related expenditure In 2009, age-related expenditure projections (2008 \u2013 2060) by the Economic Policy Committee were released for the EU27 and subsequently endorsed by the ECOFIN Council. Such projections, based on the EUROPOP demographic projections produced by Eurostat in 2008 and on a series of macroeconomic assumptions and projection methodologies, refer to five main expenditure items: pensions, health care, long-term care, education, and unemployment. The main findings of the EPC were: (i) declining working- age population and progressively reduced net migration over the projected period will entail a decrease in labour supply and employment, with an overall negative impact on economic growth; (ii) age-related public expenditure is expected to increase substantially at EU27 level (GDP growth of 4.7% by 2060), especially with regard to pensions (GDP growth of 2.4 %), health care (GDP growth of 1.5%) and long-term care (GDP growth of 1.1%), although a large variation is expected among MS. In particular, the increase in public spending is expected to be: very significant for Luxembourg, Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and Ireland, with GDP growth of 7% or more; significant for Belgium, Finland, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Hungary, with GDP growth between 4 and 7%; and moderate for Bulgaria, Sweden, Portugal, Austria, France, Denmark, Italy, Latvia, Estonia and Poland, with GDP growth of 4% or less.

        "12 B.2 The \u2018Silver Economy\u2019 The ageing of the European population could become an opportunity for growth, as older people may generate demand for products and services; but while the burdens associated with population ageing are well reported, the economic potential and investment opportunities that may arise from this phenomenon are less so. Since 2005, the SEN@ER - Silver Economy Network of European Regions was established upon the joint initiative of European regions and under the leadership of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. In Germany, research had forecasted \u2018 more than 900,000 employees in the \u2018silver economy\u2019 within the next two decades \u2019, and for North Rhine-Westphalia in particular \u2018 around 100,000 new jobs by 2010\u2026 \u2019 (Ferry M., Vironen H., 2010), increasing its tax revenue by over 1.2 billion EUR by the same year. The SEN@ER network \u2018 regards the ageing of our society not as a threat but rather as a challenge and an opportunity for regional economic growth and for improving Europe's competitiveness\u2019 and promotes \u2018 the development and marketing of innovative products and services aimed at this new market segment, thereby contributing to regional development and job creation \u2019 (SEN@ER website). Overall, the term \u2018silver economy\u2019 refers to a broad range of economic activities, from health and care products and services, to mobility and ambient assisted living, thus touching upon not only social market segments but also wellness, fitness, leisure, travel, culture, communication, entertainment and, consequently, ICT. The assumptions behind the silver economy concept include: (i) retirees of the baby boomer generation will be wealthier than their predecessors; (ii) the higher education level of future retirees, together with the fact that they are used to higher standard of services than their predecessors, is likely to increase demand for quality services; (iii) more active retirees will impact on consumption and use. However, it is also noted that if purchasing power might facilitate the process of re-establishing respect for age, on the one hand, there is indeed a potential danger, through concentrating only on the economic factor age, of worsening social inequalities \u2018 if the focus is primarily on the privileged elderly with a high spending power \u2019 (Heinze R.G., Naeg G., 2009). Therefore, strategies for developing the silver market should take these socio-economic and cultural differences into account, as well as social divides within the generation of seniors.

        "13 1.2 Basic figures on demographic ageing at regional level 3 Population ageing is forecast for 274 out of the 281 regions of the EU27. By 2030, in fact, only one region in Austria (Wien) and two regions each in Germany (Hamburg and Trier), Greece (Sterea Ellada and Peloponnisos) and the United Kingdom (West Midlands and North Eastern Scotland), will not see their median age increase. In the EU27, the average median age of the population is forecast to rise from 40.4 in 2008 to 45.4 in 2030 and to 47.9 in 2060. At regional level, the population median age will vary from 34.2 years to 57 years in 2030, with a wider range than seen in the 2008 figures (from 32.9 years to 47.8 years); additionally, in 2030, \u2018 almost one in four regions may have a median age of the population higher than 48 years \u2019. Chart 4 compares the forecasted regional highest and lowest median age; the ten highest values are forecast for seven German regions, two Italian regions and one Spanish region; several capitals (Brussels, London, Ile de France, and Greater Manchester) are among the regions for which the ten lowest values are forecast.

        "14 The share of the EU27 overall population aged 65 years or over is projected to increase from 17.1% in 2008 to 23.5% in 2030; at regional level, this share will vary from 10.4% to 37.3%, higher than the 2008 figures (from 9.1% to 26.8%). Additionally, as can be seen in Map 1, 4 at EU27 level the number of elderly people to be supported by those of working age (measured using the old age dependency ratio) is expected to increase from 25.4 % in 2008 to 38 % in 2030, ranging from 14.8% to 70.2% at regional level (compared to the 2008 figures of 12.7% to 43.3%). Across Europe, the ratio is lower in eastern regions, in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and southern parts of Spain. The highest values are in continental regions, in Scandinavia, in the northern regions of Spain and Portugal, and in several regions of Italy, from north to south. Chart 5 shows the latest available Eurostat data on, and EUROPOP2008 projections for, the distribution of NUTS2 across four different classes of \u201865 years or over\u2019; in 2009, the class represented in the highest number of NUTS2 regions was \u201815% - 19%\u2019, followed by the \u201820% - 24%\u2019 class and the \u201814% or less\u2019 class. In 2030, as a consequence of population ageing, there will be very few NUTS2 with the \u201814% or less\u2019 class; the \u201815%-19%\u2019 class is also scarcely represented, most of the NUTS2 having more than 20% of the population aged 65 years or over. 4 Eurostat Glossary: The old-age dependency ratio is the ratio of the number of elderly people at an age when they are generally economically inactive (i.e. aged 65 and over), compared to the number of people of working age (i.e. 15-64 years old).

        "15 2. Employment of older workers Challenges faced by LRAs in terms of the impact of population ageing on the employment of older workers need to be considered in the broader framework of ongoing economic restructuring. This restructuring process is nowadays continuous as a consequence of some major driving forces, all affecting the participation and productivity of older workers in the labour market, including: (cid:131) Innovation and technological change, mainly due to the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). (cid:131) Globalisation and trade liberalisation, often associated with the transfer of production and employment to low- cost economies (\u2018relocation\u2019 to other areas, or \u2018delocalisation\u2019 to other countries) and the emergence of new major (supra-national) regions in the economy, impacting on both people\u2019s decisions to move, i.e. workforce mobility, and the occurrence of structural unemployment. Map 2 shows that the regions most vulnerable to the effects of globalisation are those located in the southern and eastern parts of Europe, their vulnerability mainly being due to reliance on low-value-added economic activities, an unskilled workforce and difficulties in attracting investment or in keeping firms in their region. (cid:131) Structural economic changes occurring as a result of the severe financial and economic crisis and the associated recession hitting the developed world. The magnitude of the economic and financial crisis, in terms of job losses, became evident in the 2009 Eurostat statistics, according to which unemployment rates in 2009 rose dramatically compared to 2008 rates; this is a general trend for all EU MS 5 and for the EU27 as a whole. (cid:131) Prevailing societal changes such as population ageing (B.3). 5 The only exception, at national level, is the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, whose unemployment rate was stable at 5.1% both in 2008 and 2009.

        "16 2.1 EU27 situation and projections Taking the employment rate of people aged 55-64 vs. that of the total population provides information on the potential number of \u2018older workers\u2019, since this age- class is considered the oldest segment of people of working age, the latter conventionally set at 15 to 64 years. Within the EU27 at national level, this rate ranges from 10% in Ireland and Lithuania to 14% in Malta and Finland; regional variation is wider, ranging from 7% in Inner London to 16% in It\u00e4-Suomi. Chart 6 shows the employment rate of the three main age groups in 2009, as a percentage of the national employment level. In all MS, the highest levels of employment can be found in those aged between 25 and 54 years. Overall, employment of older workers (55 - 64 years) is higher than that of the young (15 Chart 6 \u2013 Employment rates by age group, 2009, percentage Source: adapted from Eurostat Employment statistics. B.3 The impact of population ageing on local and regional labour markets Population ageing affects local and regional labour markets in quantitative and qualitative terms as it determines the supply and demand side of local/regional employment and the composition of the workforce. In an empirical analysis of the influence of an ageing work force on unemployment rates at the regional level in Germany, Ochsen (2009) demonstrates that regional unemployment rates increase when the ratio of young to old workers increases. Reasons for this may lie either in the supply side, as young people tend to move to areas with comparatively low unemployment rates, or in the demand-side, as firms may prefer to employ younger workers; it is also clear that job destruction is higher in regions where there is a prevalence of older workers.

        "17 - 24 years), with exceptions recorded in Austria, Denmark, Malta and the Netherlands. Slovenia shows an employment rate which is similar for young and older workers. Projections on employment rates in the EU27 indicate a rising trend. In particular, \u2018\u2026the overall employment rates (of people age 15 to 64) in the EU are projected to increase from 65.5% in 2007 to 69% in 2020, and to almost reach 70% in 2060. \u2019\u2026. \u2018 The employment rate for older workers will increase\u2026\u2026 from 44.9% in 2007 to 54.5% in 2020 and further to 59.8% in 2060. \u2019 6 Chart 7 shows projections for the employment rate of the 55-64 years age group. Some major trends may be identified: (i) on average, the employment rate of older workers is projected to increase in all MS with the exception of Romania, Latvia and Lithuania; (ii) a substantial increase is expected in Poland, Malta, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Spain, Denmark and the United Kingdom; (iii) in 2020, 15 countries will meet the European Employment Strategy target of at least 50% employment of older workers; and (iv) in 2060, 9 MS will still have an older-worker employment rate of below 50%. 6 European Commission (DG ECFIN) and the Economic Policy Committee (AWG) (2008).

",
        "18 2.2 Regional data and labour market-related challenges for LRAs The employment rate for older workers is generally higher in northern regions than in southern ones, although there are several exceptions in Portugal, Spain, and Greece (Map 3). However, the labour market participation of the 55-64 years age group varies greatly between regions. Unemployment rates rose between 2008 and 2009 in 90% of the 271 NUTS2 regions of the EU27, but the number of older workers (55-64 years) decreased in only 87 NUTS2 over the same period, in particular in Bulgaria (4), the Czech Republic (6), Denmark (3), Ireland, Greece (4), Spain (11), France (7), Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Austria (4), Finland (3), Sweden (5) and the UK (22). Among the major implications expected from the current restructuring process of regional economies is an increasing importance of services and, more specifically, of knowledge-based and knowledge-intensive services associated with a shift from low-skilled to higher-skilled employment (Haahr et al ., 2006). In this context, lifelong learning, enabling workers to adapt and maintain their employability, becomes crucial. Interestingly, data on lifelong learning shows limited regional variation (Map 4). ",
        "19 Participation in lifelong learning is high in Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, without regional variation, although \u2018 Within countries, the highest rates of participation in education and training are often found around the largest cities\u2026. \u2019 (Eurostat, 2010). There is a marked gender dimension in the employment rate of older workers. Employment of older male workers is higher than that of their female counterparts. On average, at EU27 level, 58% of employed older workers are male and 42% are female, but at NUTS2 level, such differences vary greatly. The most significant variations of employment rates between men and women are found in Malta, Warminsko-Mazurskie and Opolskie in Poland, and Kentriki Makedonia in Greece, where the share of older male workers ranges from 80% to 71%. On the other hand, Estonia, Latvia and Picardie and Poitou-Charentes in France have the largest share of older female workers (58%, 57%, 56% and 55% respectively). 7 Clusters in the map have been created according to the average 2009 employment rate of older people in EU27 (46%), according to European Commission, DG for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (2010).

        "20 According to the above data analyses, the main challenges associated with the employment of older workers include: (i) mitigation of the impact on the most vulnerable categories of workers of significant factors such as economic recession and the rapid transition to a knowledge-based or knowledge-intensive society leading to an rising demand for skilled work force; (ii) the need to retain older workers in the labour market due to the decrease in the active population and also as a consequence of changes in population dynamics; (iii) consideration of flexible mechanisms to adapt working conditions to an older workforce; and (iv) prevention of the poverty risk for vulnerable groups of workers.

        "21 3. Access to social services (health and long-term care) Access to social services is examined with respect to a number of determining factors, including: health care expenditure, the number of professionals available and progress in the uptake of eHealth. However, the complexity of the institutional framework for health and social systems across the EU MS and the fact that within these systems LRAs may have different levels of accountability on health and social matters, depending on the extent to which powers and responsibilities are decentralised, mean that these factors can only be taken as proxy to a broad understanding of the level of access to services. 3.1 EU27 situation and projections According to OECD data, in 2008, the highest total (public and private) per capita spending on health was in Luxembourg and Austria, followed by Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Denmark, all spending more than 3 000 EUR per person. Countries spending below the EU average of 2 192 EUR per capita include the new MS and Portugal (Chart 8). Public expenditure is higher than private expenditure in all countries but Cyprus; however, in Bulgaria, Greece and Latvia, private expenditure is about 40% of total expenditure. As a percentage of GDP, the largest share is spent by France (11.2%), followed by Austria, Germany and Belgium, all allocating more than 10% of their GDP to health (Chart 9). All new MS, together with Luxembourg (7.2%), have lower allocations than the European average of 8.3%. ",

        "23 It is observed that \u2018 health spending per capita grew more quickly than GDP per capita between 1998 and 2008, resulting in an increasing share of the economy devoted to health in most countries \u2019 (OECD, 2010). Moreover, as a consequence of the economic crisis and recession, the ratio of health expenditure to GDP rose sharply in 2008, compared to 2007, further to contracted economic growth alongside constant or increasing expenditure on health. OECD projections expect public expenditure on health and long-term care as a share of GDP to increase in the long run, and even to double, on average and across OECD countries, over the 2005 \u2013 2050 period. Along the same lines, EC data also forecast an increase in health expenditure. In the light of current demographic and social changes, the European Commission DG for Economic and Financial Affairs recently published the results of a major exercise predicting public health care expenditure, aimed at identifying suitable policy responses based on the view that healthcare expenditure significantly impacts on public finances. Projections, however, are not only based on demographic assumptions but also on a series of other forces driving spending, which are related to both the supply and the demand side of health care provision. Among these driving forces are: people's health status, social determinants of health (environment and living conditions), health behaviour and rising incomes, on the demand side; and technological development, medical research, resource (human and financial) input, market competition and insurance schemes, on the supply side. Different scenarios were developed as sensitivity tests on the impact of individual factors, together with a \u2018reference scenario\u2019 based on a set of limited and relatively well-known factors mostly related to the demand side (demographic changes, health status, and income elasticity). According to this reference scenario, in 2060 there will be an \u2018 average growth in public health care spending of 1.7% of GDP in the EU27 Member States, which equals approximately 25% of the initial (2007) level. The relative percentage increase varies considerably across countries, from 11% in Sweden and 15% in France to as much as 45% in Slovakia and 71% in Malta. The relative increase is on average slightly higher in the EU12 (30%) than in the EU15 countries (23%) \u2019. 8 With regard to the allocation of health spending across the different types of health services and goods, there are large differences between countries. Factors underlying such differences include institutional arrangements for the delivery of services, availability of resources (infrastructure, personnel) and the degree of access to new technology. 8 European Commission, DG Economic and Financial Affairs (2010a) where the assumptions made for the \u2018reference scenario\u2019 are also explained. ",
        "24 As shown in Chart 10, Denmark and Belgium have the highest shares of expenditure allocated to long-term care (21% and 19%, respectively), implying that formal arrangements are in place for the care of the elderly; where such arrangements are of a more informal nature, long-term care expenditure accounts for smaller shares, as is the case for Portugal (1%). Public spending on long-term care is also projected to increase by 1.1% of GDP by 2060, due, among other things, to the increasing size of the older segments of the population, changes in family structure, the increasing proportion of female workers and increasing mobility, i.e. factors potentially impacting on the availability of informal care (European Commission, 2009). Besides the financial input, quantifying human input may contribute to an understanding of the way healthcare is provided to the public. In particular, the number of healthcare staff provides an indication of the resources available for healthcare provision. Data on healthcare personnel show significant variation across MS. For example, the number of \u2018nurses and midwives\u2019 ranges from 344 per 100,000 inhabitants in Greece to 1,486 per 100,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands; and the number of physicians/doctors ranges from 216 per 100,000 inhabitants in Poland to 555 per 100,000 inhabitants in Greece (Eurostat data Chart 10\u2013 Health expenditure by function, 2008 Source: adapted from OECD data (2010). ",
        "25 online). Technological developments and, more precisely, ICT applications for health (or \u2018eHealth\u2019) may substantially change the way health services are delivered, contributing to: (i) increased efficiency in the delivery process; (ii) a reduction in hospital stays; (iii) increased potential for remote long-term care; (iv) increased access to services and therefore reduced health inequalities; and (v) improved quality through a reduction in the number of mistakes, the rationalisation of procedures and processes and steps to ease the administrative burden on health professionals. Countries that spend a larger share of their GDP on healthcare generally have a longer history of national authorities prioritising the implementation of eHealth solutions. 9 The main exception is Romania which, although it has the lowest level of healthcare expenditure in the EU, published its first national IT health strategy as long ago as 1991. Other countries which made eHealth solutions an objective of their healthcare system early on (in the nineties) include Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Of the 27 EU MS, 11 implemented an eHealth strategy in 2005 or 2006. Cyprus only adopted a national eHealth plan for the first time in 2008. 10 3.2 Regional data and social services-related challenges for LRAs The number of healthcare staff per region varies greatly across the EU. Tables 2 and 3 show the ten regions with the highest and the lowest number of physicians/doctors and \u2018nurses and midwives\u2019 per 100,000 inhabitants. Several capital regions have a high number of doctors, with Belgium featuring three NUTS2 regions among the highest ten. The lowest number of doctors is found in Polish and Romanian regions. Nurses and midwives are most numerous in several regions of the UK, while the lowest numbers are in nine regions of Greece and in Brussels. 9 European Commission, DG Information Society and Media (2007), eHealth ERA country reports website. 10 Committee of the Regions (2011).

        "26 According to an inventory compiled for the Committee of the Regions on eHealth initiatives undertaken by LRAs 11 , countries with centralised healthcare systems invest more in \u2018Support initiatives\u2019 on a local and regional level than countries with a more decentralised healthcare system, \u2018support initiatives\u2019 being fostered in 43% of the cases (as compared to 34% in decentralised and 30% in partially decentralised systems).

        "27 Main challenges relating to health care and long-term care are not only determined by demographic changes and the financial implications thereof for public expenditure, but also by the often poor financial situation of elderly people (see chapters 4.1 and 5.1 for information on the at-risk-of-poverty rate for older people and some general considerations on pension systems). These challenges include: (i) increasing public health expenditure for health and long- term care as a consequence of the increased number of people requiring such care, increased life expectancy and increasing demand for long-term care, as well as the decreasing number of \u2018active\u2019 individuals; (ii) increasing demand for (quality) services; and (iii) a lack of staff for the provision of services (B.4). B.4 Need for more demand-driven workforce in social care The increasing need for social care services is reflected in the increase in people employed in health and social care: \u2018 In the EU-27, over 21 million people are employed in health and social services. This represents an increase of 24% since 2000 and 10% of the total workforce in 2009. And despite the crisis, employment in the sector continued to grow in 2009 \u2019. Employment levels in health and social care range from over 18% in Denmark to 4% in Cyprus and Romania, and are, in general, higher in northern and western parts of Europe. Most of the care workers (78.5%) are women, and many are migrants. The research by Cedefop concludes that the sector needs to be more demand-driven by market-based mechanisms and that, rather than specialised staff, generic competences are needed.

        "29 4. Mobility and accessibility of transport Population ageing is expected to change mobility patterns. The coming years will see the ageing of generations used to travel-intensive lifestyles; it may therefore be expected that, depending on their individual financial means and health status, these generations will try to maintain high mobility levels also in their later life. This has several implications for the transport system, such as: a higher demand from the elderly for collective forms of transport, commercial individual transport (such as taxis) and technology-assisted car driving; the increased relevance of safety issues; a rising need for accessible public transport and infrastructure (such as longer times at traffic lights for road crossing, and limited walking distance to and from stops); an increasing need for the provision of medical and special support services at airports and railway stations. 4.1 EU27 situation and projections and common challenges for LRAs Changes in the EU population age structure will impact on mobility. Most of the data on transport are available at European or national level and do not distinguish between passenger age groups or vehicle owner age groups. Only data on road fatalities are available by age group at national level. However, overall, the data confirm people's increasing mobility, with the use of air transport constantly on the increase; more specifically, growth in air travel in the decade \u2018 to 2008 has been greater than in any other mode (37%) and in 2008 could add as much as 10% to the overall demand for passenger transport \u2019 (EEA, 2011a). Private cars and motorcycles are the most sought-after mode of transport, followed by air, public road and rail transport, as well as, with a very small share of the demand for transport, inland navigation (Chart 11). ",
        "30 Demand for air and rail transport is projected to increase by 2030, while demand for private and public transport is projected to decrease slightly by 2030 over 2010. In general, the share of public transport has increased across Europe in the last decade, but with trends that are significantly different in the EU15 and the EU12. In fact, over the last ten years demand for bus transport has grown by 10% in the EU15 and fallen by 4% in the EU12, most probably due to an increase in private car ownership and use; similarly, demand for rail passenger transport grew by nearly 30% in the EU15 in the ten years to 2008, and fell by around 20% in the EU12 during the same period (EEA, 2011a). Older people are expected to \u2018 compose a larger share of the driving population than in the past \u2019 (Tetraplan A/S et al ., 2009), with women substantially increasing car and driving license ownership. Over the 2005-2009 period, car ownership increased in all EU countries except for Cyprus. Increases are in the range of 1-5% for EU15 countries and higher for EU12 countries, with peaks of +22% in Romania and +24% in Bulgaria. 13 According to the IEA/SMP Transportation Model (EEA, 2010), car ownership is projected to increase by 46% over the 2000-2050 period in OECD Europe. Mobility has a cost. Chart 12 shows the level of expenditure on personal mobility as a share of household expenditure, with data ordered by increasing expenditure on transport services. The cost of transport services is a factor that needs to be taken into account by public authorities, as an increasing proportion of older people live alone as a result of changes in family structures, relying on individual incomes or pensions; additionally, elderly people \u2018 face a higher risk of poverty than the total population. In 2008, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for those aged 65 years and over was 19% in the EU27. The highest rates were 13 EEA dataset, indicator TERM32, specified source: TREMOVE v3.3.1.

Population ageing will also have implications for safety, as age-related constraints cause functional limitations while driving. Data (Charts 13 and 14) show that older drivers (65 years or over) have a relatively high fatality rate, probably due to their physical vulnerability. Older drivers\u2019 fatality rates are above 1 in 4 in Malta, the Netherlands and Austria; while in Malta fatalities occur only in the urban setting, in the Netherlands and in Austria fatalities are more frequent in rural areas, as is the case in Spain and France.

        "35 5. Adapted housing for the ageing population The most comprehensive information on adapted housing is sourced from a report produced in 2007 by the UEPC - European Federation of Housing and Building Companies - and the German Federation of Independent Property and Housing Companies. Apart from scattered information that may be gathered from national reports, no other comprehensive overviews are available; statistics are produced for the EU27 on housing stock, but do not distinguish between adapted, non-adapted and potentially adaptable houses. Additionally, adaptation is often intended for impaired or disabled people, but \u2018senior housing\u2019 nonetheless has different scopes and features and needs to be considered as a separate category. 5.1 EU27 situation, national data and common challenges for LRAs According to the UEPC report, \u2018 The segment of barrier-free housing or housing adapted to the needs of senior citizens accounts for an average market share of approximately one percent of the entire housing stock in European countries and the trend is growing. In Germany the proportion of homes suitable for the elderly is approximately one percent, whereas Belgium and the Netherlands dominate with shares of two and five percent. \u2019 Further, in the Netherlands, 50% of new houses are designed and constructed as \u2018adaptable\u2019 according to existing regulations. The study, based on a survey of 12 EU countries plus Turkey, reports that barrier-free or low-barrier accommodation adapted to the needs of the elderly exists in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, while it is still lacking in Romania and Latvia. There are two main models of adapted housing: in-patient nursing units or \u2018care models\u2019, and housing communities, and \u2018housing models\u2019, the latter being established within normal residential environments slightly adapted to the needs of the elderly and associated with the provision of a certain level of services. Adaptation is reported to be \u2018 subsidized by national governments directly or under tax law \u2019 and, usually, when support from public authorities is provided, there are regulations which have to be complied with during construction/adaptation. Adapted housing or housing for the elderly is considered a potentially important market that is developing as a consequence of population ageing. According to the UEPC study, in order to cope with raising demand, initiatives by developers will have to come in addition to public efforts. ",
        "36 Among the factors that may drive the development of adapted houses, besides policies and public incentives there is housing ownership and the income level of older people. In general, statistics show that the older the people, the lower the share of housing ownership, with differences across the age groups being greater in northern countries than in southern Europe (Chart 15). As mentioned in section 4.1, almost 1 in 5 individuals aged 65 or over is at risk of poverty. Over the 2007-2009 period, the average at-risk-of poverty rate for people aged 65 years or over decreased by 2.4% at EU27 level; however, this average decrease corresponds to a decrease in the EU15 countries (from 20.2% in 2007 to 17.8% in 2009) and an increase in EU12 countries (from 16% in 2007 to 17.9% in 2009). Elderly people living alone are amongst the most vulnerable categories in economic terms, and within that group, women \u2018 are particularly at risk of poverty, due to the fact that retirement pensions for women are significantly less generous than for men. Moreover, women have shorter careers and earn less during their working lives\u2026 \u2019 (European Social Housing Observatory, 2008). The number of older people living alone is projected to increase significantly over the next decades; more specifically, the number of people aged 60 years or more living alone is expected to increase from 32.3 million in 2001 to around 51.6 million in 2050; most of these elderly people living independently will be located in EU15 MS (Table 4). A sharper increase is expected in the number of people aged 80 years or more living alone, from 6.1 million in 2001 to 22.5 million in 2050.

The wealth of current and future pensioners depends greatly on the impact of current pension system reforms across the EU. The overall reform process is complex due to the fact that it is country-specific, although rooted in a common EU framework for policy learning (the Social Open Method for Coordination) and for fiscal policy (the Stability and Growth Pact). In addition, the financial crisis and economic downturn further stressed the need to strike the right balance between public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems and supplementary collective or private schemes, i.e. across the three main conventional pillars of pensions. 14 A few major challenges being addressed by pension reforms, as highlighted in the 2010 Joint Report on Pensions, are summarised in B.5. Reforms are carried out at national level, although local and regional authorities may contribute to efforts to mitigate the risk of vulnerable categories of people falling into poverty by incentivising supplementary pension funds. 14 Developed by the World Bank, the following pillar structure acts as a point of reference in the European debate: first pillar \u2013 public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pensions; second pillar \u2013 private occupational pension schemes; third pillar \u2013 private individual pensions. ",
        "38 In Chart 16, a comparison between national levels of poverty risk for older people with pension expenditure outlines the effectiveness of pension expenditure in combating poverty. Only a few countries achieve relatively low at-risk-of-poverty rates associated with low pension expenditure, but it should be noted that poverty levels take only monetary income into account, thus excluding house ownership, private savings and other non-monetary benefits such as subsidised or free health care; it should also be noted that, for example, low levels of expenditure may be a consequence of a significant increase in GDP, especially in EU10 countries, since expenditure is expressed as a share of GDP. Chart 16 - At-risk-of-poverty rate of people aged 65+ and pension expenditure in EU Member States, 2007 Source: European Commission, DG Economic and Financial Affairs, 2010b B.5 Some major challenges of European pension systems Among the challenges addressed by pension reforms across EU countries are: (i) the extension of coverage to vulnerable categories such as farmers, the self-employed and women with low entitlements; (ii) steps to better gear the schemes to gender roles, for example by crediting caring years; or to changing labour markets, with more atypical careers and short-term contracts; (iii) the increase in minimum pensions and supplementary allowances; (iv) adjustments for periods of unemployment, lower contributions and poorer returns on the financial market \u2013 especially as a consequence of the ongoing financial crisis \u2013 mostly impacting on the currently active population and its pension rights.

        "39 Finally, besides economic considerations, the attitude of the elderly to changes and mobility (i.e. moving into new housing specifically designed from the outset to meet with ageing needs) should also be considered when planning the adaptation of housing: \u2018 some believe that elderly people should be allowed to keep living in their homes in order to avoid losing their connection to their own physical, social and psychological environment. For example, the UK strategy on \u2018lifetimes homes\u2019 aims to provide adaptable \u2018homes for life \u2019, (European Social Housing Observatory, 2008). Demographic changes and financial considerations are the main drivers of upcoming challenges for LRAs, namely: (i) an ageing population wishing to live as long as possible in their own home; (ii) the opening up of new employment and economic opportunities for both care providers and building companies; and (iii) potentially increasing inequalities in terms of quality of life between those elderly people who can afford to adapt their homes and those who cannot, due to an overall fragile nature of the target category in physical (possibly social and psychological) and often financial terms.

Participation in community activities Information on the participation of older people in the activities of their local communities is available through the EU SILC \u2013 Statistics on Income and Living Conditions \u2013 survey. In 2006, a special module on social participation was included in the survey, gathering additional information. 6.1 EU24 situation, national data and common challenges for LRAs Social isolation is found to increase with age; elderly people experience a decrease in the number of their friends over time, in parallel with a growing difficulty in establishing new relationships. In particular, \u2018 in two thirds of the countries, over 1 in 10 persons aged 65 or more have no friends or never meet them. This share increases to more than 1 in 4 in case of Hungary and Latvia, indicating that a large proportion of elderly people are isolated. \u2019, (Eurostat, 2010c). Chart 17 shows the ratio of those aged between 18 and 64 years and those aged 65 or over with no friends vs. the total population; this ratio is much higher for the older age group, with the highest values found in Slovakia, Cyprus, Lithuania and Denmark.

Social exclusion is determined by various factors ranging from economic considerations to the structural organisation of the society, as well as technological development. The first challenge facing LRAs is that elderly people are highly vulnerable to isolation and that vulnerability is greater as a consequence of common trends across Europe such as decreasing opportunities for family care, changing family structures and a widening generation divide driven by the internet and new technologies. A poor financial situation may add to the above factors, making an exacerbation of the social divide within the generation of senior citizens a real risk. ",

More specifically, it can be a constraint on: (i) regional and local economic growth, as well as access to life-long learning; (ii) access to eServices; (iii) technological innovation in mobility; and (iv) automation in the home, in housework and in rough household activity. Additionally, (v) the digital divide can make social exclusion more acute. Differences between regions in terms of IT availability and penetration are huge.

While the role of ICT is obvious in terms of eServices such as telemedicine and telecare, or house automation such as domotics, the impact of ICT on regional growth, productivity, and employment was recently researched by Barrios et al. (2008). These authors found that the ICT industry is concentrated geographically both in rich regions where it was originally clustered, and in less wealthy areas, including those located in new MS such as Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, where, it has been noted, concentration has developed over the last decade. Although based on the evidence of limited empirical data, the ICT industry seems to be contributing to regional convergence and growth; additionally, the ICT sector has been found to have a higher share of educated people compared to other economic sectors, and to be attracted by the presence of local ICT SMEs and workers\u2019 skills.

Prevalence of urban vs. rural population (EU methodology, derived from the OECD methodology).

The typology is taken from Navarro et al. (2008) and is developed on the basis of 21 indicators, covers 25 EU MS and places great emphasis on employment, with six indicators relating to employment rates (total employment and employment in the main economic sectors \u2013 agriculture, livestock and fishing; industry; business and financial services; medium and high-tech services; and high-tech services); additionally, it considers an accessibility index and places emphasis on R&D (with five indicators) as well as education.

These regions are usually hallmarked by high specialisation in manufacturing (with the exception of Estonia), with \u2018 low levels in tertiary education, life- long learning, accessibility, human resources in science and technology and expenditures on R&D \u2019. (cid:131) G2: Regions with weak economic and technological performance, mostly relying on the service sector (tourism) or agriculture. These regions have low income per capita, low accessibility, low population density and low \u2018 R&D intensity, tertiary education, employment rate, life-long learning and human resources in science and technology \u2019. (cid:131) G3: Regions with average economic and technological performance. This group encompasses a high number of regions, all from EU15 countries, with the exception of Slovenia, characterised by a wide range of productive structure (from industry to service or agriculture). (cid:131) G4: Advanced regions, with a certain amount of industrial specialisation. Historically based on the industrial sector, some of the regions belonging to this group have managed to \u2018 base their industry in medium-high and high-tech manufactures, with a strong development of R&D activities \u2019, ",
        "52 while others have converted their industry to new sectors. \u2018 On average, these regions have a high level of accessibility, high population density and high R&D expenditures \u2019. (cid:131) G5: Innovative regions, with a high level of economic and technological development. This is the smallest group and contains ten regions, all from the north of Europe. These regions have high level of education and life- long learning, high expenditure in R&D and high patent creation. (cid:131) G6: Capital-regions, with a certain amount of specialisation in high value- added services. This group encompasses national capitals from EU15 and EU10 countries (the so-called \u2018re-invented capitals\u2019 \u2018 considered as champions of the economic transition and engines of the economic activity \u2019 of the new MS) with good economic development and a technological development level above the European average, mostly due to a high level of R&D. Regions \u2018 with a high concentration of private and public research activities and a high level of economic development \u2019 also belong to this group: they have high density population and high income and education levels, with a certain amount of specialisation in high-tech services, financial and business services. (cid:131) G7: Innovative capital-regions. These regions are specialised in high value-added services. In this group are capitals and regions that have become \u2018knowledge-hubs\u2019. They \u2018 have high levels of income, tertiary education, life-long learning, accessibility, population density and patents \u2019, and high levels of R&D expenditure. \u2018 Their sectoral specialisation is in high-tech services and financial and business services, all of them acting as a support to innovation activities \u2019. It should be noted that, by comparing the typology of Navarro et al. with the classification of regions according to the Convergence and Competitiveness and Employment Objectives, there is a relatively good correlation between G1 and G2 on one hand, and the Convergence regions on the other; and between G3 to G7 on one hand, and the Competitiveness and Employment regions on the other. Criteria 2: old age dependency ratio The old age dependency ratio is the ratio of the number of elderly people (65 years or over) to the number of people in the working-age population (i.e. 15-64 years old). It is an indicator of the extent to which the working-age population must support the older population. Higher values of the ratio may combine an increased proportion of older people with a decreasing proportion of working- age people. It is expressed as a percentage. 15 15 For example, the EU27 average old age dependency ratio of 25.9% (Giannakouris K., 2010) means that 100 people of working age support almost 26 people aged 65 or over. ",
        "53 Criteria 3: population crude growth rate The crude growth rate is the crude birth rate minus the crude death rate (or natural change) plus the total net migration rate, i.e. the difference between inward and outward migration flows. The crude rate of population growth is \u2018 the ratio of the total population growth during the year to the average population of the area in question in that year \u2019. 16 It is expressed per 1,000 inhabitants (\u2030). The growth rate is an indicator for monitoring population size. Criteria 4: prevalence of urban or rural population To distinguish between regions on the basis of the prevalence of urban or rural populations, the typology developed by DG Agriculture and Rural Development, Eurostat, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and DG Regional Policy has been used. This typology is based on a variation of the OECD methodology and provides a classification at NUTS3 level (Map 6). Three main classes are defined within this typology: (i) predominantly urban regions, with a rural population of less than 20% of total population (red areas in the map); (ii) intermediate regions, with a rural population of between 20 and 50% of total population (yellow areas); and (iii) predominantly rural regions, with a rural population of 50% or more of total population (green areas). 16 Eurostat, 2009.

        "54 8.2 Outlining the types For the purposes of this report, the seven groups of Navarro et al. were initially aggregated into three groups as follows: (i) regions belonging to G1 and G2 characterised by weak economic development (WEAK); (ii) regions belonging to G3 characterised by average development (AVERAGE) and (iii) regions belonging to G4, G5, G6 and G7 characterised by strong development (STRONG). 17 With respect to the old age dependency ratio, regions were divided into two groups: (i) regions with a ratio below the EU27 average of 25.9% (YOUNG); and (ii) regions with a ratio above the EU27 average of 25.9% (OLD). With respect to the population crude growth rate, regions were divided into two groups: (i) regions with a negative rate or zero growth (DECLINE); and (ii) regions with a positive rate (INCREASE). The developers of the urban-rural typology have argued that aggregation at NUTS2 level would change the typology substantially so, rather than the aggregation of data, the prevailing type of NUTS3 units was considered to classify a region type as \u2018predominantly urban\u2019 (U), \u2018predominantly rural\u2019 (R) or \u2018intermediate\u2019 (IN). In practice, for each region, NUTS3 units labelled PU (predominantly urban), IN (intermediate) or PR (predominantly rural) were counted and the most relevant label attributed to the region. 8.3 Proposed typology of regions Table 7 summarises the proposed typology according to the criteria and approach presented in sections 8.1 and 8.2. Seven types of regions are distinguished within the proposed typology. 17 Bulgarian and Romanian regions, originally not encompassed in the Navarro typology, have been attributed to G2. ",

These regions are characterised as predominantly urban or intermediate (with a few exceptions of rural regions). All G7 regions (Navarro\u2019s classification) and most of the G6 regions belong to these two types. The two types differ in the value of the old age dependency ratio - below the EU27 average level in type 1 and above the EU27 average in type 2. 18 The following eight NUTS2 have not been included in the categorization: Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Ceuta (ES), Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Melilla (ES), Guadeloupe (FR), Martinique (FR), Guyane (FR), R\u00e9union (FR), Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma dos A\u00e7ores (PT) and Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma da Madeira (PT).

        "57 Types 3 and 4 include regions hallmarked by a growing population and weak or moderate economic growth and innovation levels. These regions are predominantly rural or intermediate (with a few exceptions of urban regions); rural regions are, in particular, found where the old age dependency ratio is high. Regions of types 3 and 4 belong to G1, G2 and G3 (Navarro\u2019s classification). The two types differ in the value of the old age dependency ratio - below the EU27 average level in type 3 and above the EU27 average in type 4. Types 5, 6 and 7 are all characterised by shrinking populations. Across these three types, economic growth varies from weak to strong; two types (5 and 6) have an old age dependency ratio above the EU27 average. Type 5 includes only intermediate regions; types 6 and 7 are predominantly rural. Regions by type are specified in Table 4 and set out in image form in Map 7. ",

In 2010, a plan of action to combat inequalities in the regional labour market was agreed among relevant public and social stakeholders in the \u00cele-de-France. The plan has four main targets: (i) gender equality; (ii) access to the labour market for people with disabilities and the possibility of remaining in employment; (iii) steps to combat regional and local discrimination; and (iv) efforts to keep older workers employed. The plan follows up a series of regional measures for facilitating the employment of older workers, including the Senior Competence pilot initiative launched in 2006 and co-funded by the ESF, under article 6 for innovative actions. The plan will be subject to regular evaluation. Several initiatives have been undertaken at regional and local level, ranging from the provision of counselling and professional training services (as of 2010) to the organisation of forums for facilitating contacts between older unemployed people and businesses (as of 2009, organised on two occasions so far), and consulting services and awareness-raising for entrepreneurs to encourage them to keep older workers in employment.

The network started in 2004 with financial support from the European Social Fund (ESF). Over the 2006-2009 period, the network secured further funding from Yorkshire Forward under the MORE (Making Opportunities Realistic For Everyone) employability programme. The network mainly supports people aged 45 or over who are seeking employment, by providing employability skills through courses, counselling and training; \u2018 Support is available in the form of workshops including CV-writing, confidence and motivation building, interview skills, conducting job searches and completing job applications. Every client joining OWEN is allocated an OWEN personal adviser. The PAs work closely with clients from the moment they join and for the duration of the programme, providing information, advice and guidance. \u2019 OWEN was nominated for an adult learner award in the 2011 awards run by NIACE (National Institute of Adults Continuing Education).

Extremadura has several areas devoted to sheep and goat breeding. This, however, is not looked upon as a dignified profession and is not economically rewarding. The project, implemented over the 2008-2010 period, aimed at retaining professionals in the sector by providing incentives to individuals and businesses, and in particular to: women, immigrants, those aged 45 years or more and low skilled workers. The objectives of the project were: to improve sectoral employment; enhance workers' skills through training, seminars, individualised support, etc.; and to support the establishment of economically and environmentally sustainable and more modern enterprises.

EMPL - The \u2018 Akademie 50plus \u2019 programme, Brandenburg State (DE) \u2013 Type of region: 5 Challenges: (cid:23) low employment rates of older workers, in particular women. In 2001, older male workers represented 6% of the total work force, against a 3% share of female workers within the total work force; according to Eurostat statistics, these shares rose to 8% and 7% respectively for men and women in 2009 (cid:23) responding to the EU call for active ageing Description. The Akademie 50plus is a programme aimed at helping older unemployed people return to the labour market. Because it is particularly difficult for women to access the labour market, it was decided to introduce a gender quota for participation: 60% for female participants and 40% for male participants. The core concept behind this programme is to use, maintain and develop the skills of older people, and thus harness their potential, by delivering the following services: (i) organisation and implementation of ",
        "64 professional qualification and training services, adapted to the needs of the regional economy and performance requirements; (ii) training and aftercare, if needed, of programme participants after they are employed; (iii) liaison with employers and labour market stakeholders in the regions; (iv) individual advice to participants as well as motivational and psychological support to help them through the integration process; and (v) public relations and media relations to promote a regional/local exchange of views on \u2018older workers and public employment\u2019. The programme started in 2001 and has been extended to April 2011. Between 2001 and 2008, it provided support for more than 8,000 people; in 2008, 217 older people re-entered the labour market. Governance structure . The programme is run by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Health and Family of the State of Brandenburg; through calls for projects, its implementation throughout the districts of the State is being encouraged. Services are delivered through local employment offices. Among the municipalities participating in the programme are Cottbus, Eberswalde, Frankfurt (Oder), Neuruppin and Potsdam. Funding.

In July 2009, the Regional Authority of Puglia joined the Welfare to Work System Action promoted by the national government by presenting a proposal for implementation where regional priorities and target stakeholders were identified. Welfare to Work in Puglia aims to provide individual grants for self-employment and business start-ups to facilitate access to the labour market for individuals in vulnerable groups. All initiatives are to be implemented in the region. The grant (25,000 EUR) targets people who have been unemployed for a period of at least 24 months and unemployed people aged 45 years or over. It was launched at the beginning of 2010 with a deadline for applications in October 2010. Governance structure . The measure is managed by the Puglia Region, including financial administration.

Under its 2007-2013 Development Plan, updated yearly when setting the objectives and financial resources for implementation, in early 2010 the municipality of Dobrich prepared its first Local Action Plan \u2018Age and Economy\u2019 outlining problems faced by 45+ in re-entering the labour market and in re-qualifying. The overall objective of the plan is to \u2018 Create conditions for the better use of the potential of 45+ from the town of Dobrich and to foster their more active participation in the public life and to reduce the poverty in the municipality through improvement of the opportunities for participation in the economic processes and particularly in the labour market\u2019. The plan encompasses specific objectives and activities: (i) improve employment opportunities for people aged 45 or over (45+) by means of needs analysis, supportive training and the provision of personalised services; (ii) make it easier for them to stay in the labour market by enhancing their skills through professional training and training in ICT knowledge and use; (iii) foster entrepreneurship through training in business development; and (iv) public debate and campaigns about problems faced by older people through the establishment of a Municipal Council with representatives of national, regional and local stakeholders, institutions, including trade union organisations. Governance structure . The plan was prepared by the Municipality of Dobrich as Lead Partner, in cooperation with the Local Employment Office of the National Employment Agency, a business centre and a private consulting company. Funding. Budgets are allocated by activity and are in the range of a few thousand EUR, though not all expenses are quantified in the plan.

        "66 CARE - The \u2018CaringTV\u2019 project, Etel\u00e4-Suomi (FI) - Type of region: 1 Challenges: (cid:23) increasing needs of elderly people (cid:23) decreasing number of care-providers (cid:23) changing structure of welfare organisations and service processes requiring new working and cooperation methods, networking of different types of services, and mainstreaming of services Description. CaringTV ( HyvinvointiTV ) is an example of business innovation and telecare where ICT supports the transfer of medical information and permits the delivery of clinical services to patients and/or older people in their homes. On the technological side, CaringTV relies on a two-channel interactive TV system utilising a safe broadband connection for the delivery of services; users can access the system via a customer-tailored interface on their ordinary TV set and have a two-way video link which allows both the sender and the recipient to see and hear each other simultaneously. The system allows high-quality interaction between the elderly, on one hand, and social workers and health care professionals, as well as relatives and/or friends, on the other. The CaringTV system has been developed within the framework of the Finn Well/InnoElli Senior programme, an \u2018innovative action\u2019 administered by the South Finland Regional Alliance and aimed at creating integrated service models enabling public, private and third-sector organisations to adopt new working methods and provide ICT-based services in the field of elderly care in a cost-effective manner. The system was aimed at providing support, guidance and counselling to senior citizens living at home or being discharged from hospital, and to people at high risk of illness. The main categories of virtual services identified were health, mental health, nutrition, rehabilitation, social and care services. After a pilot phase, the application was introduced in several other projects of the InnoElli Senior Programme. Governance structure . The project is a collaborative effort between public and private stakeholders. The Finnish Laurea University of Applied Sciences is responsible for the research and development of the CaringTV concept, as well as the participative content production, while two private companies, TDC Song and Videra Oy Ldt, provide the technology; the municipalities involved (Espoo, Vantaa, Laitila, Lappeenranta and Turku) provide guidance and support services. In particular, Espoo City was among the promoters and developers of this interactive technology. Funding .

The project objective is to improve public transport infrastructure and equipment throughout La Rochelle Urban Community to achieve 100% accessibility of buses and bus stops by 2015, especially for people with reduced mobility. Firstly, there was a diagnosis phase, where consultation was carried out with all the relevant stakeholders. As a result, an Accessibility Committee was created in 2005. In 2006, an Accessibility Scheme in public transport was adopted, where the steps needed for a fully accessible public transport network over the 2005-2015 period were defined. By the end of 2008, over 60% of buses complied with accessibility standards; since the project did not only target infrastructure improvement but also better information, very high levels of acceptance and awareness of the new facilities were also secured across the population. Among the measures implemented were: low-floor buses, visual aid system on buses, adapted information on board, higher platforms at bus stops, real-time information and visual aid system at bus stops, automatic doors, fully accessible information desk and the publication of an Accessibility Guide for the visually impaired.

The Plan for Vertical Transport has been developed in order to reduce the use of private cars, increase the number of cycling and walking trips to and from the city centre and improve the use of public transport. For implementation of the plan the municipality of San Sebastian considered, among other things, the topographic data of the area, connectivity with public transport lines and the transport capacity of alternative modes. Although the initiative is intended for the benefit of all those living in the hilly part of the city, with the overall aim of encouraging a shift towards non-motorised modes of transport, older people and those with limited mobility are specifically targeted. In 2010, five lifts and two escalators were installed, and five more were in the pipeline, some of which aimed to facilitate access to the city centre and others to connect to pedestrian routes or the public transport network. It is expected that the gradual implementation of the plan will be delayed because of the current economic situation. Governance structure .

Through the Wohnungsamt Landeshauptadt initiative, the municipality of D\u00fcsseldorf provides advice and support services to older and disabled people wishing to live as long as possible in their homes. This local authority provides help to elderly and vulnerable people should they need to adapt their homes. If a vulnerable person lives in an apartment that needs to be adapted to specific requirements, the municipality provides advice on the best way to carry out alterations and undertakes to make the necessary adjustments, such as widening doors, putting in place handrails and grab bars, and building a ramp, free of charge. If the housing cannot be adapted and other accommodation needs to be found, the municipality helps identify an alternative place and arrange the transfer. Another mechanism the municipality coordinates is the \u2018residential model\u2019, i.e. a temporary housing partnership between the elderly and students based on mutual help. Under this scheme, older people offer affordable housing to students, while the students pay back the equivalent of the rent by means of daily work such as shopping, cooking or spending some hours walking or talking together with the older person; nursing activities are not, however, included. The housing advice supports these housing partnerships by selecting the two partners and bringing them together, helping finalise the agreement and monitoring its implementation. The municipality of D\u00fcsseldorf also provides low interest credit to those interested in carrying out alterations to their homes. Governance structure .

The project objective is to create houses adapted to the needs of older people by incorporating home automation mechanisms through IP voice, tactile interaction etc. Within the framework of the project, software was developed in 2007 enabling intelligent control of home automation items providing care services. Subsequently, a prototype building was constructed in ",

Additionally, the building allowed energy efficiency measures, a higher level of security through early hazard detection and prevention of accidents through monitoring, anomaly detection and generation of alerts and notifications. In 2009, the Basque Government delivered 156 homes for rent, 7 of which are fully adapted to the needs of disabled people. The rent for these houses is calculated on the basis of the tenants' income and the surface area of the house, the average rent being around 240 EUR per month. Governance structure . Project partners include VISESA, the public housing development company of the Basque Government's Department of Housing and three companies specialised in the field of home automation. Furthermore, the Deusto Technology Foundation Centre provides assistance in the innovation process. Funding. Funding is through the Basque Government's programme entitled \u2018GAITEK 2006 and 2007 - Support for projects to develop new products\u2019, Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism. Construction of the houses, with an investment of almost 11 million EUR, has been promoted by VISESA.

PART - Link Age Plus, Devon County Council (UK) \u2013 Type of region: 2 Challenges: (cid:23) large rural shire county, with distinct local communities based around 28 main market and coastal towns and their rural hinterlands (cid:23) limited engagement of and consultation with older people, mostly based on traditional approaches (cid:23) increasing share of older people, and increasing number of elderly living alone. Description. Devon County Council was one of eight local authorities to pilot a new national Government initiative to tackle social exclusion among people aged 50 plus, particularly those belonging to vulnerable categories such as frailer people and people from minority communities. In Devon, emphasis was given to deep outreach and community mentoring work; a Senior Council for Devon was also established and continued even after the completion of the pilot. In Devon, multiple access points to services were developed, highlighting how outreach activities are fundamental in ensuring the inclusion of those who are most difficult to reach. Among the initiatives which were implemented are: community mentoring, entailing tailored support for individuals aged 50 years or over and aimed at tackling social exclusion; and the development of a senior council with representatives of local communities across the county: \u2018 The Senior Council for Devon gives older people a voice, provides a way of engaging with them, listens to their views and aspirations, and works in partnership to develop practical ideas and actions to address their concerns \u2019 (Senior Council for Devon website). The council has over 1,000 members, representing the rural/urban settlement pattern of Devon and actively involving ethnic minority groups. Governance structure . At national level, there is a Steering Group regularly informed by reports produced in each pilot site. A Programme Board is composed of representatives of the eight pilot authorities. In each pilot there is a local programme board encompassing a wide range of stakeholders and functioning as the Link Age Plus Implementation Team and a Link Age Plus Operational Group coordinated by a Programme Manager. Funding. National and local funding, the former through the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) with some \u00a310 million invested over a two-year period; the latter with contributions from involved local authorities, also covering the take-over of activities once the pilot has ended. For example, the establishment of the Senior Council for Devon was funded by a \u00a3200,000 grant from the DWP and \u00a3125,000 from the County Council. Sources: Devon County Council website. ",

The initiative aims to create areas dedicated to older people, where the elderly can exercise and meet within the parks of the four municipalities of la Comarca los V\u00e9lez. Rehabilitation and exercise opportunities were already offered to the elderly population in dedicated structures, but participation was low due to the difficulty of reconciling time availability and the requirements of all potential participants. Thus, the idea was conceived of providing facilities for senior citizens in parks where they usually go to accompany their granddaughters or grandsons. The initiative was developed in close cooperation with the four municipalities owning the parks, relevant associations of older people and the Group for the Rural Development of Los V\u00e9lez (Aprov\u00e9lez); sites within the parks were identified and equipment to be installed selected so as to allow comprehensive physical exercise; a company for the provision and installation of the equipment was selected through public tender, and finally the new facilities were publicised and awareness raised about what they were for. The dedicated sites within the parks promote both inter-generational and social inclusion. Governance structure . Aprov\u00e9lez is responsible for the initiative that was developed in close cooperation with municipal authorities and local associations. Upon completion of the project in 2006, municipalities became responsible for the maintenance and cleaning of the sites, done once a month. Funding. From Aprov\u00e9lez, FEAOG (European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund), the Andalusian Regional authority and the four municipalities. Total cost to the municipality: around 200,000 EUR for V\u00e9lez- Rubio; some 33,000 EUR for V\u00e9lez Blanco; some 25,000 EUR for Maria; and less than 19,000 EUR for Chirivel.

        "85 10. Main responses by LRAs to common challenges Overall, there is evidence that a demographic dimension to regional and local policy is being developed, as processes of demographic change need to be increasingly taken into account in territorial development, regardless of the type of region under consideration. Demographic changes have a cross-sectoral impact, but they seem to be most often addressed through sector-specific strategies. In addition, some LRAs appear to share similar types of sectoral strategy intervention across all the seven types of region identified; namely, out of the five policy areas considered in this report, no significant differences were noted across regions with regard to initiatives on the social inclusion of elderly people or the facilitation of their access to social services. All regions, including those with a relatively low old age dependency ratio, look for ICT-based solutions for the delivery of health and long-term care services. Examples of community-based initiatives are frequent and rather than being based on the type of region they seem to be related to societal characteristics such as a high share of migrants (as in the case of the German municipality) or changing family structures that entail the need to look for alternative ways of care provision for the elderly (as in the cases of the Italian and Romanian regions). An overview of main responses by LRAs to common challenges is provided below, by policy area. It is followed by a characterisation of each type of region according to the evidence gathered and set out in chapter 9. 10.1 Main responses by policy area Employment Mitigating the impact of the economic crisis on older workers Mitigation measures include measures enabling the employment rate of older workers to be maintained while waiting for overall labour market conditions to improve; and measures aiming, overall, to reduce unemployment among the elderly by supporting their re-entrance into the labour market. The quantitative retention in employment of older workers is targeted through the prevention of firm restructuring caused by down-sizing, bankruptcy, relocation and acquisition, elements that often entail redundancies for the most vulnerable categories of workers. This is implemented through the coordination and guidance of social dialogue between representatives of the social players and ",
        "86 businesses; incentives for self-employment and business start-ups; efforts to combat prejudice towards older workers through measures aimed at changing the attitude of employers, such as awareness-raising campaigns or lead-by- example initiatives by public authorities as employers. Re-entering the labour market also entails the need to maintain the employability of older workers or to adapt it to the emerging needs of regional economies (i.e. targeting qualitative aspects of the supply side) through, for example, (lifelong) learning, professional training and competence development, where the enhancement of ICT skills is very important; or through efforts to match labour supply and demand, for example by organising events and forums where the business community meets elderly people who are unemployed. In general, eAccessibility in the work place is a central factor to be considered while meeting the needs of an ageing work force. Important commonly implemented elements by LRAs are active labour market policies at local and regional level fostering training programmes to maintain and upgrade the skills of the unemployed, or to ensure a role for training and education in the labour market. Addressing falling dependency ratios The fact there are fewer workers supporting more retired people is caused not only by ageing but also by population movement or economic migration. Regional labour markets may face the need to attract labour supply and skills if economic growth is to remain sustainable. Such needs may be partially met locally by increasing the employment rate of older workers and/or by encouraging inward migration processes, even if the latter initiative mostly addresses the young labour force. Worker mobility is also considered a solution across sectors, countries or regions, but there is no evidence of mobility initiatives specifically undertaken for older workers. In Sweden, larger labour market regions were created to respond better to problems in matching supply and demand caused by increasing imbalances in the population age structure (Rauhut and Kahila, 2011), while in the UK the identification of \u2018 functional economic areas, including labour market areas (e.g. through inter-regional frameworks such as the Northern-Way, Multi Area Agreements and city-regions) \u2019 is being considered (Ferry and Vironen, 2010); yet all these measures are initiated at national level, showing the difficulties in implementing \u2018matching\u2019 strategies at local levels. Addressing the social and gender dimension of ageing for people in the labour market People go through different stages of family life (child-raising or caring for parents, for example) and family structures (divorce, for example), usually occurring in a more mature phase of working life. Some of these circumstances may affect a worker\u2019s capacity to stay in the labour market and flexible approaches to work may prove to be necessary to retain the individuals ",
        "87 concerned in the market. It is not only a matter of part-time but also of flexible working hours, functional flexibility (adaptation of tasks to relieve workload, senior-specific jobs, suitable working conditions, tele-working opportunities), and active labour market policies providing, for example, for long-term care services and a supportive urban environment to prevent situations where older women have to leave their jobs to look after elderly parents. There are several examples of flexicurity approaches implemented at company level; national strategies are also common, but institutionalised regional and local measures seem to be less frequent. Preventing the risk of poverty for vulnerable groups of workers The importance of supplementary pension schemes is increasing, and notwithstanding the fact that pension reform processes are conducted at national level, local and regional authorities have a role to play in undertaking initiatives that may prevent the currently active generations from falling into poverty in the future. This may be achieved by providing incentives for undertaking supplementary pension funds/retirement schemes managed by third parties (individuals or employers) or by the same regional authorities, or by leading by example through the promotion of late retirement of civil servants. Access to social services (health and long-term care) Facing increasing public health expenditure for health and long-term care The main type of measures implemented by LRAs to cope with increasing public expenditure entail transferring the pressure away from the institutional setting, by making it easier for those in need to live independently in residential or community settings. Several measures aim to enable the elderly to stay at home as long as possible, thus reducing the amount of hospitalisation and increasing the amount of home-delivered care. To this end, ICT support is fundamental and there are many examples of LRAs capitalising on new technologies for the delivery of eHealth or eCare services. This is particularly attractive for peripheral and rural areas where distances from support structures limit access to services, especially for those with limited mobility such as the elderly and the disabled. ICT will not only impact on the location of healthcare service provision; it will also affect the storage and use of medical data, safety and effectiveness of treatment, communication with patients, as well as care costs and efficiency, contributing overall to the reduction of health inequalities. However, these depend on the existence of adequate IT infrastructure, satisfactory interoperability levels, data protection mechanisms, process redesign, knowledge and skills management and the coordination of care delivery, all of which are difficult to find together in individual initiatives. Thus, electronic care is usually made available at local and regional level where investments in infrastructure and processes were made in the past, or through the ",
        "88 sub-contracting of services to external, private service providers. Electronic care is not considered the only solution; alternative forms of care for the elderly are being sought by LRAs at community level to deal with the fact that socially speaking, family ties and relationships have changed. This type of \u2018community assistance\u2019 often involves voluntary services. Addressing an increasing demand for (quality) services The social care sector needs to become more demand-driven and, accordingly, LRAs have developed solutions for securing innovative business development, mainstreaming services and matching demand and supply mechanisms, although most of the solutions seem to focus mainly on responding to concerns rather than facilitating prevention. Additionally, demand-driven services are often associated with the payment of charges and even though exemptions are granted on the basis of age or income criteria, the danger is that the introduction of market mechanisms within the care business would hinder accessibility. Dealing with a limited workforce Creating the right conditions for the social care sector to become more demand- driven entails the need to secure a workforce of sufficient size. This would also represent a great opportunity for transforming the challenge of an ageing population into job creation in health and social services. Nevertheless, measures taken by LRAs show that telecare and mainstreaming aim to achieve greater efficiency in personnel management, while community care is often provided with support from non-profit organisations. Mobility and accessibility Improving the accessibility of transport facilities Most common measures by LRAs include investment in infrastructure for adaptation and modernisation purposes; this entails the replacement of old vehicle fleets or the adaptation of existing vehicles with platforms, or the improvement of bus and tram stops with more accessible boarding/alighting areas and improved visibility. Some regions face peculiar topographic conditions that require specific measures to make pedestrian routes or the public transport network accessible. Easy access to these areas is a pre-condition for the use of sustainable means of transport or of public transport. Finally, accessibility is also meant in terms of availability and clarity of information on transport routes, transport facilities, ticketing and payment systems. ",
        "89 Increasing availability of means of transport Increasing availability of transport to the elderly, possibly through a range of means that respond to different needs and circumstances, is also fostered by LRAs, both in urban and rural areas. While in urban areas the additional means of transport aim to provide flexible and tailored services according to demand, in rural areas the main concern is still to facilitate access to basic services such as health and care. Providing demand-driven public transport systems Improved availability of means of transport is often demand-driven, as transport services are paid for and are therefore subject to market mechanisms. As ageing customers are on the increase, it is likely that their expectations in terms of cleanliness, punctuality and reliability will increasingly be met. However, it has been noted that some LRAs do not confine themselves to meeting demand passively, but try to foster a behavioural change in the elderly towards, for example, more sustainable modes of transport than private cars, such as walking, cycling and public transport, without reducing their mobility potential, thus maintaining their autonomy and well-being. Adapted housing Satisfying elderly people's desire for independent living There are several housing schemes run by LRAs, often through wholly or partially publicly owned companies or in collaboration with private stakeholders. It is also very common for these schemes, besides offering barrier- free apartments, to be associated with the delivery of relevant services such as health and care services, general assistance and household support. Thus, there has been a trend towards the association of builders and housing associations with service providers for offering attractive packages to the elderly. Usually these schemes entail the development of new houses, but there are also measures aimed at the adaptation of existing housing stock. Developing an opportunity for economic growth offered by new markets Domotics is a potentially profitable market segment and there is evidence of attempts to build economic clusters around it, bringing together service providers and knowledge institutions within a wider framework of regional economic growth and development. Combating inequalities and the financial divide within the older generation Social housing schemes tailored to the needs of the elderly also exist, as do strategies and supporting financial mechanisms making adaptation financially accessible to all, enabling living conditions for the elderly to improve equally for everyone. One example is the \u2018inter-generational housing\u2019 approach through ",
        "90 which families hosting older relatives are given support for the renovation of their homes (CECODHAS Housing Europe, 2009). Participation in community activities Combating the vulnerability of older people to social exclusion There are examples of diverse strategies by LRAs supporting the active involvement of older people in social activities, especially in voluntary work where they can provide an effective contribution if the right framework conditions exist. Inter-generational approaches are often used, creating interaction with younger generations, frequently on a collaborative basis. Additionally, there is a tendency to create representative bodies of the elderly in the community, to ensure their voice is heard in planning and priority-setting. Reducing the inter-generational digital divide In several cases, ICT is considered to be a tool for social inclusion rather than a constraint to participation, showing that the internet and other new technologies may be handled adequately by older people if they are given the proper training. 10.2 Characterisation of the types of region Apart from social inclusion and access to social services, for which no significant differences in the type of measures were noted across regions, some correlation for the other policy areas addressed by this report was found between types of region, on the one hand, and prevailing solutions undertaken by LRAs on the other. It is to be noted that this characterisation builds on evidence gathered through the examples set out in chapter 9 (summarised in Table 5) and is, therefore, unavoidably constrained by the limited number of initiatives being examined.

Type 1 regions These regions are found mainly in the UK, Finland, Benelux, and in the northern part of France. Regions where there are capital cities such as Madrid, Wien, Budapest, Athens, Warsaw, and Bratislava also belong to type 1. Type 1 regions have dynamic and innovative conditions for growth; additionally, their demographic tendencies are positive, with a relatively young and growing population. The most evident differences compared to the other types relate to employment, social care, transport and, to a lesser extent, housing. With respect to the labour market, these regions tackle stability and economic growth through the promotion of equal opportunities for all; thus, their focus - rather than on attracting labour force - is on the promotion of social cohesion. In terms of social care, they appear to be the most active in looking for innovative solutions entailing business innovation and services mainstreaming, while in the transport sector they foster service rationalisation for improving the quality and efficiency of the public transport sector through, for example, coordination and common scheduling and ticketing. Rationalisation and integration is also noted in housing-related measures, as housing schemes are intended to be one-stop-shops for the elderly, where housing and services are integrated through the coordinated participation of several service providers. ",
        "94 Type 2 regions These regions are found mainly in the UK, Scandinavia and Benelux, in western parts of Germany characterised by the presence of major cities (Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg), in the southern part of France and in the northern part of Italy. Some other regions where there are capital cities such as Lisbon and Lazio also belong to type 2. Type 2 regions experience dynamic and innovative conditions for growth but their demographic changes, although the population is increasing, are characterised by population ageing. In type 2 regions there are initiatives aiming to enhance the employability of older people, probably driven by over-the-average values of the old age dependency ratio that call for the preservation of the workforce in the labour market. There is evidence of \u2018active\u2019 public transport measures aiming not only at the empowerment of the elderly through information campaigns, but also at influencing their transport behaviour, steering them towards the use of more sustainable modes than cars, a response to the ageing of a \u2018driving generation\u2019 which may tend to keep their driving habits in old age. Housing schemes have a more marked social dimension compared to the examples in type 1. Type 3 regions These regions are found mainly in coastal areas of southern Spain, in Portugal (Norte region), Cyprus, Malta and Northern Ireland and in some parts of Austria, Poland and Slovenia. Type 3 regions have favourable demographic conditions (relatively low old age dependency ratio and growing population) but have not very dynamic or poor economic conditions. With regard to employment, there is evidence of some concern for the impact of the restructuring process on both economies and workforce. From type 3 onwards, the focus of measures undertaken in the transport sector seems to be on improving infrastructure and equipment, especially in terms of lowering physical barriers. In the housing sector, solutions allowing for ageing in place are still viewed in an integrated manner, i.e. providing housing and care services through both business and community-care models. Type 4 regions These regions are found mainly in Portugal, central parts of Spain, western and northern parts of France, central and northern parts of Italy, Greece, Sweden and eastern parts of Austria. Type 4 regions have growing but ageing populations and have not very dynamic or poor economic conditions. They include a predominance of rural areas. Examples for type 4 regions are clearly influenced by the predominance of rural conditions. For the employment of older workers, the Extremadura initiative ",
        "95 dealing with the crisis in the sheep and goat sector which may be common to several other rural settings and which, overall, contributes to the downturn in the regional economy, for which specific measures to retain the workforce and revitalise the sector have been undertaken. Adapted housing is also included in the selected example for this type of region, in a wider framework of regional and economic development. As for type 3, measures in the transport sector still seem to be for improving infrastructure and equipment. Type 5 regions Most of the type 5 regions can be found in Germany. Notwithstanding a strong economy these regions are all characterised by a declining and ageing population, making demographic changes a top priority on the policy agenda. In type 5, as well as in types 6 and 7, initiatives undertaken in the employment policy area relate to older workers re-entering the labour market, mainly driven by a declining population. With regard to transport, the example concerns tailored and door-to-door services for older people, delivered on a demand-and- charge-basis; this attention to the older segment of the population in the daily operation of LRAs is also evident in matters pertaining to adapted housing, where the municipality offers a permanent advice service to the elderly for staying independent as long as possible in their homes by means of adaptation or temporary housing partnerships with young people. Type 6 regions These regions are found mainly in the northern parts of Portugal, Spain, and Greece, as well as in the southern parts of Italy. Also a few regions in Bulgaria belong to type 6. Type 6 regions have the same demographic conditions as type 5, i.e. declining and ageing population, exacerbated by a poor or not very dynamic economy. Type 6 regions promote older workers re-entering the labour market, with measures often implemented as part of wider efforts to revitalise the economy and promote entrepreneurship. In transport, the focus is still on improving infrastructure and equipment, while adapted housing is still fostered through housing schemes, although in the example mentioned, the scheme is characterised by affordable prices proportionate to the economic conditions of the tenants. Type 7 regions These regions are found mainly in the EU12 Member States. Type 7 regions have a relatively young but declining population, and weak economies. Several type 7 regions are affected by economic migration. Since accession, ",
        "96 EU12 countries have been experiencing outward migration to EU15 labour markets, particularly younger and skilled workers, a trend that could be reversed as a consequence of the economic downturn. On the other hand, inward migration to EU12 countries is mostly focussed on regions or capitals characterised by dynamic economies. Thus, type 7 regions concentrate on attracting and/or retaining potential economic migrants. No examples of initiatives by LRAs were found for transport and adapted housing. ",
