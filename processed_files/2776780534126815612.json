        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 6 Executive summary This summary presents the key conclusions of the mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) 1 , referred to from here onwards as the \u2018EU Framework\u2019. The EU Framework was adopted in 2011 and its main objectives were to tackle poverty, social exclusion, and discrimination of the Roma by promoting their equal access to education, employment, health and housing in the EU and in enlargement countries. The Framework set four key objectives (referred to as Roma integration goals) that Member States were invited to endorse: ensure that all Roma children complete primary school, close the gaps between Roma and non-Roma in respect to employment, health status, and access to housing and public utilities (water, electricity). It recommended structural preconditions (such as the existence of a National Roma Integration Strategy) and specific measures per policy area to be taken by the Member States to achieve the Roma integration goals. The 2013 Enlargement Strategy further identified access to civil documentation an important issue that needs to be addressed. The mid-term evaluation covers the 2011-2017 period. It assesses the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, coordination, equity 2 , sustainability and the EU added value of EU Framework. It is based on a desk review of secondary literature, reports and databases; eleven in-depth country studies 3 ; interviews with experts in sixteen other EU Member States and at the EU level 4 , and in enlargement countries 5 ; an Open Public Consultation, a survey of NGOs; and a validation workshop with stakeholders from the EU and enlargement countries. The EU Framework encouraged Member States and enlargement countries to adopt a comprehensive approach to Roma integration and socio-economic inclusion, to mainstream Roma inclusion into policy, legal and funding instruments, to adopt National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS), to setup coordination, consultation, and monitoring mechanisms. The present analysis showed that the EU Framework objectives set in 2011 were appropriate to the needs of Roma at the time. The objectives in respect to health, housing, and employment continue to be relevant today. However, some factors have limited the relevance of the EU Framework. While emphasis on primary and compulsory education is important, the education objectives lacked ambition, and would better correspond to the needs of Roma if they addressed early childhood education and care (ECEC) as well as transition to secondary education and secondary education enrolment. Anti-discrimination and anti-Gypsyism, which are on a rise, were also insufficiently addressed. The needs of some sub-groups, namely children, women, EU-mobile Roma and third county Roma migrants were also insufficiently considered. The EU Framework contributed to a coherent approach in mainstreaming Roma integration into EU level funding and mainstream policies. At EU-level, progress has been made particularly in mainstreaming Roma inclusion into the European Semester of Europe 2020 and the European Structural and Investment Funds 2014-2020. This has been less the case at national level, both in Member States and enlargement 1 EC. 2011. An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 - COM(2011)173.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 7 countries, where little additional funding and only partial mainstreaming of NRIS objectives into mainstream policies was found. The EU Framework has led to some progress towards the achievement of the Roma integration goals but its effectiveness has been limited and unequal across Member States. Even though overall discriminatory attitudes in accessing public services have decreased, discrimination in accessing employment and housing remains high. In education the gaps between Roma and non-Roma have been reduced in enrolment rates in ECEC and compulsory education in most countries, as well as in early school leaver rates. In employment , the unemployment rate of Roma remains high due to the overall labour market situation in the EU (up until early 2016) and high levels of discrimination. The gap between Roma and non-Roma in accessing housing remains unchanged, largely due to the absence of any significant policy measures or investment. In respect to health , the self-reported health situation of Roma has improved, but there was no evidence that assesses the actual health situation to support these perceptions. The health insurance coverage has regressed in some countries. Resources have been activated and there is more investment in Roma inclusion, primarily through the EU funding following the adoption of the EU Framework. Funding has come from various European funds, but the largest investments were made through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and EU Instrument for Pre- Accession (IPA). Member States coordination mechanisms are now established but their functioning is limited and not well consolidated. The NRISs do not connect well to the mainstream policies by involving key departments and stakeholders in a consistent way. The appointed National Roma Contact Points in most Member States have limited institutional weight and lack capacity and powers to coordinate NRIS implementation. The necessary nature of multi-sector and multilevel interventions have been creating administrative burdens that have not yet translated into results on the ground. In terms of the sustainability of the EU Framework in the post-2020 era, in principle there is commitment but in practice the post-2020 sustainability of the EU Framework is questioned for three main reasons. First, continuity of funding for initiatives in the post-2020 period is not yet guaranteed, especially if the EU funding stops. Second, guaranteeing continuation of programmes and projects requires a longer timeframe than the existing timeframe of the EU Framework. Third, existing mechanisms are still in the process of consolidation and might become symbolic rather than integral in the policy-making process if the framework does not continue. This does not mean that none of the benefits will be sustainable in the future. Benefits in education and, in some Member States, in employment (on which educational effects obviously have a delayed impact), are more likely to last as they are part of a cultural change at individual and community level. Changes in other areas though would need more time and resources to bring long-term results. A mechanism is also needed to ensure sustainability is taken into account when policies are implemented. The EU added value of the Framework is significant. Although progress is limited, the Framework put Roma inclusion on the EU and national agendas, raising attention also in countries with smaller Roma communities. EU action is stimulating national actions in terms of fostering political will and ownership of the issues and encouraging integrated and comprehensive policy approaches involving all relevant government levels and civil society representatives. EU action is still needed to promote Roma inclusion. In the absence of the EU Framework, Member States would most likely have gone into a different direction, or taken a different approach, which would not have achieved the same results. Having no EU framework would lead to less of a policy focus on and a strong decrease of available funding for Roma inclusion, as well as less and looser monitoring and reporting on the situation. The EU Framework is the beginning of a process that, despite many limitations and taking into account the massive task ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 8 involved, has shown positive results and an initial change in trends. Member States alone could not have achieved these same results. Regarding equity in the treatment of all Roma, the EU Framework addresses the different needs of vulnerable subgroups within the Roma population only to a limited extent. The EU Framework would benefit from a much stronger focus on multiple and intersectional discrimination. Despite increasing focus at EU level on the fight against discrimination and anti-Gypsyism, awareness raising activities implemented in several countries appear insufficient to halt and break down the rising levels of discrimination and anti-Gypsyism throughout the EU.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 9 1 Introduction 1.1 The EU Framework for NRIS The Roma 6 are the largest ethnic minority in Europe, consisting of approximately 11.3 million people, of which about 6.2 million live in the EU 7 . Many of them suffer from social exclusion and poverty. Moreover, as an ethnic group, Roma are exposed to individual and structural discrimination. For over a decade now, European institutions and many Member States have been concerned about the situation of the Roma, acknowledging in a series of Council conclusions that there was room for significant improvement in policies to tackle the issue more effectively 8 . In the years preceding the EU Framework, a number of interventions were made at the European level to address the issues facing Roma across Europe, in a series of Communications. In 2008, the European Commission adopted a Communication titled \u2018Non-discrimination and equal opportunities: A renewed commitment\u2019 in which it clearly stated that the situation of the Roma, in terms of persistent discrimination and social exclusion, was indefensible in the context of social cohesion, economic prosperity and the enjoyment of basic human rights 9 . In 2010, a Communication on \u2018The social and economic integration of Roma in Europe\u2019 was adopted by the Commission 10 . This Communication defined the multiple, and often interdependent, issues the Roma face with regard to poverty, discrimination, labour- market barriers, ill-health and poor educational achievements. It stated the importance of employing an integrated approach to achieve change in these areas, and that European Structural Funds 11 should be better implemented to this end. One year later, the Commission launched a 2011 Communication on an EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 12 (EU Framework), in accordance with the goals of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 13 , following the European Parliament\u2019s 6 The term \u201cRoma\u201d is used here, in line with the terminology of European institutions and international organisations, to refer to a number of different groups (such as Roma, Sinti, Kale, Gypsies, Romanichels, Boyash, Ashkali, Egyptians, Yenish, Dom, Lom, Rom, Abdal) and also includes Travellers, without denying the specificities and varieties of lifestyles and situations of these groups. 7 Council of Europe estimate available at: https://www.coe.int/bg/web/portal/roma 8 See, for instance: European Commission, \u2018Communication on an EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020\u2019, COM (2011); Council of the European Union, \u2018Council Recommendation on Effective Roma Integration Measures in the Member States\u2019, 2013/C 378/01 (2013); Council of the European Union, \u2018Conclusions of 8 December 2016 on Accelerating the Process of Roma Integration\u2019, 15406/16 (2016). 9 European Commission, \u2018Non-discrimination and equal opportunities: A renewed commitment\u2019, COM (2008) 420 final, p. 9, available at http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=88&langId=en&eventsId=105&furtherEvents=yes. 10 European Commission, \u2018The social and economic integration of the Roma in Europe\u2019, COM (2010) 133, accompanied by Commission Staff Working Document of 7 April 2010.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 10 Resolution of 9 March 2011 on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion. 14 This Communication called upon EU Member States to support the proposed EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) by drawing up, or developing existing, NRIS, in order to reinforce EU policy on equality, and to outline a range of goals related to Roma integration at national, regional and local levels. Goals were outlined and defined in the EU Framework, and in accordance with the European Semester of 2020, that advocated for the inclusive reform of mainstream policies in each Member State. Specifically, Member States were called on to address the following crucial areas: access to education, to employment, to healthcare, and to housing. The horizontal issue of discrimination was also an area that had to be addressed. In 2011, Council conclusions on an EU Framework on National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 15 endorsed the call for Member States to update existing NRIS or integrated policy measures, or define new ones, which had been laid out in the 2011 Communication. Accordingly, all Member States (excluding Malta) submitted their NRIS or integrated policy measures, which were assessed by the Commission in 2012, and each Member State established a National Roma Contact Point (NRCP) 16 . The EU Framework was reinforced in 2013 through a Council Recommendation. This provided the EU with a Roma-specific soft-law instrument for the first time. It introduced an annual reporting obligation for Member States from 2016, thus signifying further significant steps made with regard to the establishment of a European-wide system of monitoring. The 2013 Council Recommendation also substantiated many of the goals defined in the EU Framework by providing more granular priorities with regard to the four priority areas, and the horizontal issues of discrimination, and social inclusion and poverty. A more comprehensive overview of the key elements of the Framework, including the substantiated features of the 2013 Council Recommendation, are provided in the next section. This was accompanied by the Communication on the Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2013-2014, in which Roma inclusion was confirmed as an integral aspect of the EUs values regarding fundamental rights 17 . 1.2 Key elements of the EU Framework Based on the commitment to equal treatment, tackling discrimination and poverty, the main objective of the EU Framework is to close the gap between Roma and non-Roma in four key socio-economic areas: education, employment, health and housing 18 The Communication asked that the Member States adopt or develop further a 2013), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.

It underlined that the primary responsibility for addressing welfare issues (including for their Roma populations) fell on the Member States themselves, and to the local and regional authorities responsible for those respective issues. The Communication also advised Member States to: \uf0b7 \u2018Set achievable national goals for Roma integration to bridge the gap with the general population\u2019, addressing as a minimum, \u2018the four integration goals related to access to education, employment, healthcare and housing\u2019; \uf0b7 \u2018Identify where relevant those disadvantaged micro-regions or segregated neighbourhoods, where communities are most deprived, using already available socio-economic and territorial indicators\u2019; \uf0b7 \u2018Allocate a sufficient funding from national budgets, which will be complemented, where appropriate, by international and EU funding\u2019; \uf0b7 \u2018Include strong monitoring methods to evaluate the impact of Roma integration actions and a review mechanism for the adaptation of the strategy\u2019. The Communication also refers to the promotion of Roma integration and the same objectives beyond the EU, given that Roma in enlargement countries face the same, or \u2018even more serious\u2019 problems than is the case in EU Member States 19 . Following the adoption of the Framework, the Council endorsed it calling on Member States \u2018to prepare, update or develop their NRIS, or integrated sets of policy measures within their broader social inclusion policies.\u2019 20 In 2013 the Council stepped up efforts for the implementation of the EU Framework, by adopting a Recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States 21 . The Recommendation is important as it serves as guidance to Member States in implementing their NRIS or policy measures. Specifically, the document recommends the implementation of effective policy measures across the four key policy areas, while reformulating some of the objectives put forward by the 2011 Communication. Attention is paid to the horizontal policy measures such as anti-discrimination, poverty reduction through social investment and the protection of Roma children. Anti-Gypsyism is specifically invoked as a unique form of discrimination and prejudice directed at Roma. The Recommendation draws attention to the importance of implementing structural measures, such as the monitoring and evaluation of policies and local action, and how this can enable \u2018efficient reporting on the situation of the Roma\u2019 22 . The need to develop \u2018local action plans or strategies\u2019 is stressed as a means of achieving Roma integration, particularly in the context of Roma families 23 . Of added significance is the fact that the 2013 Council recommendation is the first EU legal instrument to address Roma inclusion. The table below outlines the goals articulated in both the 2011 Framework and 2013 Council Recommendation, paying particular attention to how the Council Recommendation supplement the original goals outlined in the Framework.

Objectives of the 2011 EU Framework and the 2013 Council Recommendation Policy focus 2011 EU Framework 2013 Council Recommendation Discrimination General objective: Member States need to ensure that Roma are not discriminated against, but are treated like any other EU citizen with equal access to all fundamental rights. Member States should: implement desegregation measures, at a regional and local level, with regard to Roma by focusing on human rights protection; employ awareness raising efforts to inform the general public on the problems faced by Roma and the benefits of successful integration; combat anti-Roma hate speech; implement measures that tackle anti- Gypsyism. Social Inclusion/Poverty General objective: Break the cycle of poverty by adopting strong and proportionate measures to tackle the social and economic problems of Roma. Roma integration goals will contribute to progress made in reaching the aims of Europe 2020 strategy and be in line with national reform programmes in this context. Invest in human capital and social cohesion policies in the context of mainstream policies. Roma integration should be linked to programmes on national reform (under Europe 2020), in countries with large Roma populations. National Roma integration should be a priority in line with national reform measures in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy. Education Roma Integration Goal: Ensure that all Roma children complete as a minimum, primary school education. Member States should: \u2018strengthen links with communities\u2019 and \u2018improve the cultural competences of teachers\u2026 to ensure compliance with the duty to primary school attendance\u2019; \u2018reduce the number of early school leavers pursuant to the Europe 2020 strategy\u2019. Ensure equal treatment and full access to quality and mainstream education and ensure that all Roma pupils complete as a minimum, compulsory education. Measures to include: \u2018eliminating any school segregation\u2019; reducing early school leaving throughout all levels of education\u2019; \u2018considering the needs of individual pupils and addressing those accordingly, in close cooperation with their families\u2019; \u2018using inclusive and tailor-made teaching and learning methods\u2019; \u2018encouraging greater parental involvement and improving teacher training\u2019. Employment Roma Integration Goal: Cut the employment gap between Roma and the rest of the population. Member States should: \u2018grant Roma people full access in a non-discriminatory way to vocational training, to the job market and to self- employment tools and Ensure equal treatment of Roma in access to the labour market and to employment opportunities. Measures to include: \u2018supporting first work experience, vocational training, on-the-job training, lifelong learning and skills development\u2019; \u2018supporting self-employment and entrepreneurship\u2019; \u2018providing equal access to mainstream public employment services, alongside ",

Notable key points that the Recommendation makes (and which are not explicitly referenced in the Framework) include the need to invest in human and social cohesion policies to tackle the poverty faced by Roma and that access to healthcare and provision of services necessarily includes sexual and reproductive healthcare. In regard to housing, the Council Recommendation stresses that local authorities should prioritise allocating regeneration projects in favour of marginalised communities (such as the Roma), and that ESIF could be used to support investment in community-led local development, in the context of Roma housing; additionally, the need to prioritise desegregation measures is reinforced, while spatial segregation is cited as something that must be eliminated.

In the context of employment, opportunities for first-time work experience are advocated to enable Roma participation in the labour market. 1.3 Objectives of the mid-term evaluation The aim of the present evaluation is to assess the implementation and the achievements of the EU Framework for NRIS between 2011 and 2017. It also aims to assess the development, use, and alignment of the European and national mainstream and targeted policy, legal and funding instruments to address Roma integration. As the Commission holds no direct competences over the policy areas covered under the Framework, the evaluation addresses also the impacts of national policy, legal and funding instruments. In particular the focus is on the extent to which the goal of improving Roma access to education, employment, healthcare and housing has been achieved in the EU (and reflected in the enlargement region). This mid-term evaluation will help contribute to future decision-making in the context of Roma integration. The present study assesses relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, coordination, equity, sustainability and the EU added value of EU Framework for NRIS; these criteria comprise the scope of the evaluation. The coordination, equity and sustainability criteria were added to the other five, obligatory criteria. For each evaluation criterion, a series of evaluation questions were composed. Where necessary, to avoid overlaps, evaluation questions have been combined. The evaluation criteria and their pertinence to the evaluation are outlined below: Relevance assesses the extent to which the EU Framework\u2019s objectives of fighting discrimination, poverty and improving Roma access to education, employment, healthcare and housing were and are still pertinent to the needs of preventing social and economic exclusion and discrimination of Roma. There are two key dimensions in assessing the relevance of the intervention: \uf0b7 The rationale for the intervention: the needs of the Roma with regard to access to mainstream education, employment, healthcare, housing and in facing general discrimination, which the intervention looks to tackle, are analysed; \uf0b7 The overall strategic fit: how the EU Framework relates to the national and EU policy agenda and overall commitments to tackling discrimination and racism, inclusive education, health, employment or housing policies. Coherence addresses two dimensions: the potential for synergies between the EU Framework and other similar policies at the EU and national level, and the extent to which legal, political and financial instruments were well aligned. With regard to the first dimension, the coherence criterion looks to ascertain the extent to which the Framework does not contradict or overlaps with but complements other interventions, at the EU and national level, which have similar objectives or scope. The second element of this evaluation criterion assesses how well European level policy (e.g., the European Semester), legal (EU antidiscrimination and anti-racism legislation) and financial instruments (ESIF 2014-2020 and IPA 2014-2020) were utilised and aligned by the Commission and the countries in order to accomplish the objectives of the EU Framework. Effectiveness assesses the extent to which the key objectives of the EU Framework have been (or are likely to be) achieved so far. Of particular importance is assessing the extent to which the EU Framework has contributed to tackling discrimination, fighting poverty and improving Roma access to education, healthcare, employment and housing. Efficiency assesses the extent to which the results of an intervention have been achieved at a reasonable cost. Answering this question necessarily involves assessing the balance between the financial and human resources, administrative instruments and government structures that have been employed and the effects that were realised.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 15 EU Added Value looks at the extent to which activities initiated under the EU Framework, and changes in the situation of the Roma (with regard to inclusion and non- discrimination) would have taken place regardless of EU direction. The need for the potential continuation of EU level action is considered in order to achieve the goals outlined in the Framework and Council Recommendation, in addition to the potential consequences of stopping it. Coordination examines how interventions (including policy, legal and funding instruments and monitoring measurements) were, and are currently organised in the context of the EU Framework, and whether they have been coordinated in a way to maximise their joint effects. This evaluation criterion covers the coordination and cooperation at multiple levels of governance: EU, national, regional and local and cooperation with/participation of the civil society. Equity assesses the extent to which EU Framework results have been achieved in a proportional and fair manner with respect to vulnerable groups within the Roma, specifically those whose vulnerability gender and migration-status. Accordingly, it looks at how the EU Framework has addressed the specific needs of Roma women, Roma youth and children. Equity is considered as a distinct evaluation criterion although closely related to the effectiveness criterion. Sustainability assesses the extent to which effects stemming from the Framework are likely to last after the intervention and the related mechanisms and policies in place end. It constitutes its own evaluation criterion because a key purpose of the evaluation is that it will serve to advise EU Roma policy interventions up until 2020, and then beyond. Consequently, assessing the EU Framework\u2019s sustainability is a priority with need for its own devoted evaluation criterion. 1.3.1 Scope of the evaluation This mid-term evaluation has both a defined thematic and geographic scope, and data used throughout covers the 2011-2016 period for EU Member States, and the 2011- 2017 period for those enlargement countries covered . The thematic focus centres around the objectives of the EU Framework with regard to addressing the issues of poverty, discrimination, and the four thematic areas: education, employment, health and housing. More precisely, the thematic scope of the evaluation captures, amongst other points: the development, use and alignment of EU-level legal, financial and policy instruments relevant to Roma integration; the implementation of NRIS and specific Roma integration measures; the role of NRIS in mainstreaming Roma inclusion; how EU and national funds have been employed in NRIS implementation; and of the use of the thematic ex ante conditionality No 9ii \u2018A national Roma inclusion strategic policy framework is in place\u2019 on the quality of the Framework, and which is linked to a Roma-specific investment priority 24 . It should be noted that there are a number of measures and policies which are not covered by the EU Framework (e.g. access to justice, political participation, or culture), and so are outside the scope of the evaluation. In terms of geographic scope , the main focus of the evaluation is the EU Member States and three enlargement countries. The data collected, as described in the next chapter, focused on the 27 EU Member States, with the exception of Malta (which has not adopted a NRIS/sets of policies due to having no Roma population). In addition to the 27 Member States, data was collected for three enlargement countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia. Turkey, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro have been examined through desk research only, and so although referenced, are not a main focus of the evaluation. 24 On the socio-economic integration of marginalised communities such as Roma.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 19 1.4 Intervention logic This section outlines the intervention logic for the EU Roma Framework. The rational for the adoption of the EU Framework was the realisation that high- levels of socio-economic exclusion and discrimination of Roma was an issue that required action on Member State and EU level. The issues of exclusion in particular regarding education, employment, health, and housing were considered to be most pressing. The expectation was that by eliminating discrimination and social gaps with the majority population, there will be social and economic benefits for both, Roma and non-Roma alike. 25 Therefore, the policy response was adoption of the EU Framework, a novel strategic tool that had not been used before by the European Commission to steer Member State actions. With this tool the European Commission encouraged Member States to develop NRIS following a comprehensive approach to Roma integration and socio-economic inclusion, to mainstream Roma inclusion into policy, legal and funding instruments. The objectives of the EU Framework, presented in Section 1.2, were supposed to be relevant to the needs to tackle social exclusion and discrimination. The Framework was supposed to mobilise or establish in a coherent way a number of policy instruments and governance structures ( inputs ) that were to contribute to the implementation of the Framework. These instruments and structures are listed in the figure below. The structures were meant to be established both at EU and national level, and in some Member States even on regional or local level. The Framework was targeting Member States, as well as enlargement countries. The European Commission mobilised instruments, such as the European Semester of the Europe 2020 strategy, and EU funding, such as the ESIF and the Instrument for Pre- Accession Assistance (IPA). 26 After the adoption of the NRIS, Member State institutions were supposed to allocate funds for targeted policy measures as well as to mainstream the goals of their national Roma integration strategies into mainstream public policies in education, employment, healthcare and housing. The Commission provided guidance and monitoring of Member States\u2019 actions on Roma inclusion, both under the EU Framework and the European Semester (which promotes the inclusive reform of mainstream policies), and provided Member States with country- specific recommendations (CSRs). These have been adopted by the Council since 2012 for 5 Member States (and focused on education and labour market inclusion, as well as poverty reduction). The CSRs served also as a basis for identifying funding priorities in the in the 2014-2020 ESIF. 27 Member States, and enlargement countries, were expected to implement their NRIS, using efficiently national and EU resources, as well as to monitor the implementation in cooperation with regional and local authorities and civil society. There were three levels of effects expected: outputs, outcomes, and impacts. The key outputs that were supposed to be generated by the European and Member State institutions, included increased funding and number of beneficiaries, as well as a greater number of effective targeted and mainstream policy measures. The key outcomes 2011-2020 of the intervention were the achievement of the objectives: the reduced gap in education, employment, health, and housing between Roma and non-Roma, as well as reduced levels of discrimination. Some of the outcomes of the Framework are 25 COM(2011)173 26 COM(2015) 299, Communication from the commission to the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions, Report on the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2015 27 Article 4(1), REGULATION (EU) No 1303/2013 (CPR) ",

The expected key impacts include the social and economic benefits for the Roma and EU societies - positive impact of GDP from improved educational outputs, increased incomes, and the economic and social impact from Roma inclusion in the labour market, improved social cohesion. The achieved outcomes from these interventions were expected to generate sustainable and lasting effects for the Roma and for European Societies. It was also foreseen that EU level intervention was needed, and EU level action (through means of funding, guidance, coordination and reporting) would have achieved better outcomes and outputs rather than Member States acting alone. Some factors were known and considered at the time of the adoption of the Framework, such as the long-time needed to achieve the results, the high levels of discrimination that would prevent some goals from being quickly or fully achieved, as well as the political will required to achieve the objectives. Other external factors could not have foreseen but have certainly impacted the implementation of the EU Framework, including: the role of social media in promoting discriminatory language and anti- Gypsyism; the rise of nationalist parties across Europe in line with Brexit; and the 2015 refugee crisis (as this can often be the root of anti-Roma rhetoric).

Ever since the first studies and reports of European Institutions on the situation of the Roma, it was clear that systematic and in-depth knowledge of the situation of the Roma was missing 28 . Information was largely collected and available due to efforts of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Central and Eastern Europe 29 and the Decade of Roma inclusion, which covered seven EU Member States and 5 enlargement countries 30 . Therefore, the baselines sources referred to in the 2011 Communication refer to partial studies covering few Member States 31 . The first systematic (but still partial) effort of EU institutions to map the situation of the Roma in Member States where Roma could be surveyed with quantitative methods took place following the adoption of the EU Framework in 2011 \u2013 the Fundamental Rights Agency survey of 11 EU Member States 32 . At the time of the adoption of the EU Framework in 2011, EU Member States were bound by equality and non-discrimination obligations under international human rights legal instruments, such as the International Conventions on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the European Social Charter (ESC) 33 . In terms of EU instruments, Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (the Racial Equality Directive) set key safeguards against discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin in accessing education, employment, healthcare and housing, among others 34 . With the aim to tackle racism and xenophobia, the Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia 2008/913/JHA criminalises hate speech in the form of publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race or ethnic origin. It also requires that racist motives become an aggravating circumstance of crimes leading to harsher punishment. Before the 2011 Communication by the European Commission, the European Parliament brought increased attention to Roma issues 35 .

On average, 46% of Roma people surveyed in 2011 reported being subject to discrimination because of their Roma ethnicity in the last 12 months - ranging from around 60% in Italy, Czech Republic and Poland to around 30% in Romania, Bulgaria and Spain (FRA Roma survey 2011 40 ). Eurobarometer surveys from 2012 also provide insights into the prevalence and nature of discrimination faced by Roma. In 2012, when asked how comfortable citizens in their country would feel if their children had Roma schoolmates, 34% thought that citizens in their country would feel uncomfortable with such situation (28% fairly comfortable and 31% comfortable). The level of being uncomfortable with Roma varied between the countries, with the majority reporting being uncomfortable in Slovakia and the Czech Republic for example 41 . The discrimination the Roma faced across Europe in 2011 was multi-faceted and impacted access to education, employment, housing and health and generated further, wider forms of social exclusion and poverty. The specific manifestations of discrimination in respect to these different policy areas are discussed further down. Poverty A great number of Roma across Europe were reported as experiencing higher levels of poverty than the EU average prior to the adoption of the EU Framework: this relates to both income poverty, and poverty in a wider sense, i.e., a general lack of access to essential services and social resources and benefits 42 . The European Commission described the poverty situation facing the Roma as a \u2018vicious cycle\u2019 in its 2011 Communication 43 , thereby suggesting that the Roma were facing an entrenched and continually perpetuating form of poverty. A number of composite indicators were outlined as part of Europe 2020 strategy to measure deprivation across Europe. The level of material deprivation faced by the Roma was seen as revealing the extent of their housing and economic deprivation.

FRA data indicate that 73 % of those aged 25\u201364 in the general population completed at least secondary education compared to only 10 % of the Roma who took part in the survey 56 . In the meantime, Roma children were at a significantly higher risk of early school leaving and drop-out than non-Roma students. To illustrate the magnitude of the challenge, the share of early school leavers 57 in Greece was 98% among Roma, whilst 25% for non-Roma. In Slovakia, the results were 83% for Roma in contrast to 7% on non-Roma 58 . In addition, results of surveys carried out before the Framework show that on average 10% of Roma children attended classes where all classmates were Roma. 59 . Enrolling Roma children in such settings \u2013 i.e. often conserving socio-cultural differences and strengthening the feeling of social exclusion - has potential deterring effects on the quality of education delivered. In addition and more likely as a result of the above, existing evidence-based research also highlight the commonly shared sentiment among Roma children and their parents of discrimination when being in touch with the school 60 .

The employment and social dimensions of this crisis had to be addressed and they became among the essential elements of the Europe 2020 strategy, adopted in 2010. In line with the headline target of the Europe 2020 Strategy to ensure that 75% of the EU population aged 20-64 will have been employed by 2020, the EU Framework for NRIS set the goal to better access to employment for Roma people and cut the employment gap between Roma and the rest of population. At the time of its adoption, in some Member States and enlargement countries a range of initiatives were implemented aiming to increase Roma labour market participation under various initiatives such as the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 65 and Social Inclusion Action Plans 66 . To address Roma the predominant approaches were focused to promoting Roma employment and their entrance to the formal labour market especially in the context of ESF programmes. In 2011, Roma employment rate was much lower than that of the general population in most EU Member States and the enlargement countries, especially in respect to women and youth. According to FRA 2011 survey data the employment gap between Roma and the general population was 42.6%.

The results of the FRA Roma Survey (2011) also showed a substantial gender gap. On average, in the nine (9) countries surveyed, 62% of Roma women aged 16 to 24 years were neither in work nor in education (NEET), compared with 51% of young Roma men. It is worth noting that a significant low participation of Roma women in the labour markets was observed with only one out of five Roma women (20%) self-declare that have a \u201cpaid work. Moreover, based on the results of the same survey, more than half of the Roma young people (56%) were neither in employment nor in education or training (NEET), while in some Member States, around three-quarters of young Roma was neither in employment nor in education or training (PT 79%, HR 72%, ES 71%). These findings, despite the restricted comparability, show that there is a large gap with the general population where the NEET share was 12,9% in 2011 (Eurostat, EU-28). Access to the labour market was not so easy for Roma, as half of Roma people in 2011 felt being discriminated because of being Roma when looking for a job and 19% felt being discriminated at work (see Table 6 below).

Health Better access to healthcare is a right in itself (Article 35 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights). Improved health among children in general is linked with better educational outcomes and better socioeconomic conditions. Better access to healthcare, including health promotion and disease prevention, and health status among adults in general is rather related to universal health systems and positively influence productivity and economic outputs. Poor housing conditions may affect health status while poor accessible housing may limit access to healthcare. The poor health status of Roma is mainly due to the social determinants of health that affect members from all vulnerable groups 68 . Relevant factors include not only access to healthcare, but also other factors including education and housing. Multiple indicators highlight the health gap between Roma and non-Roma individuals in 2011 69 . Infant mortality among Roma has been estimated to be 2 to 6 times higher than the EU average 70 . Only 28% of Roma children had received all the required vaccinations , even when they were available for free through national programmes 71 . Among adults, life expectancy for Roma were estimated to be up to 20 years less than the average for non-Roma in the EU 72 . The key health indicators across nine countries indicated that in 2011, 55% of Roma reported to be in \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018good health\u2019 status. 73 . Roma women were more likely, especially those more advanced in age, to report that their health was very poor 74 . 78% of Roma responded that they have medical insurance coverage . Those who live in Roma-concentrated areas are less likely to have insurance relative to those living in areas where Roma are not the main population (74% as compared with 84%). With regards to medical visits , more than half of Roma women reported not visiting a gynaecologist for reasons other than pregnancy 75 . Roma also experience higher prevalence of communicable diseases , especially those living in segregated areas.

Overall the research process was split into inception, evidence gathering, and analytical phases, each resulting in corresponding reports. Inception phase The inception phase enabled the research team to further develop their understanding of the EU Framework, and the existing empirical data. This first phase led to the Inception Report, which outlined the agreed management process and (work, quality and risks) plans anticipated for the duration of the evaluation study. The Inception Report served as a reference document throughout the assignment, and presented the calibrated and further developed methodology and evaluation questions and indicators. Phase 1 played a fundamental part in establishing a solid foundation for the fruitful working partnership with the Steering Group. This phase consisted of the following key tasks: \uf0b7 Initial desk review of NRIS and sources provided a mapping of the existing secondary literature of interest to the evaluation, and determined the type and scope of data that would be ultimately extracted, and how datasets would be structured for the purpose of the evaluation. \uf0b7 Review of data in the Online Roma Integration Measures Reporting Tool \u2013 following the adoption of the 2013 Council Recommendation, annual reporting on the NRIS implementation commenced by Member States in 2016. The data in this tool includes summary of information on implemented policy measures, related funding and beneficiaries, governance and cooperation. At the time of the review, data for 2015 and 2016 was available. \uf0b7 EU level scoping interviews: 8 telephone and face to face interviews were conducted with DG JUST, FRA, and Roma umbrella NGOs, and experts on issues pertaining to Roma inclusion. 86 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Housing conditions of Roma and Travellers in the European Union, Comparative Report, Publications Office of the European Union, 2009, available at http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2011/housing-conditions-roma-and-travellers-european-union- comparative-report. 87 IPOL-FEMM_ET(2013)493019_EN Empowerment of Roma Women within the European Framework of National Roma Inclusion Strategies 88 BG, CY, CZ, FR, GR, HU, IT, LT, PL, PT, RO, SK, SI and ES 89 Peric, T.

The methods and techniques used to gather indicator values, and the proposed selection of case studies were also reviewed. Special attention was paid to the cost-benefit analysis. Evidence gathering phase The evidence gathering phase consisted of data collection and the preliminary assessment of the data collected. It consisted of: desk research; telephone interviews with targeted stakeholders from 16 Member States and enlargement countries; a survey of stakeholders across 28 Member States and the enlargement region; in-depth country analysis studies in 11 Member States. This phase consisted of the following tasks: \uf0b7 Desk research \u2013 data structuring and extraction of evidence from the available documentation, or additional sources that were identified during the Inception Phase. This research resulted in a comprehensive literature review and analysis of the use of EU funds for Roma inclusion, which were included in the Interim Report. \uf0b7 Targeted stakeholder consultations: A large-scale programme of in- depth semi-structured stakeholder interviews and surveys was conducted. In addition to the results of the OPC, the desk research, and case studies, this research activity served as a key source of evidence on the views held by stakeholders on the EU Framework and NRIS. Interviews that were conducted fell into three groups: o 138 interviews with relevant stakeholders across 11 Member States that fed directly into corresponding country case studies; o 53 interviews with relevant stakeholders across 16 Member States that did not feed into country case studies ; o 8 interviews with relevant stakeholders in 3 enlargement countries. \uf0b7 NGO targeted survey : an online survey was opened on January 16 th 2018 and ran until 23 rd February. The survey specifically targeted NGO representatives that had not taken part in the OPC. The reason behind targeting this particular stakeholder group was to ensure the comprehensive involvement of all civil society actors; it was additionally considered that other stakeholder groups would not respond positively to multiple consultations. In total, the survey was fully completed by 65 respondents. Country case studies: The country case studies comprised another of the main sources of qualitative information for the evaluation. The studies endeavoured to: extract detailed and contextual information from Member State reporting documents and policy specific materials; critically appraise the logic and causal chains identified in the intervention logic; balance the poor quantitative data on changes in discrimination patterns with qualitative assessments by stakeholders. Their purpose was not to assess the NRIS, but rather to collect sufficient evidence in order to draw conclusions about the EU Framework. Eleven country studies were undertaken in total (AT, BG, CZ, ES, EL, FR, FI, HU, IT, RO, SK). In each country between 15 and 20 (mostly) face to face interviews were conducted with central government, regional / local government, as well as Roma or pro-Roma NGOs. Review of secondary literature and NRIS implementation reports, and other relevant data was analysed. The country ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 34 studies were undertaken mostly by local experts with detailed knowledge of the local situation and prior experience with Roma issues. The country studies were not aiming to evaluate the National Roma Integration Strategies in the 11 Member States, but rather to collect available evidence and expert opinions and to provide data to draw EU level conclusions. These studies are provided separate from this report. Stakeholders Workshop: A workshop was organised and took place on European Commission premises in Brussels on 15 March 2018. The workshop brought together 88 stakeholders to receive the preliminary findings of the evaluation in alignment with the 8 evaluation dimensions and a presentation of the 5 main recommendations that had been formulated so far. The workshop also gave participants the opportunity to respond specifically to the effectiveness, EU added value, relevance and coherence of the EU Framework, and contribute in the form of recommendations for a potential post-2020 EU approach on Roma inclusion. After the workshop, the notes made throughout the day were compiled alongside the written recommendations that had been sent from certain stakeholders, and were analysed. Analysis Phase The analysis phase consisted of analysing the responses to the Open Public Consultation (OPC), the stakeholder consultations and the laying of the foundations for the final reporting and presentation of the triangulation and synthesis of all available evidence collected. This phase consisted of the following tasks: \uf0b7 Analysis of replies to the OPC: Analysis of the OPC were carried out following the principles of the Better Regulation Guidelines. Closed- ended questions, open-ended questions and written responses submitted outside of the Framework of the questionnaire were analysed using qualitative analytical techniques. The quantitative analysis of the OPC involved descriptive analysis of OPC respondents and a univariate analysis of other numerical data included in the OPC questionnaire. \uf0b7 Triangulation and synthesis: This task involved the systematic organisation of all quantitative and qualitative evidence collected from various secondary and primary sources. This involved coding and collating data collected with the aid of NVivo 90 , performing a sense check to ensure its reliability and transforming data into usable formats. \uf0b7 Sensitivity analysis . The calculations of the level of expenditure on Roma inclusion are based on assumptions and there are uncertainties about the quality of some of the underlying data. To illustrate this uncertainty, a sensitivity analysis of the financial information was undertaken. The sensitivity of the level of expenditure to changes in the calculation assumptions and input factors was tested in the sensitivity analysis. This was done by adjusting some of the underlying data and varying some of the assumptions used in the calculations. \uf0b7 Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative information to assess the costs and benefits (and potential costs and benefits) of spending on Roma inclusion. The MCA used in this study includes three steps: 90 NVivo is a qualitative data analysis computer software package. ",

Further information on the analytical approach and methodological approaches in this study is provided, in Annex 1 as well as in the Synopsis report on the Stakeholder consultations. Limitations and robustness of data Many of the conclusions in the present report are based on data from surveys, in particular the FRA\u2019s 2011 and 2016 rounds of the EU MIDIS survey and the WB/UNDP 2011 and 2017 Surveys on Western Balkans. This is necessary because official government statistics on Roma are generally not collected. It is already well known that a number of Member States oppose for ethical, political and/or legal reasons the collection of ethnically disaggregated data, including data on the Roma minority 91 . At the EU level, with the exception of three surveys that have been implemented (or will be) as a result of the EU Framework 92 , there has been a general reluctance for collection of ethnically disaggregated data which stems from the Member State Level. The Labour Force Survey, the European Statistics of Income and Living Condition (SILC 93 ), and the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) surveys do not include Roma ethnicity as a marker 94 , despite the EU urging Member States to include questions on the Roma in order to generate ethnically disaggregated data. Survey data on Roma comes with many caveats. In addition to be covering only a few Member States, the reliability of data should be carefully considered. Sampling of Roma is traditionally difficult due to lack of reliable data on the actual demographic composition or geographic distribution from census data 95 . Capturing migrant / mobile Roma populations with an adequate sample is even more challenging. Even in Member States, where Roma constitute significant part of the population \u2013 sampling is a challenge, as similarly to census data collection, Roma tend to declare in social surveys a different ethnicity \u2013 either that of the majority population or of other minority groups. The survey language may also be an issue, as the variety of Roma languages or dialects makes it difficult to conduct a single surveys in \u2018Romani\u2019 \u2013 therefore surveys are all typically in the national language, which may limit the responses from Roma who face more exclusion due to inadequate language skills. Phone surveys (CATI) may also lead to under-representation of the poorest Roma that do not have access to a phone. As a result the scale of certain problems may be overestimated or underestimated 91 European Commission , \u201cCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Community Instruments and Policies for Roma Inclusion\u201d, SEC(2008) 2172, p. 3, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52008DC0420. 92 These are the Roma pilot survey (FRA, 2011); 2016 EU-MIDIS II: European Union minorities and discrimination survey (FRA, 2016); and a third survey planned for 2020. 93 Known exception on the national level for SILC are BG and HU, which collect ethnically disaggregated statistics in their national rounds of SILC. 94 Ibid. 95 During national census, typically more than a third of Roma across the EU do not declare their ethnicity.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 36 (depending on the issue 96 ). The challenges with sampling outlined above mean that even if observed changes between 2011 and 2016 are statistically valid, one cannot draw definite conclusions. Therefore, typically where there have been two or three percentage point changes between the two periods, these have been considered as insufficiently robust evidence for change. Another issue, is the difference in the samples between the 2011 and 2016 surveys, in respect to regional coverage and urban / rural coverage. To compensate for these variations, the 2011 has been weighted to reflect these changes, when presenting comparison of the data in FRA / Commission publications. 97 An important limitation of 2011 and 2016 FRA surveys is the lack of comparability with official government statistics or Eurostat data on the majority population. Only one of them collected data on non-Roma, but not on the general population, but non-Roma living nearby. From a sociological point of view this approach is correct, as it allows to more adequately compare gaps by accounting for regional or local social and economic disparities. For the purpose of the evaluation of the NRIS and the EU Framework, the comparison with the non-Roma general population needed to use other data, such as Eurostat. The General Population data from Eurostat (and OECD) quoted throughout the report, though, includes the Roma as well. The 2011 and 2016 FRA surveys covered 9 countries, and \u2018EU level\u2019 conclusions based on this data, used a weighted average for respondents in the 9 countries covered (BG, CZ, HR, HU, ES, EL, PT, RO, SK). Similarly, Eurostat data quoted also uses the weighted average for these 9 countries 98 . The lack of ethnically disaggregated government data leaves the following issues without a clear answer for most of the EU Member States 99 : - Baseline situation of the level of discrimination and social exclusion; - Number of Roma beneficiaries reached through policy measures, especially mainstream measures; - Funds allocated to measures for Roma inclusion. The specific limitations on the funding data are discussed in detail in Section 3.5.1; - Effects of policy measures on the levels of social inclusion. The conclusion, wherever quoting average numbers from the EU-MIDIS survey, therefore only refers to the 9 Member States included in the survey 100 . Nevertheless, the Member States included in the surveys include approximately between 80% and 85% of EU\u2019s Roma population \u2013 therefore it could be claimed that to a certain extent the conclusions have some validity for the majority of EU\u2019s Roma population 101 . One of the serious limitations encountered was the availability of financial data, which is partially linked to the limitations in government statistics. One of the key data sources 96 For instance, some more \u2018integrated\u2019 Roma or others aspiring upward social mobility, may self-identify with the ethnicity of majority population. In other cases, respondents who are more sensitive to discrimination or have experienced more discrimination may also identify as the majority population to avoid stigmatisation. 97 European Commission (2017), SWD(2017) 286 final Midterm review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies, Roma integration indicators scoreboard (2011-2016) accompanying the document, p.2 98 The weighted average is not based on the actual full dataset, but on the Member State averages provided in the Eurostat database. 99 Not including BG, CZ, EL, ES, FR, HU, IT, PL, PT, RO, SK, for which data was obtained through the Roma pilot survey (FRA, 2011). 100 BG, CZ, EL, ES, HR, HU, PT, RO, SK. 101 Hypothetically it is possible that the situation of the Roma in Member States that are not included in the survey (which is around 15%) may have improved or worsened to an extent that makes the overall conclusions invalid.

The following limitations were identified with this information: \uf0b7 The 2015 / 2016 data is only partially comparable to the data in prior years, as the latter is not structured, and was reported in a questionnaire format. \uf0b7 There are gaps in the data, as some Member States have not provided financial information for 2015, but only for 2016. \uf0b7 Mainstream measures, where the majority of funding falls, generally include no estimate of the number of Roma beneficiaries. \uf0b7 There are limitations as to how Member States report on the costs (e.g. do they include \u2018implementation\u2019 or \u2018management\u2019 costs of policy measures; are all costs quantified \u2013 often policy measures that have long-term financial impact are immediately quantified \u2013 e.g. an educational measure that may require more teachers or more schools at some future point may not be quantified at the time of adoption). The EU funding data also faced similar limitations, as only measures specifically targeting Roma allowed for accounting the number of Roma participants that participated. \u2018Roma\u2019 specific indicators in ESIF in the 2007-2013 period only existed in several Member States national operating programmes, but not as an EU-level indicator. Similarly, in the 2014-2020 period, ERDF also neither had a specific priority on Roma, and only some Member States had operating programme indicators. ESF (2014-2020), on the other hand, was an exception its Investment Priority 9ii, which covered 12 Member States, allowed for Roma specific information to be assessed. These limitations are discussed in detail in the Efficiency section of the report. A 2015 Thematic evaluation on IPA support to Roma communities during 2007-2013 identified both targeted and mainstream Roma integration projects. This allowed for Roma specific information to be assessed in the enlargement region.

At the EU level, the European Commission setup coordination and consultation structures and mechanisms, mobilised funding, and undertook activities to monitor the implementation of the objectives of the EU Framework. Adoption of NRIS Seventeen Member States 103 have adopted NRIS strategies, the remaining ten Member States 104 have adopted sets of policy documents \u2013 these were largely adopted in 2011 and 2012, with the active participation of the Roma stakeholders. The analysis of strategic documents and interviews with NRCPs show that Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Finland have aligned the objectives of their NRIS to the four main Roma integration goals in the areas of health, education, employment, and housing. Belgium and Croatia have partially aligned their NRIS only in respect to education and employment. The remaining Member States either have not aligned their objectives at all, or have aligned only one objective. All 6 Western Balkan enlargement countries 105 have adopted NRIS strategies in connection with the Roma Decade, which are updated as a direct result of the EU Framework. By 2016 all 7 enlargement countries had NRIS strategies and Action Plans. Fourteen Member States 106 included additional priority areas different from the ones provided by the EU Framework. The additional priority areas are the following: Media, Crime, Political engagement, Rule of Law, and Culture. For the enlargement region 107 , the additional priority of access to civil documentation was added. The Member States in which Roma constitute a large share of the general population (RO, BG, SK, HU) have closely aligned their NRIS with the EU Framework, and generally various policy measures were implemented. These aspects are fully explored in the Effectiveness section 3.4.2 and 3.4.3. The policy documents for some Member States are little more than descriptions of existing policies with respect to minorities or analyses of the situation of the Roma. Some lack objectives, and consequently the implementation of the EU Framework in these Member States is difficult to assess. In their reporting and in the course of the Stakeholder consultations, such Member States declared that they approach the issue of Roma inclusion through a mainstream approach, as part of general efforts to improve the situation of socially excluded groups (FR, DE, LU, NL, UK, DK). Implementation EU institutions have to a certain extent aligned EU funding and ensured consideration of the EU Framework by other mainstreaming policies. Most importantly, the European Structural and Investment Funds, ESIF, as well as directly managed EU funds (REC, Progress, Erasmus, or Horizon 2020), were steered towards assuring more funding for 103 BE, BG, CZ, IE, EL, ES, FR, HR, IT, HU, PL, PT, RO, SI, SK, FI, SE 104 DK, DE, EE, CY, LV, LT, LU, NL, AT, UK 105 AL, BiH, ME, RS, Kosovo and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 106 NL, BG, DK, El, ES, FR, IE, HR, IT, LT, SK, FI, SE, UK 107 AL, BiH, ME, RS, TR, Kosovo and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ",

IPA II funds have are also been ensured to support Roma inclusion in the enlargement region. The funding was also used as a stimulus for Member States to put an NRIS in place, by introducing an ex-ante conditionality for ESIF funding in the 2014-2020 programming period (See Coherence section 3.3.1.2). The EU also used the European Semester process as a \u2018force for change\u2019: five Member States Member States were given Country Specific Recommendations to implement inclusive reform of mainstream measures in the areas of education (in particular structural reform to promote Roma participation in quality, inclusive mainstream education) and employment (BG, CZ, RO, HU, SK,) (See Coherence 3.3.1.3) Systematic funding data was available only for 2015 and 2016. The value of actual spending reported by Member States for this period was EUR 41 million for EU funds and EUR 311 million for national funds. The majority (93%) of national spending was on education measures. Additional funds have been allocated or already spent on Roma in enlargement countries through the IPA programme. These costs are estimated to have already reaped some benefits (see Efficiency section on benefits) in terms of long-term economic benefits due to the improved educational attainment, and could potentially bring further economic benefits from reducing the gap in unemployment between Roma and non-Roma (with a time delay). The situation of the Roma The situation of Roma in the European Union and enlargement countries still remains dire, as poverty, discrimination, and manifestations of anti-Gypsyism (such as harassment) continue to be major issues that affect them disproportionately. Discrimination with respect to accessing housing and employment levels remain particularly high (Effectiveness section 3.4.1). The 2016 FRA EUMIDIS II survey data 108 and country studies provide the following picture: Roma enrolment rates in compulsory education in most Member States, for which data is available, reached similar levels as the rest of the populations, though with a significant gap remaining in Greece and Romania. With respect to early leavers from secondary or vocational training education, the gap between Roma and non-Roma has shrunk from 74 to 57 percentage points, but with an average of 68% drop-out rates for Roma much progress is still needed 109 . The self-reported health situation of the Roma has also improved, but data on gap in life-expectancy between Roma and non-Roma suggests that there is still a significant gap 110 . The health coverage gap with the majority of the population remained significant. Member States largely relied on a mainstream approach, while good practices such as health mediators were implemented in few Member States (HU, BG). With respect to employment , the gap between Roma and non-Roma is significant, including the gap in youth NEETs. The employment rates of Roma are about 40 percentage points in most Member States, while Roma NEET on average increased from 56% to 63% between 2011 and 2016 111 . Despite mainstream and targeted active labour market policies, the EU-wide rise in unemployment (2012-14) contributed to the lack of progress in this area.

The gap with the rest of the population in terms of access to electricity has been insignificant (96% of Roma have access to electricity) 112 . There has been a lack of major policy initiatives in Member States that could have contributed to shifting the housing conditions of the Roma. With respect to overall poverty rates, despite a slight drop from 86% to 80% regarding Roma at risk of poverty, the gap with EU general population remains significant \u2013 56.5 percentage points. 113 Coordination Structures At EU level, a team in charge of coordinating Roma integration was set up within the non-discrimination unit of DG JUST. The European Platform for Roma Inclusion engaging stakeholders from Member State governments, civil society, international organisation, European institutions, and local authorities was further developed, and has been regularly convening to discuss policy development or exchange experience. Within the European Commission Directorate General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement negotiations (DG NEAR), an Advisor in charge of the coordination of Roma policy was appointed. She coordinated the establishment of a network of Roma contact points, including in the EU Delegations and the EU Office in the enlargement region, with the objective to mirror the activities of the Member States on Roma integration. The Advisor also leads, in collaboration with international organisations, a number of projects aimed at collecting and updating evidence on Roma inclusion and returnees to Western Balkans, including Roma. This evidence is used as basis for the accession negotiations on Roma integration in the enlargement countries. At Member State level, National Roma Contact Points (NRCPs) were established in 28 Member States. These were largely newly appointed individuals or units \u2013 even though some partially already existed. Enlargement NRCPs have also been appointed by all 7 enlargement governments \u2013 some of these appointments were initially made during the Roma Decade. Mechanisms such as National Roma Platforms were developed to engage Roma stakeholders in the process of monitoring and implementation of the NRIS (see Coordination 3.5.2). National coordination mechanisms for the implementation of NRIS were also established in some Member States. Since 2011, DG NEAR holds bi-annual Roma Seminars with the 6 Western Balkan governments, and National Dialogue Forums (the equivalent of National Roma Platforms) have been set up in all 7 enlargement countries. 112 Roma Integration Indicators Scoreboard / FRA (2018) Op.cit. 113 FRA (2011, 2016)/Eurostat ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 42 3.2 Relevance Key findings The general objective of the EU Framework is to promote the equal treatment of Roma and their social and economic integration in the European society. It also establishes specific Roma integration goals around access of Roma to education, employment, healthcare and housing. The Roma integration goals were found to be relevant given the substantial gaps evidenced between the Roma and non-Roma populations when the EU Framework was introduced in 2011. The Roma integration goals have broadly remained relevant also at the endpoint of the evaluation in 2017. Some trends, such as increased discrimination faced by Roma and increased anti-Gypsyism and hate crimes, suggest that the relevance of the EU Framework has even increased between the time the EU Framework was adopted and the current period. However, some factors have limited the relevance of the EU Framework, such as the lack of ambition of some targets (e.g. in the education area) and the initial omission of the fight against anti-Gypsyism from the objectives (which the 2013 Council Recommendation introduced as part of a further focus on discrimination \u2013 see section 1.2/table 1). Also, while the EU Framework provides flexibility for the adaptation of the objectives of the EU Framework to specific national contexts and to changes over time, this flexibility also implies that the relevance of the EU Framework hinges closely on the appropriateness of the specific objectives set forth in the NRISs in relation to the needs of the target Roma population. The relevance of the EU Framework and the 2013 Council Recommendation could be strengthened by adopting a stronger anti-discrimination and anti-Gypsyism dimension. In addition, the relevance of the objectives of the EU Framework could also be enhanced by promoting the interlinkages and complementarities between the four priority areas and recognise the specific needs associated with multiple and intersectional discrimination. Lastly, emerging needs suggest defining further integration goals and specific objectives for the future. For example, the Roma integration goal for healthcare could be broadened to include not only access, but also utilisation and quality of healthcare. The educational goals could be more ambitious to ensure that all Roma children not only complete compulsory education, but also ECEC and higher levels of education (secondary and tertiary) in order to mitigate gaps with respect to the non- Roma population. The assessment of \u2018relevance\u2019 considers the extent to which the EU Framework\u2019s original objectives including the Roma Integration Goals were appropriate in view of the original and current needs of the Roma. The analysis of this criterion is supported by two evaluation questions and five sub-evaluation questions. 3.2.1 To what extent have the (original) objectives proven to be appropriate in view of the needs? This first question addresses the relevance of the initial objectives of the EU Framework (the Roma Integration Goals) in relation to the needs at the time of its adoption (2011) and in view of the current levels of discrimination and disadvantages faced by the Roma (respectively, Sections 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2). The 2013 Council Recommendation is mentioned and discussed when relevant. Surveys conducted by FRA provide statistics on the original needs in 2011 and the newly emerging needs in 2016. The original needs of the Roma is related to the baseline, which is reviewed in Section 1.3. The criterion also reviews the possible need to update the EU Roma Framework (Section 3.2.1.3) and check its relevance for the future (Section 3.2.2). ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 43 3.2.1.1 To what extent were the original objectives of the EU Framework appropriate in view of the original needs? This question addresses the relevance of the EU Framework at the time of its adoption in 2011. The original objectives of the EU Framework are the Roma Integration Goals for each of the four priority areas : Education, Health, Employment and Housing. An assessment of the original needs of the Roma in relation to each of the goals is presented in Section 1.3 (Baseline). The findings confirm that the Roma suffered a disadvantaged position as compared with non-Roma in each of the four policy areas at the time of the adoption of the EU Framework. These gaps were sizeable and evident in the EU Member States as well as the enlargement countries. The Roma Integration Goals were considered to be appropriate at the time of the adoption of the EU Roma Framework as they sought to reduce the identified gaps between Roma and non-Roma. However, some sources reviewed during the evaluation suggest that the goals may have been better aligned to the needs of the Roma at that time, which would have resulted in increased relevance. Specifically, some sources of evidence suggest that the objectives within each area were set too low and the goals themselves were defined too narrowly. Other sources suggest that the goals may not have provided sufficient guidance to facilitate adapting the goals to country-specific contexts and Roma sub-groups. Each of these highlighted issues is reviewed below. The baseline analysis presented in Section 1.3 highlights the heterogeneous situation of the Roma across countries as well as provides indications of differences between sub- groups within the Roma population. The relevance of the EU Framework thus hinged closely on the extent to which Member States made use of the flexibility offered by the framework to adapt the specific objectives of the Roma Integration Goals to the national context including the specific needs of the Roma population. For example, access to healthcare as such might not be an issue in countries where universal healthcare is provided; in these countries, discrimination by healthcare personnel, communication or health literacy issues should be given priority. Similarly, the housing needs vary across countries: while in some countries Roma lack access to basic infrastructure, in other countries problems are mainly related to discrimination rather than to housing conditions. Therefore, the objectives and specific objectives established by the NRISs is a reflection of the relevance of the EU Framework and the Roma Integration Goals. The sub-sections below present specific findings by priority area. Education Whilst the relevance of reaching universal primary education cannot be questioned, including this objective in the Framework lacked real ambition. According to the best available evidence, the average rate of primary school completion in the EU was 98% already back in 2009 114 . In 2013, this was partially corrected, by setting a more ambitious goal for all Roma children to complete compulsory education. This goal corresponded closer to the Roma needs, as in 2011, the gap between Roma and non- Roma compulsory education enrolment rates were almost 12% 115 . A much more pronounced need for Roma students was the transition from primary to secondary education, and lower secondary to upper secondary education, where the gap was over 60 percentage points in all of the 9 Member States covered by the 2011 FRA Roma Survey 116 . 114 EU Labour Force Survey 2009. http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/EU_labour_force_survey_-_ad_hoc_modules 115 COM (2017) 458 final Roma integration indicators scoreboard (2011-2016). 116 FRA (2018), A persisting concern: anti-Gypsyism as a barrier to Roma inclusion, p.29 ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 44 The EU Framework also called on Member States to support the Roma Integration Goal by improving access to education through the following specific measures: \uf09f Widen Roma children\u2019s\u2019 access to quality ECEC and care; \uf09f Support Roma pupils' primary school completion; \uf09f Prevent discrimination and/or segregation to/or Roma children; \uf09f Reduce Roma pupils\u2019 dropout rates; \uf09f Encourage Roma youngsters to participate in secondary and tertiary education; and \uf09f Improve the intercultural competences of teachers. These measures were overall relevant to the needs at the time of the adoption of the EU Framework. Education was and remains key to address a broader set of obstacles to social inclusion faced by Roma people across Europe 117 . While there is a general appreciation of the Framework covering areas related to education that are common to all EU countries 118 , stakeholders also admit that it provides sufficient flexibility for each Member State to set additional priorities 119 . The majority of the interviewees at national level indicate that the education objectives were relevant to a great extent. In particular, the importance of ECEC and care (ECEC) was highlighted 120 , along with the emphasis on fighting segregated educational practices 121 . Health The Roma Integration Goal seeks to reduce the gap in health status between the Roma and the rest of the population by promoting Roma access to quality (mainstream) healthcare. The Framework calls on Member States to (specific measures): \uf09f Provide access to quality healthcare for children and women; \uf09f Ensure equal access to preventive care and social services for Roma/non-Roma; and \uf09f Involve qualified Roma in healthcare programmes targeting their communities. As confirmed by interviews, the Roma Integration Goal was appropriate in view of the overall health gap between Roma and non-Roma in terms of life expectancy, infant mortality, vaccination coverage, etc. This gap points to a limited access to or use of healthcare services, although 78% of the Roma population was covered by medical insurance 122 . In this context, the original objectives defined at EU level, as later reinforced by the Council Recommendation, are considered overall relevant. However, the promotion of gender equality and anti-discrimination in reference to health are additional needs not fully or explicitly addressed by the objectives of the EU Framework. As noted in the literature , Roma women were more likely to report a very poor health status, as 117 These include: literature review, Open Public Consultation, key stakeholder interviews at national level, 118 FR2, IE4, NL1, AT2, BG6. 119 AT2. 120 ES1. 121 BG8. 122 See Section 1.3 Baseline.

In addition, discrimination by healthcare personnel was widespread against Roma in 2011 125 . Employment The Roma Integration Goal seeks to reduce the employment gap between Roma and the general population. The Framework calls on Member States to (specific measures): \uf0b7 Grant access to vocational training, to the job market and to self-employment tools and initiatives in a non-discriminatory way; \uf0b7 Encourage access to micro-credit; \uf0b7 Give due attention to qualified Roma civil servants in the public sector; and \uf0b7 Ensure that Public Employment Services reach out the Roma and provide personalised services and mediation. This Roma Integration Goal was relevant and appropriate in view of the original needs in the time of the adoption of EU Framework for NRIS by all Member States. As commonly stated by representatives of both public authorities and NGOs in the interviews, NGO survey and OPC respondents, in 2011 vocational training was considered as the most relevant employment measure for Roma inclusion 126 , while many respondents highlighted the importance of supporting first work experiences, lifelong learning and basic skills development and combating discrimination and prejudices 127 .However, these challenges were addressed by the 2013 Council Recommendation, which, as a way forward to achieving employment objectives, called Member States to take the following specific measures: - supporting first work experience, vocational training, on-the-job training, lifelong learning and skills development; - supporting self-employment and entrepreneurship; - providing equal access to mainstream public employment services, alongside services to support individual job-seekers, focusing on personalised guidance and individual action planning and, where appropriate, promoting employment opportunities within the civil service; - eliminating barriers, including discrimination, to (re)entering the labour market. The EU Framework for NRIS adopted in 2011 was also relevant in addressing Roma employment needs, putting Roma employment on the political agenda and boosting monitoring and cooperation. As stated in several country analysis studies, backed up by interviews in many Member States and enlargement countries, Roma employment issues would have been left out of the political debate without the EU Framework. Overall, the employment objectives were characterised as relevant. Additional needs identified and considered to be relevant but not addressed, included improving Roma equal access to mainstream public employment services, supporting self-employment and entrepreneurship as well as facilitating a better transition from school to work and improving Roma access to the open labour market 128 .

Housing The Roma Integration Goal to close the housing and essential services gap between Roma and the rest of the population represents a key factor to enhancing the integration of Roma into society. The specific measures Member States should take are: \uf09f Promotion of non-discriminatory access to housing, including social housing; \uf09f Action on housing needs to be part of an integrated approach including, in particular, education, health, social affairs, employment and security, and desegregation measures; \uf09f Address the particular needs of non-sedentary Roma (e.g. provide access to suitable halting sites for non-sedentary Roma); and \uf09f Actively intervene with targeted programmes involving regional and local authorities. The EU Framework aims at promoting non-discriminatory access of Roma to housing and to public utilities, including water, gas and electricity 130 . For non-sedentary Roma, the EU Framework emphasises the need to address non-discriminatory access to suitable halting sites, which should have access to water. The original objectives as set out by the EU Framework in the area of housing were appropriate in view of the original housing needs of the Roma minority in Europe. The literature review as well as data collected prior to 2011 revealed that Roma, compared to other population groups, faced poorer housing conditions as well as discrimination and segregation across the Member States as well as in the enlargement countries (see Baseline Section 1.3 for more information). While confirming the appropriateness of the original objectives of the EU Framework in view of the original needs, consulted civil society stakeholders 131 expressed regret over the absence of tailored housing objectives across the Member States to address particular country needs in the current context. The 2011 FRA Roma Survey and the data collected for the country analysis reports indicate that the housing situation of Roma in relation to deprived living conditions, lack of basic infrastructure and segregation, was worst in Eastern-European countries \u2013 particularly so in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia \u2013 in 2011, whereas Roma in countries such as Austria and Finland faced problems mainly in relation to access housing due to discrimination, rather than in relation to housing conditions or housing segregation 132 . 3.2.1.2 How well do the original objectives still correspond to the current needs? How relevant is the EU Framework considering the current levels of discrimination and disadvantages faced by Roma? This question addresses the relevance of the EU Framework to the current needs of the Roma. The analysis by thematic area (see sections below) for the most part reveals substantial gaps between Roma and non-Roma in 2016. In some cases, gaps have 129 CS-AT and European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Rights Annual Report 2017, chapter 4 Roma Integration. 130 European Commission, \u2018Communication on an EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020\u2019, COM (2011) 0173 final, p. 7. 131 Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, ERGO Network and ENAR 132 CS-AT; CS-FI; CS-HU; CS-RO; CS-SK.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 47 narrowed substantially since the baseline, for example, the share of the Roma population reported to be in \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018good health\u2019. However, other gaps remain, such as the share of the population with medical insurance coverage. Thus, the Roma Integration Goals are considered to remain relevant for the Roma population. The evaluation identified three trends between the time the EU Framework was adopted and the current period that suggest that the relevance of the EU Framework has increased: \uf09f First, discrimination faced by Roma has remained a prominent issue between 2011 and 2016 and appears to be the key factor that hinders ultimate progress in the four policy areas. In 2016, 40% of Roma felt discriminated against when looking for a job (down by only 10% since 2011), and 41% when looking for housing 133 (down by only 4% since 2011) 134 . Segregation, lack of protection from bullying and discrimination in the area of education 135 , as well as discrimination in healthcare 136 , remain equally important issues. More on discrimination can be found in Section 3.4.1 (Effectiveness) and Section 3.9.1 (Equity). \uf09f Second, sources suggest that Anti-Gypsyism and hate crimes have also increased in many Member States , a trend that can be partly attributed to increased radicalization and extremism in the EU 137 . In the 2011 FRA survey, 33% of Roma experienced some form of victimisation. In 2016, the situation worsened. EU-MIDIS II suggests that racially motivated crimes were encountered by more than half of Roma (52%) reported experiencing a physical attack in the past 12 months due to their ethnic background 138 (on anti-Gypsyism, see Section 3.9.1 on Equity and Section 3.3.2.2 on Coherence). \uf09f Lastly, the prevalence and composition of the Roma in the Member States changed since the baseline. A primary driver was the movement of Roma to the EU-15 Member States . These movements were related to 2014 lifting of former restrictions on the free movement of workers from Bulgaria and Romania, which, although not specific to Roma, also affected them 139 . Since that date, a considerable number of citizens from these countries moved to EU-15 Member States, such as Italy, the Netherlands or the UK 140 . 133 EU-MIDIS II survey and Roma Integration Indicators Scoreboard 2011-2016. 134 2011 numbers taken from the Baseline of this report - Section 1.5. 135 NGO workshop participant mentioned the lack of protection. 136 EU-MIDIS II. 137 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Assessing the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the Council Recommendation on Effective Roma Integration Measures\u2019, COM (2016) 424 138 Data explorer for the FRA EU-MIDIS II, available at : http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and- resources/data-and-maps/survey-data-explorer-second-eu-minorities-discrimination-survey 139 Open Migration, 2015, From Morocco to Romania: how immigration to Italy has changed over 10 years, http://openmigration.org/en/analyses/from-morocco-to-romania-marocco-how-immigration-to-italy- changed-in-10-years/ ; CBS, 2017, More Eastern Europeans working in the Netherlands, https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2017/05/more-eastern-europeans-working-in-the-netherlands ; The Guardian, 2017, Number of Romanians and Bulgarians in UK rises to 413,000, https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/number-of-romanians-and-bulgarians-in-uk-rises- 413000 140 http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=14000&langId=en.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 48 The analysis of the relevance of the original objectives for the original needs of the Roma (see previous question, Section 3.2.1.1) suggests that the relevance of the EU Framework hinges closely on the definition of the specific objectives in the NRISs . A survey of national NGOs conducted as part of the evaluation suggests that the objectives of the NRISs have been and remain largely relevant to the current needs 141 . The EU Framework seeks to meet the needs of those Roma who are socially excluded and discriminated against. However, some sources 142 suggest that, since its adoption, the Framework has given more attention to some sub-groups within the Roma population over others. For example, the framework addresses issues linked to access to education for children and access to healthcare for both children and women 143 . However, other subgroups like elderly, disabled or LGBTI Roma, or migrant Roma from third countries, are not mentioned. \uf09f Education: difficulty in promoting effective transition for Roma to upper secondary and tertiary education; \uf09f Employment: needs of NEETs, language and skills\u2019 development; \uf09f Health: medical insurance coverage and specific health problems that affect Roma (communicable and chronic diseases due to poor living and housing conditions); \uf09f Housing: EU-mobile Roma, Roma from third countries and Roma with a semi- nomad lifestyle; housing segregation and forced evictions. The relevance of these and the overall Roma Integration Goals by priority area is reviewed below. Education For some Member States (Greece, Romania) the goal for all Roma children to complete compulsory education, remains very much relevant. For other Member States (BG, CZ, ES, HU, SK) where there are either no gaps or it is within statistical margin of error, this is no longer an ambitious goal. Improving transition from lower-secondary to upper- secondary education, and reducing drop-out rates in secondary education are more adequate needs 144 . Specific objectives of the Framework remain largely relevant. Despite a significant, 19% decrease in early school leaving rates among Roma between 2011 and 2016, indicators remained alarmingly high (with rates up to 24 times higher than in overall population 145 ), segregation has even grown (See Effectiveness section 3.4.1-3.4.2) https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/number-of-romanians-and-bulgarians-in-uk-rises- 413000 141 The share of respondents perceiving the objectives of the NRISs as relevant accounted for 60% (strongly \u2013 20% or partially \u2013 40%) whilst 20% disagreed (partially \u2013 14% or strongly \u2013 6%). 142 EU-I6; European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Assessing the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the Council Recommendation on Effective Roma Integration Measures\u2019, COM (2016) 424, p. 9 and 17, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/roma-report-2016_en.pdf; Open Society European Policy Institute, Report.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 49 In the enlargement countries 146 , current needs (2017) have slightly shifted since the EU Framework\u2019s founding in 2011. For example, stakeholders in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia reveal a slight improvement in access to education (mostly due to a change in coverage) and in narrowing the gap between marginalised Roma and non-Roma pupils (change in inequality) in this area. Montenegro showed no changes and in Albania there was a greater improvement in access to education compared to other enlargement countries surveyed. Health While some improvements in the needs of the Roma were noted, the analysis finds that the Roma Integration Goal in the area of health remains valid. The gap between Roma and non-Roma largely disappeared for self-reported health status while it remained largely unchanged for medical insurance coverage since the baseline (see Section 1.3, Section 3.4.1.4). In Member States such as Bulgaria and Romania, nearly half of the Roma population was without basic medical insurance coverage in both reference years 147 . More importantly, actual (not self-perceived) health status of Roma remains unknown, but EU wide studies show \u2018indirect evidence\u2019, such as shorter life-expectancy than majority population that clearly indicate a health disparity. 148 The Roma population is disproportionally affected by communicable diseases compared to non-Roma, according to the 2014 Commission Roma Health Report 149 . Persistent poor living conditions often result in higher probability of facing serious illnesses and chronic diseases , even when access to healthcare is provided 150 . Substandard Roma housing conditions are also likely to result in exposure to poisoning and domestic accidents , especially for women and children 151 . Also on preventive healthcare, little progress has been made, as Roma continue to have consistently lower child vaccination rates compared to non-Roma 152 . Employment In terms of employment the original objectives still correspond to the current needs, as the employment gap between the Roma and the general population remains very high (see Section 3.4.1.3). A substantial gap remains in the proportion of Roma who are in paid work \u2013 including self-employment and occasional work \u2013 as compared with the non-Roma. In particular, the needs of Roma women and youth remain significant in this area with regards to labour market participation in most Member States and enlargement countries. Nearly half of the respondents to the NGO Survey considered that neither the needs of Roma youth nor of Roma women were addressed as part of the key employment measures and programmes 153 . The gender gap stills remains significant , while the share of young Roma NEETs , aged 16-24 has increased from 56% to 63%, again with a significant gender gap with 72% of young Roma girls and women in a NEET situation, as compared to 55% of young 146 Regional overview at First Glance of 2017 UNDP/WB/EC survey 147 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Midterm review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final, p. 10. 148 European Commission (2014) Roma Health Report, http://eige.europa.eu/resources/2014_roma_health_report_en.pdf 149 Ibid. 150 CS-EL and CS-AT. 151 CS-FR. 152 European Commission, Roma Health Report \u2013 Health status of the Roma population.

In some countries the gender gap of Roma NEET is notable higher (HR, EL, ES, BG) and has slightly increased from 2011 to 2016. Even though the original objectives are still relevant with the current needs, information gathered though interviews and country analysis studies reveal that there is an increasing diversity of Roma situations and trends between countries and within countries that should be considered. As for housing, the demands and needs of migrant Roma, both EU-mobile and third country nationals, are different from those of Roma groups who live for more than a generation in the same location of a country. Lifelong learning, skills development and vocational training objectives are considered as extremely relevant in all the Member States and enlargement countries 154 . Supporting the Public Employment Services (PES) to reach out to the Roma by providing personalised services and mediation has been characterised by many respondents as relevant but in most of the countries this has been integrated into mainstream employment measures which makes it impossible to examine how well current approaches still correspond to the current needs 155 . The objective to provide equal access to mainstream public employment services (PES) has been assessed as equally relevant, although the extent to which this is accessible to Roma people in many countries is not known due to the lack of related indicators. Basic language and basic skills/competence training, in particular for migrant and mobile adults Roma, is needed as part of lifelong learning and vocational training (e.g. maths, English). Language and skills development are considered as a first important step toward professional integration but they are not specifically set out in the EU Framework objectives 156 . At the same time, promoting access to microcredit seems irrelevant too as the 71% of the OPC respondents identified that the share of unemployed Roma using microcredit and entrepreneurship initiatives has not increased since 2011. Moreover, as already mentioned, the low educational level and the lack of basic skills along with discrimination hinder Roma to make use of entrepreneurship and microcredit opportunities, while migrant Roma are often unfamiliar with the national language, the legal and administrative procedures and the labour market 157 . Housing In the area of housing, the evaluation found that Roma Integration Goal continues to be relevant to the needs of the Roma, as shown in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.3. of the present report. Workshop Discussions, literature review , Country Analysis Reports , targeted stakeholder consultation , OPC \u2013 confirm that the housing situation and needs of Roma across the EU have not changed much since 2011. EU-mobile Roma and Roma from third countries face more difficulties than other Roma when accessing services, while service provision for Roma with a (semi-)nomad lifestyle poses additional challenges 158 . Only a few country analysis reports specifically refer to the situation of migrant Roma : whereas newly arrived Roma face difficulties in Austria to access social housing because they fail to fulfil the residency criterion 159 , the migrant Roma in France often face very precarious housing conditions and live on mostly illegally occupied land 160 . A 2015 evaluation on IPA support to Roma communities expresses concern about gender considerations in the housing area in enlargement 154 AT1, CS-BE, CS-IT, CS-RO, CS-FI, CS-HU 155 CS-AT, CS-IT, CS-EL. 156 CS-RO, BE05, CS-IT, CS- BG. 157 CS-AT, CS-IT, CS-FR. 158 Workshop Discussion, Brussels, March 2018 159 CS-AT. 160 CS-FR.

About half of the Country Analysis Reports and several stakeholders consulted in the Member States and enlargement countries identify housing as one of the most important areas where more work needs to be done 162 . The OPC confirms the lack of progress between 2011 and 2016, with more than half of the respondents indicating the housing situation has worsened due to higher levels of housing discrimination (57.3% of respondents) and an increase in the number of forced evictions (53% of respondents). In France , the frequent and often violent evictions mainly target migrant Roma, without alternative housing options being provided 163 . The literature review confirms the continuation of forced evictions among Roma across many Member States and some enlargement countries 164 . Almost 40% of the OPC respondents stated that additional efforts \u2013 including through increasing human capacities, policy discussions and funds \u2013 are needed at EU level to promote Roma\u2019s access to housing and essential services. Finally, according to the literature review and several consulted stakeholders at different levels , housing segregation remains one of the biggest challenges across many Member States 165 and in some enlargement countries. 3.2.1.3 Do the objectives need to be updated, when and how? The analysis finds several areas in which, given latest development specified above, the objectives of the EU Framework could be updated in order to enhance its present relevance . First, in terms of the general objectives, the EU Framework could be explicitly updated to recognise anti-Gypsyism as a key issue among Roma 166 , to reflect the 2013 Council recommendations and a 2016 Commission report 167 highlighting the importance of more systematic approaches and greater political will on the part of Member States in fighting anti-Gypsyism. In this context and along these same lines, many stakeholders, such as EU-level organisations and NGOs , have called on public actors to ensure that the four priority areas have a stronger dimension of anti-discrimination and anti-Gypsyism 168 . 161 EPRD Office for Economic Policy and Regional Development, Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma communities, European Commission, 2015, available at: https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication- detail/-/publication/d2cc11f8-e10a-11e5-8a50-01aa75ed71a1/language-en. 162 CS-BG; CS-EL; CS-FI; CS-FR; CS-IT; CS-RO.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 52 The general objectives of the EU Framework could also be updated to recognise the specific needs associated with multiple and intersectional discrimination . As recognised by the European Parliament, Roma women often face multiple and intersectional discrimination on grounds of gender and ethnic origin which goes beyond what Roma men or non-Roma women face 169 . Lastly, the general objectives could be updated to identify and strengthen the complementarity between the four priority areas 170 . With regard to the Roma Integration Goals and specific measures to be taken by the countries, the sources reviewed for the evaluation highlighted several areas in which relevance could be enhanced. In the areas of housing and employment, the measures to be taken could be updated to reflect better the needs of different sub-groups of Roma in terms of gender, age and sedentary lifestyle. The Roma integration goal for education could be more ambitious as highlighted in Section 3.2.1.1. The Roma Integration Goal for health could be expanded to consider not only access to care, but the utilisation and quality of care received. More analysis for each of the priority areas is presented below. Education To tackle early-school leaving rates and to ensure secondary education participation, more provisions should be made for second-chance education, support to the continuity in education and skills development 171 . This should also include a focus on adult education and support measures to also better equip Roma and to better link education to the area of employment 172 , as mentioned in the mid-term review of the EU Framework . In addition, as reported by national key stakeholders, digital skills and other emerging skills in demand by the transforming labour market 173 should also be addressed in the new EU Framework to further encourage school attendance rates 174 . Vocational education and training remain critical issues to be addressed 175 . Linked to education, culture (and more specifically intercultural awareness) should appear more prominently in the new 2020 EU Framework, as well as in the National Strategies. In particular, teaching staff should be equipped with better knowledge on Roma history, culture, family and social structures. To accomplish this, initial and in-service training could be provided to teachers to allow them to more effectively discrimination.\u201d See ECRI (2011), On Combating Anti-Gypsyism and Discrimination against Roma, September 2011.

Educating students on anti-Gypsyism and the importance of inclusion could also be integrated into the new EU Framework 176 . Health Since universal access to health care is a core element of public policy in EU Member States, Roma should also be ensured universal access to health care across all Member States 177 . However, policies to improve Roma health literacy, further minimize discrimination against Roma and to account for Roma mobility hurdles should also be addressed in the National Strategies of Member States and enlargement countries. In addition to this, literature suggests that health objectives would need to be updated to include a much wider scope. Approach to health with regard to Roma is almost exclusively focussed on access to care , which is much too narrow and largely ignores the need for assuring the quality and appropriateness of the available care 178 . One source cites discrimination as a possible reason, stating that many Roma have access to emergency health care services but are often unable to access basic health care due to a lack of non-discriminatory and inclusive health services overall 179 . Other sources reference the lack of ID information/cards as a barrier to accessing basic and quality healthcare 180 . Many NRIS discuss topics beyond access to health, but concrete commitments to address these other issues are not clearly integrated in the respective strategies 181 . Widening the scope of health to include quality and appropriateness of care will be a great step in addressing the specific health issues that affect Roma. Feeding into the quality and appropriateness of healthcare for Roma, there are subgroups of Roma with ongoing unmet medical needs such as needs of women , children , LGBTI Roma, elderly Roma or Roma with disabilities 182 . These unmet needs may be due to a wide range of factors such as language skills, lack of trust, physical distance, etc. (see section 3.4.1.4 for more information). Two country analysis reports 183 also mention unmet psychological needs which are more difficult to diagnose. Psychological health issues are caused by continuous discrimination faced by Roma in all areas of life and other harsh conditions which cause trauma and chronic stress .

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 54 Employment The objectives of the EU Framework need to be updated with the aim to integrate a gender perspective , the NEET situation and migrant Roma employment needs in the future planning. The continuously low levels of participation of Roma and particular Roma youth and women in the labour market as well as the high levels of involvement in the informal economy, requires the development of different approaches for addressing the employment objectives for Roma inclusion. In the country analysis studies and interviews, the low educational level of the majority of Roma has been pointed out as a factor that should be considered in the future, as in some cases Roma people, mainly migrant and mobile Roma, could not attend vocational training and/or access the labour market as they lacked basic skills 184 . Consequently, the need to adapt vocational training and lifelong learning to the particular socio-economic conditions and cultural characteristics of Roma has been emphasised as a key aspect when updating the EU Framework for NRIS. This is particularly relevant in EU15 countries (Austria, France, Belgium, Greece, Italy), but it has also been highlighted in other countries (Poland, Romania) and enlargement countries. Roma women and girls are excluded from employment due to multiple factors, including early marriage, family and childcare responsibilities 185 . The provision of childcare in parallel with vocational training might be considered as Roma women and girls face additional obstacles in accessing the labour market 186 . Some mention the need to provide case management and personalised employment pathways for Roma people 187 , mostly for women and youth as a way to address the particular socio-economic characteristics which restrain their integration in the formal labour market. The gender roles in Roma culture, attitudes and behaviour and particular lifestyles should be further examined in order to design employment measures able to effectively support the equal entry of Roma women and girls into the labour market. In addition to the above, the need to update the employment objectives in terms of developing an integrated approach based on complementarity between the four main priority areas has also been pointed out as a priority by both NGO and public- sector representatives of Member States and enlargement countries. The transition from education to employment should be addressed in an integrated and interrelated way in order to better correspond to Roma needs and reduce the high youth unemployment rates. In parallel with all the above, discrimination and anti-Gypsyism in access to the labour market should be firmly tackled with a concrete set of responsive measures. Housing The fight against housing segregation and forced evictions is identified as one of the biggest challenges in many Member States as well as in some enlargement countries by the workshop participants , the European Commission 188 and in several country 184 WB9 (Bosnia and Herzegovina), EUI1, 185 CS-ES, CS-RO, 186 CS-RO, ES2, EL3. 187 SK8, AT1, CS-IT, SK6. 188 European Commission, (2010), \u201cCommunication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, The social and economic integration of the Roma\u201d, COM(2010) 133 final, p. 2, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0133.

The European Commission\u2019s 2017 mid-term review emphasises the need for measures focussing on non-discriminatory access to social housing and on fighting spatial segregation 190 . The workshop discussions and several interviewed stakeholders emphasise the need to establish specific targets considering the different housing needs of Roma with varying levels of access to (social) housing, utilities and sanitary facilities across Member States and enlargement countries 191 . Whereas the lack of access to essential services including water and electricity constitutes the biggest problem in housing for Roma in some countries, most Roma have access to essential services but face persisting discrimination and segregation in other countries. Finally, as stressed during the workshop, the EU Framework should better address the situation of different Roma groups by taking into account the differences between urban and rural Roma as well as between local and migrant Roma, including Roma from the enlargement and neighbourhood region, especially so regarding intra-EU mobility, like it already does with the situation of (semi-)nomad Roma. 3.2.2 To what extent is the EU Framework still relevant? This second evaluation question builds on the first evaluation question in order to address the continued relevance the EU Framework in terms of its goals and the balance of its social inclusion and anti-discrimination objectives (respectively, Sections 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2). Some of the key issues previously discussed such as anti-Gypsyism are elaborated in further detail. 3.2.2.1 How relevant are the goals of the EU Framework for Roma and for European societies? This question builds on Evaluation question 3.2.1.2, which reviewed the extent to which the original objectives still correspond to the current needs of the Roma, with a focus on the four priority areas. This question goes further to assess more broadly the over- arching relevance of the EU Framework, which is to promote the equal treatment of the Roma and their social and economic integration in European society. Evidence highlights the wide-ranging and extensive forms of discrimination and barriers to social inclusion faced by the Roma at the time the EU Framework was introduced and currently (see Sections 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2). This discrimination carries high economic and social costs for both the affected population and the overall society that include foregone GDP for Member States 192 . Thus, the goals of the EU Framework are and remain highly relevant for Roma and European societies. 189 CS-AT; CS-SK.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 56 However, considering the implementation of the EU Framework since 2011, evidence 193 suggests that more political commitment, decision-making power, and more refined and practicable goals might have enhanced relevance and set forth a more coherent Framework for action at the EU and national levels. The EU Framework was defined within the context of two key instruments tackling poverty and social exclusion in the Member States: the Europe 2020 Strategy and Directive 2000/43/EC, however it could have gone further through the provision of practical examples and best practices. For example, the EU Framework could have indicated how the Directive could be used by Member States to adopt positive action measures that promote Roma inclusion in the different areas. The 2013 Council Recommendation highlights positive action (see paragraph 1.1), but does not delve into the broad spectrum of different positive action measures that are available to Member States. The OSEPI 194 and other civil society organisations 195 suggest that the EU Framework could have been better integrated into core EU policies. The EU Framework and the 2013 Council Recommendation 196 which reinforced the objectives of the EU Framework, are not legislative acts, but can be understood as Roma-specific soft-law instruments. Through its coordination competence, the EU Framework establishes guiding principles across a broad range of policies. It defers to Member States in many respects to apply these guiding principles in the definition and implementation of their respective NRISs. This approach has allowed Member States and enlargement countries to follow a tailored approach that takes into account national specificities including the country\u2019s policy and institutional context and the specific needs of the Roma in the country. While such an approach has the potential to enhance the relevance of actions, the evidence 197 rather suggests that it may have contributed to limited or inconsistent actions at national level resulting in overall fragmented implementation . The evaluation also identified other related challenges that limited the relevance of the goals of the EU Framework. For example, the EU Framework presents a very broad definition of its target population \u2013 the Roma. This broad definition reflected the understanding of the Roma being a heterogeneous population that encompass a number of distinct groups of people and the significant variation in the composition of the Roma population across Member States. However, such a broad definition also led to a lack of clarity 198 in terms of the implementation of the Framework and the generation of country contributions towards its goals. Instead of defining a specific ethnic minority, 193 FRA A persisting concern: anti-Gypsyism as a barrier to Roma inclusion , 2018 mentions that MS investments did not achieve the goals set out in the EU Framework of April 2011 and that a renewed stronger political commitment is needed to fulfil the promise of the framework and to tackle anti-Gypsyism; European Commission A Synthesis Report on Implementation of National Roma Integration Strategies in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia , 2018 mentions that the reviewed NRIS did not adequately focus on developing new policies, implementing their actions and in achieving results. 194 Open Society European Policy Institute, Report.

Furthermore, in some countries, Roma are recognised as an ethnic group but targeted as a marginalised social group 200 . Or, Roma inclusion policies may not exclusively target Roma but rather vulnerable groups (which can include Roma) 201 . The EU Framework promotes a combination of targeted and mainstream measures in order to achieve its goal of reducing the gaps between Roma and other members of European society. In practice, the lack of clarity regarding the definition of the target population led to challenges for some countries to define a targeted approach 202 as well as monitoring the results of targeted and mainstream measures 203 . This issue was compounded by the fact that few countries collect ethnic data. As discussed in more detail in Section 3.5, there are significant challenges to determining the extent to which measures reach and benefit the Roma. The EU Framework and the 2013 Council Recommendation support an integrated approach. However, they could have gone further through the provision of specific examples and best practices to adequately highlight the inter-connections and complementarities between education, health, employment and housing. Rather, the evidence suggests that countries primarily took a policy area-specific approach and tackled each priority individually rather than through integrated projects or programmes that cut across several policy areas 204 . A UNDP report supports this idea by mentioning the shortage of integrated solutions that link education, employment, health and capacity building activities as one of the major policy deficits regarding Roma communities. 205 An EU interviewee 206 also noted that the Framework was particularly \u201csiloed\u201d with respect to the policy areas and should consider cross-cutting issues such as children\u2019s rights and social protection. NGO workshop participants similarly stressed that the four policy areas are currently being represented separately despite their being interrelated and interlinked. The FRA also highlights the interlinkage of the policy areas in its 2018 publication, noting that the lack of basic sanitation and poor housing conditions of Roma is not a stand-alone issue but also hampers progress in the other policy areas such as education, health and employment 207 .

All the indicators to assess progress in relation to the Roma Integration Goals are area-specific, reflecting the emphasis on a policy area-specific approach. 3.2.2.2 To what extent was the combination of social inclusion and anti- discrimination objectives sufficiently balanced to address the needs? The general objectives of the EU Framework aim to address the discrimination and social exclusion that the Roma face, and to contribute to improving their poorer access to social services and worse outcomes in the priority areas of education, health, employment and housing. Multiple sources ( OSEPI, UN-OHCHR, etc ) suggest that these two objectives were often conflated as one overall goal by stakeholders rather than as two separate objectives that should be tackled simultaneously through different types of measures. Moreover, stakeholders tended to focus on the social inclusion objectives with less attention to anti-discrimination . As explained further in Section 3.3.1.3 (Coherence), Member States were not requested to establish separate anti-discrimination measures nor define targets. More weight to the anti-discrimination objective is critical in order to address anti- Gypsyism 208 and its manifestations in terms of hate speech and crime 209 . A number of stakeholders, including the European Institutions 210211 and NGO workshop participants 212 , feel that insufficient attention has been given to the anti- discrimination objectives as well as to anti-Gypsyism at the EU and national levels. The OPC show that, in addition to noting a rise in discrimination , respondents also find that little is being done to actively fight discrimination in the four main policy areas over the course of the current EU Framework (Figure 2). 208 Centre for European Policy Studies, Research Report: Combating Institutional Anti-Gypsyism.

This is important, considering that Roma\u2019s limited participation in policy decisions, their limited institutional capacity and funding, and discrimination are among the multiple factors that cause Roma exclusion in all four policy areas 213 . While these issues have been somewhat addressed since 2011, this was done on a merely \u2018ad hoc basis\u2019 given their overall absence from the existing Framework 214 (see Section for more information about Effectiveness). The Midterm Review of the EU Framework notes that Member States have put in place legal frameworks to prohibit discrimination, but enforcement of EU legislation remains a serious challenge (see Section 3.3.1.3 on Coherence). Evidence 215 further suggests that National Equality Bodies as well as judicial systems at national level have not been sufficiently engaged and active to help balance the wider anti-discrimination objectives with Roma needs. Efforts to change this could strengthen the complementary relationships between the EU Framework and the Racial Equality Directive, the Employment Equality Directive, as well as the Council Framework Decision on combatting Racism and Xenophobia 216 . 3.3 Coherence Key findings Coherence addresses the potential for synergies between the EU Framework and other similar policies at the EU and national level, and the alignment of legal, political and financial instruments. 213 Overwhelming majority of OPC respondents. 214 UN-OHCHR, Lessons Learned: Views in the Context of Mid-Term Review of Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2012-2020, 2017, http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/Lessons%20Learnt%20EU%20Framework%20for%20Natio nal%20Roma%20Integration%20Strategies%202012%202020.pdf 215 European Commission, A Synthesis Report on Implementation of National Roma Integration Strategies in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia , 2018; also mentioned in the NGO Workshop. 216 See Section 3.3.1.3 on Coherence for more information.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 60 Overall, EU and national policies are coherent with the EU Framework and NRIS. However, the implementation of policies and measures for Roma inclusion appears to be challenging across EU Member States and enlargement countries, which results in a reduced alignment with the EU Framework in practice. In the four policy areas of education, health, employment and housing, the EU Framework has contributed to mainstreaming Roma integration into national policies to a limited extent. There has been an overall reluctance to include specific references to Roma and their specific needs into mainstream policies in order not to give more weight to one minority group over another. Roma integration is thus often dealt within wider social inclusion policies. Substantial progress has been made in linking Roma integration priorities with EU financial instruments. Nevertheless, a few shortcomings have been identified. For example, proportionally, less funding appears to be allocated to Roma integration measures in the area of anti- discrimination than to measures targeting social inclusion. In terms of EU funding, the level of coherence between NRIS and EU funding has been substantially increased following the introduction of the ex-ante conditionality to have a Roma inclusion strategic policy framework in place and the IP 9ii \u201cA national Roma inclusion strategic policy framework is in place\u201d. National funding has been allocated to further the implementation of the NRIS, complementing or in addition to, EU funding in some countries. In terms of anti-discrimination, the EU Framework is complementary to aims and scope with EU legal instruments on non-discrimination, albeit it lacks specific targets. The absence of specific measurable targets constitutes a missed opportunity to increase the coherence of policy measures to fight discrimination against Roma further with the strong EU legislation on the matter. The NRIS have influenced or led to the adoption of measures to fight discrimination, racism and hate speech in a number of countries. However, in some countries it was not possible to identify a clear contribution as relevant policy objectives and measures were absent from the NRIS. While the EU Framework is coherent with other EU policies, such as the Youth Guarantee, Skills Agenda, VET and the Alliance for Apprenticeships, some gaps have been identified. Similarly, Roma integration considerations have been included under the European Semester monitoring and Country Specific Recommendations of five countries. The assessment of coherence in this context gives mixed results in the four policy areas (i.e. education, health, employment and housing). Lastly, the EU Framework is not fully taken up in the monitoring of relevant EU legal and policy instrument. While infringement proceedings have been launched under the Racial Equality Directive, the latest monitoring of the Directive did not identify relevant points for improvements. The assessment of \u2018coherence\u2019 examines how well or not the EU Framework\u2019s original objectives work together with other EU and national actions. In particular, it attempts to identify synergies or inconsistencies between the EU Framework and other European policy, legal and funding instruments, between NRIS and other national policy, legal and funding instruments, as well as local action. The coherence is examined across the four areas (education, employment, health and housing) and the fight against discrimination. The analysis of this criterion is supported by two evaluation questions and eight sub- evaluation questions. A summary overview of coherence at EU and Member State levels is presented in Tables 10 and 11 below. Table 10.

This first evaluation question attempts to understand the extent to which the EU Framework has contributed to having EU and national policies include Roma integration considerations and targets into their policies, policy monitoring tools and funding mechanisms, and how those are coherent with the EU Framework. The below sub- questions attempt to answer this evaluation question. 3.3.1.1 To what extent did it contribute to mainstreaming Roma integration into national and EU policies? At EU level , mainstreaming Roma inclusion across EU legislation and strategies, including EU funding mechanisms is key to compensate for the lack of mandatory obligations of the current EU Framework. The EU Framework relies thus on mainstreaming of Roma inclusion agenda across EU policies in order to enforce its principles and targets 217 . Due to the nature of Roma social integration, which is driven not only by socio-economic factors but discrimination and anti-Gypsyism, there is potential for synergies between the EU Framework and the EU anti-discrimination legislation and policies. There is an increased acknowledgment that the EU Framework is particularly weak in this area 218 , 217 Open Society Institute, Report: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, 2017, https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/revisiting-eu-roma- framework-assessing-european-dimension-post-2020-future. 218 Open Society Institute, Report: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, 2017, https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/revisiting-eu-roma- framework-assessing-european-dimension-post-2020-future; UN-OHCHR, Lessons Learned: Views in the ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 62 which reduces the potential for mainstreaming in EU anti-discrimination legislation and policies (see further under sub-question 3.3.1.3, which goes into further details on the coherence between the EU Framework and the EU anti-discrimination legal framework). The Commission launching of the three infringement procedures with respect to Roma children segregation in education has been identified as a positive development and contribution of the EU Framework to mainstreaming Roma integration into EU policies and their monitoring. At the same time, housing rights violations have been regularly reported in countries such as Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, Romania and Serbia, which lacks acknowledgment at EU level and should be built into European policies going forward 219 . At national level , the eleven case studies indicated different levels of mainstreaming and contribution of the Framework to further integrate Roma integration into national policies. In some cases, the EU Framework contributed or further bolstered ongoing inclusion of Roma integration issues into policies and the adoption of specific measures. For example, in France , major policies and legislation changes have followed the EU Framework. The changes are not necessarily the result of the EU Framework, but it provided important momentum to address the issue. In Austria , the EU Framework did not largely contribute to mainstreaming Roma integration per se, as Roma integration had already been mainstreamed in a number of policies. The EU Framework brought an additional contribution as a number of NRIS measures contributed to the already existing mainstreaming. The Spanish case study indicates that the EU Framework contributed to the mainstreaming of Roma integration in national policies, changing the approach to tackle these issues. In Slovakia , legislative acts were implemented following 2011, and stakeholders noted the role of the EU Framework in providing a boost for such initiatives. However, multiple stakeholders noted the risk of the NRIS actually concentrating integration of Roma into one document, rather than mainstreaming it across national policies. In other cases, no evidences could be gathered on the influence of the EU Framework on the mainstreaming of Roma integration in national legislation and policies. This was the case for Italy , for example, where overall no reference to the extent to which Roma integration is mainstreamed into national policies after 2011. In Hungary , the case study shows that the EU Framework and the NRIS had very little or no influence on the mainstream legislation and, moreover, the laws adopted after 2010 often directly contradict and thus hinder the realisation of the NRIS objectives. In Greece , most policies, which followed the adoption of the NRIS, tackled poverty and vulnerable groups in general. Roma are referred to in some action plans developed following the adoption of the EU Framework. In the enlargement and neighbourhood region further reforms are needed to ensure the protection of the rights of Roma in practice 220 . In the four policy areas (i.e. education, health, employment and housing), across the EU Member States and the enlargement countries, evidence shows that the EU Context of Mid-Term Review of Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2012-2020, 2017, http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/Lessons%20Learnt%20EU%20Framework%20for%20Natio nal%20Roma%20Integration%20Strategies%202012%202020.pdf. 219 UN-OHCHR, Lessons Learned: Views in the Context of Mid-Term Review of Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2012-2020, 2017, http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/Lessons%20Learnt%20EU%20Framework%20for%20Natio nal%20Roma%20Integration%20Strategies%202012%202020.pdf. 220 Communication from The Commission to the European Parliament and the Council (2013) Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2013-2014, COM(2013) 700 final and Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions (2018), A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans, COM(2018) 65 final.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 63 Framework has contributed to mainstreaming Roma integration into national policies to a limited extent. Evidence of coherence is particularly limited in the health sector. The lack of targeted policies and data, and lack of political will at national level, are emphasised as factors impeding such mainstreaming. In the education area, the EU Framework for NRIS has contributed through targeted and mainstream education measures over the period 2011-2016. In terms of employment , objectives were generally part of mainstream policies, often however without specific targeted measures nor a specific reference to Roma inclusion into the labour market. In terms of housing, Roma inclusion measures have taken the form of short-term actions rather than more systematically longer-term programmes. In general, as noted in the country analyses, there has been an overall reluctance to include specific references to Roma and their specific needs into mainstream policies to avoid singling out a specific vulnerable group over another. Often, thematic policies address vulnerable or disadvantaged groups in general, without however referring to the particular needs of specific groups, including Roma. Indeed, a large part of the of the OPC respondents (88.9%) identified the lack of effective mainstreaming of Roma inclusion in policy as one of the main challenges at EU level in the 2011-2016 period, following the implementation of the EU Framework. The same proportion of respondents noted insufficient mainstreaming of Roma inclusion in other policies and instruments at national level as well. Workshop participants also noted a need for more mainstreaming of Roma integration. It was suggested, for example, that specific Roma indicators should be used to implement the EU framework and NRIS on the ground, in terms of budget allocations and funding. At both national and sub-national levels, a lack of political will has been recorded: 87.2% of the OPC respondents identified a lack of commitment of politicians at national and local levels as one of the main challenges for Roma inclusion between 2011 and 2016. Moreover, the 2015 Parliament evaluation of the EU framework notes a lack of an \u201cintegrated holistic approach to the multi-sectoral and intersectional challenges of Roma inclusion\u201d as well as \u201cinsufficiently clear differentiation of roles and responsibilities between the different levels of government in Member States coupled with inadequate administrative capacity at all levels of government\u201d 221 . In addition, increased coherence should be pursued with regard to gender specific and child sensitive strategic approaches at national level, as emphasised in the 2016 Commission report 222 assessing the EU framework implementation. The following sub-sections provide more details on the contribution of the EU framework specifically in the policy areas of education, health, employment and housing at national levels. Education The EU Framework for NRIS has contributed to some extent to the mainstreaming of Roma education integration into national policies. The statement is underpinned by results of the 2017 Commission Mid-term review, where MS reported targeted and mainstream measures in the area 223 . In the meantime, important challenges remain. 221 European Parliament, Evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies, 2015, http://www.lse.ac.uk/business-and-consultancy/consulting/assets/documents/evaluation-of-the-EU- Framework-for-National-Roma-Integration-Strategies.pdf. 222 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Assessing the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the Council Recommendation on Effective Roma Integration Measures\u2019, COM (2016) 424, p. 9. 223 Based on FRA\u2019s EU-MIDIS II survey in 2016, MS reported 163 targeted and 115 mainstream measures in relation to education over the period 2011-2016.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 64 Insights gained from the country studies suggest a slight improvement in coherence between the NRIS and the main national thematic policies in some Member States 224 . On the other hand, a reluctance to include specific references to Roma and their specific needs was noted, with responsible authorities claiming that this would be bad practice from an equality perspective, as it would single out Roma from the general public and/or other vulnerable/ethnic groups 225 . Areas where the EU framework is commonly found to have contributed to mainstreaming relate to: ECEC provisions, the fight against drop-outs and furthering primary school participation. In addition, legislative measures have been adopted to tackle school segregation as a result of the infringement proceedings by the European Commission against three Member States (Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia), while legislative and policy development towards desegregation have been identified in Bulgaria and Romania. Health There is limited evidence to suggest that the EU Framework contributed to mainstreaming Roma integration into national policies in the health sector. The 2017 Commission Mid-term review states that the EU framework has led to several positive developments , including among others directly managed EU funding (under the Public Health Programme) that has financed initiatives to promote equal access to healthcare 226 . The main policy measures implemented in (some 227 ) Member States are targeted ones, in particular the health mediators 228 . Employment Evidence suggests that the EU Framework has contributed to some extent in mainstreaming Roma integration into employment policies, which is reflected in the fact that many Member States in their design of mainstream employment policies have taken into consideration the needs of vulnerable groups , including Roma. However, the number of specific references to addressing Roma employment needs in accordance with the EU Framework is rather limited. Besides, as for health and housing, implementation of such policies and measures is still lagging behind in most Member States. In Austria and France Roma inclusion and access to the labour market is addressed by a \u201cset of integrated measures\u201d within the overall national social inclusion policy, hence employment measures envisaged under the NRIS are the same as those implemented under national employment policies. 229 In Finland , the employment policies and measures for Roma are clearly connected with the EU Framework for NRIS and jointly implemented by Ministries. Finland, where the NRIS measures are connected to EU programmes, provides a good example of linking the EU Framework with other EU policies, coordinating all Roma initiatives and hence ensuring that these are properly connected to relevant EU programmes. In Romania, Spain, Bulgaria and Serbia , the National Employment Strategies clearly refer to Roma inclusion. In Hungary and Czech Republic , the specific needs of long- term unemployed Roma are addressed with changes to active employment policies and programmes so as to respond to Roma employment needs in a more coherent way to the public employment services. In Greece , the creation of employment opportunities 224 For instance: CS-HU, CS-IT, CS-RO. 225 For instance: CS-ES, CS-AT, CS-BG. 226 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final. 227 CS-AT and CS-FR showed that no targeted measures were adopted there. 228 CS-FR; CS-BG; CS-RO. 229 CS-AT; CS-FR ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 65 for Roma has been aligned explicitly but not exclusively with policies and measures to create employment opportunities of vulnerable groups in general. Housing There is little evidence to suggest that Member States have introduced changes in mainstream housing policies with the objective of promoting access specifically for Roma aside from few Member States. Instead, Roma inclusion has made its way into national policy agendas mainly through short-term actions or local level policy measures. Roma have nevertheless benefited from mainstream approaches targeting vulnerable , socially excluded or economically disadvantaged populations 230 , including through measures financed via ERDF funds 231 . This is the case of initiatives promoting equal access to housing, but also of measures aimed to improve the conditions of people living in camps (which can include migrant Roma and Travellers, such as in France). Some mainstream measures were likely to exclude Roma, on the basis of eligibility criteria that could be not met by Roma (e.g. formal and continuous employment to access to benefits; having built or bought a newly constructed home to access forms of housing support) 232 . One positive example of local level mainstreaming has been identified in Italy , where specific circumstances of the Roma housing situation (i.e. living in camps) were included as eligibility criterion when applying for social housing in the municipality of Rome. The INTEGRA scheme implemented in Bulgaria between 2013 and 2015 was a positive example of a local mainstream measures, where ESIF funds were used to provide modern social housing in four municipalities, while also addressing employment, education, and health issues related to integration of disadvantaged and vulnerable people, including Roma 233 . In Austria and France , the Roma issue was also included into existing programmes and were mainly nationally funded 234 . In Romania and Bulgaria , Roma also benefited from mainstream land register reforms, which is an important pre-condition to the legalisation of settlements 235 . 3.3.1.2 To what extent did the EU Framework contribute to linking Roma integration priorities with EU funding? The coordination mechanisms established under the EU Framework were successful in ensuring that EU Framework priorities were considered in a range of EU funding (see table below). It is unclear, to what extent the 2007 \u2013 2013 partnership agreements or operational programmes were amended and funds reallocated following the adoption of the EU Framework, as already Roma had been targeted by EU funds prior to the adoption of the EU Framework. Following the adoption, the funding for Roma was further aligned in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework. The Roma-specific ex-ante conditionality and ESF Investment Priority 9ii, as well as the eligibility of housing actions under ERDF have provided additional opportunities to invest in Roma needs 236 .

These types of measures have also potentially a huge beneficial impact on Roma inclusion 237 . The EU framework called on Member States to make full use of EU funds for Roma integration. In the 2007-2013 EU programming period, EU funding mechanisms for Member States took a mainstreaming approach towards disadvantaged groups/regions, without explicitly targeting Roma 238 . Overall, this period was characterised by a rather weak alignment between EU policies and funds. The Court of Auditor\u2019s audit analysed projects for Roma integration carried out under the 2007 \u2011 2013 programme period. The audit results found that while the projects examined were in line with the OP objectives, \u2018selection procedures did not specifically aim to select Roma inclusion-related projects\u2019 239 . The 2014-2020 programming period is characterised by an enhanced alignment between the EU Framework and ESIF. In this period, ex-ante conditionalities were introduced under ESIF 240 . In total, 36 ex-ante conditionalities (7 of which are general and 29 are thematic) aim at an effective use of EU funds. Ex-ante conditionalities represent pre-conditions that Member States must fulfil when submitting the Partnership Agreement, in which national authorities detail how they will use the EU funding. If a Member State does not fulfil an ex-ante conditionality, it will have to present the European Commission with an action plan and a timetable for its 237 European Court of Auditors, Special Report: EU policy initiatives and financial support for Roma integration: significant progress made over the last decade, but additional efforts needed on the ground, 2016, https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR16_14/SR_ROMA_EN.pdf. 238 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final. 239 European Court of Auditors, Special Report: EU policy initiatives and financial support for Roma integration: significant progress made over the last decade, but additional efforts needed on the ground, 2016, https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR16_14/SR_ROMA_EN.pdf. 240 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final.

The Commission may, in case of failure to fulfil an applicable ex ante conditionality, suspend interim payments to the relevant priorities of the programme. Among the criteria to fulfil the thematic conditionality, the ESIF introduced a direct link to Roma integration policy priorities with EU funding as one of the ESF investment priorities explicitly mentions Roma: investment priority (IP) 9ii \u2018Integration of marginalised communities such as the Roma\u2019. The ex-ante conditionalities associated with IP 9ii is: \u2018[\u2026] a national Roma inclusion strategic policy framework is in place\u2019 which needs to meet the following criteria 241 : \uf09f It sets achievable national goals for Roma integration to bridge the gap with the general population. These targets should address the four EU Roma integration goals relating to access to education, employment, healthcare and housing: - identifies disadvantaged micro-regions or segregated neighbourhoods where communities are most deprived; - includes strong monitoring methods to evaluate the impact of Roma integration actions and a review mechanism for the adaptation of the strategy; - is designed, implemented and monitored in close cooperation and continuous dialogue with Roma civil society, regional and local authorities. The 2014-2020 programming period also ensures a clear link between policy priorities in the European Semester and EU funding 242 . Member States receiving CSRs calling for a better involvement of Roma children and youth in inclusive mainstream education, needed to select IP 9ii and use the funding to transform their school systems to promote more inclusive education 243 . These interactions led to a better alignment of EU funds with policy priorities, including those set forth in the Europe 2020 Strategy. A significant majority of the OPC respondents agreed that the EU Framework resulted in several positive developments between 2011 and 2016. In particular, more than three quarters of the respondents recognised that Roma inclusion became high on the EU policy agenda and that more funding was earmarked for projects promoting Roma inclusion over the 2011-2016 period 244 . The Daphne III Programme , with a total budget of 123.88 million EUR supported preventive measures and support and protection for victims and groups at risk. Twelve projects (out of 302) with a total budget 3,597,554 EUR (3% of total funding) specifically targeted Roma. The projects focused on preventing hate-crimes, child abuse and the trafficking of vulnerable sub-groups in the Roma community (children and women). Some of the supporting preventive measures provide support and protection for victims and groups at risk. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme (REC) established in 2013 offers another opportunity to support Roma integration. REC aims, among other specific objectives, to promote the effective implementation of non-discrimination and preven and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. The interim evaluation of the REC programme found a high level of coherence between the objectives and 241 Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. 242 European Court of Auditors, Special Report: EU policy initiatives and financial support for Roma integration: significant progress made over the last decade, but additional efforts needed on the ground, 2016, https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR16_14/SR_ROMA_EN.pdf. 243 Ibid. 244 Open Public Consultation paper, p.33.

In addition, there is alignment between REC and the EU Framework. The REC includes call for proposal to support project on Roma integration. It notably funds National Roma Contact Points and support National Roma Platforms. Some areas of improvement have also been identified in the literature and by stakeholders: \uf09f The need is to ensure that ex-ante conditionalities are formulated in the context of the anti-discrimination legislation 246 . In particular, ensuring alignment during planning and implementation, so that EU funding supports desegregation . \uf09f It seems Member States have made less use of ESIF to finance measures in the area of anti-discrimination than in the area of social inclusion, as few included non-discrimination investment priority (9.3) in their OPs. According to the Court of Auditors, \u201c[t]his is a missed opportunity to support anti \u2011 discrimination measures that could be integrated with measures under IP 9ii, hence enhancing the chances for initiatives on Roma inclusion to be more effective, since the lack of anti \u2011 discrimination measures is considered as one of the main reasons why Roma inclusion measures can fail\u201d 247 . During the 2007-2013 programming period, the 2015 Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma Communities 248 finds that the EU IPA funding mechanisms took both a mainstreaming and a targeted approach towards disadvantaged groups/regions, including for Roma. Such dualistic approach is continued during IPA II. Similar as for Member States, IPA II funds National Roma Contact Points and support National Roma Platforms (called Public Dialogue Forums) through the multi-country Roma Integration 2020 initiative. 3.3.1.3 To what extent did the EU Framework contribute to fighting discrimination against Roma under European legislation (such as the Racial Equality Directive, the Council Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia and Directive 2011/36/EU of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims)? The EU Framework has played a role in the application of EU anti-discrimination legislation in the use of infringement procedures to address the segregation of Roma children in education. However, lack of specific measurable targets on non- discrimination outside the four areas and lack of recognition of anti-Gypsyism as driving factor of Roma exclusion in the EU Framework reduces its application potential and coherence with the strong EU legislation in the area. The social-economic inclusion standards of the EU Framework and the legal provisions of the EU legal instruments are, in terms of aims and scope, highly complementary. The enforcement of the EU legislation by the Commission can strengthen the policy 245 European Commission, Interim evaluation of the 2014-2020 Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, 2018. 246 Migration Policy Group, Promoting the implementation of European Union equality and non-discrimination standards in the programming and implementation of structural funds with respect to Roma, 2013, http://www.migpolgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Promoting-EU-Non-discrimination-and-Equality- standards-in-the-programming-and-implementation-of-Structural-Funds-with-respect-to-Roma_layout- FINAL.pdf , p. 30. 247 European Court of Auditors, Special Report: EU policy initiatives and financial support for Roma integration: significant progress made over the last decade, but additional efforts needed on the ground, 2016, https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR16_14/SR_ROMA_EN.pdf. 248 Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma communities, European Commission, 2015, available at: https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cc11f8-e10a-11e5-8a50- 01aa75ed71a1/language-en.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 69 objectives of the EU Framework, while vice versa the monitoring and implementation of the EU Framework informs the Commission on the state of play of the EU legislation and supports its practical application. While the EU Framework has contributed to fighting discrimination against Roma, by focussing on the specific forms of discrimination they face (i.e. segregation), it does not include measurable targets with regards to the horizontal anti-discrimination area and, in particular regarding anti-Gypsyism. In fact, as highlighted by the Court of Auditors, the EU Framework addressed discrimination as a cross-cutting aim throughout the four areas. While Member States are asked to adopt measures to end segregation, there are no anti-discrimination measures separate to the four areas. Accordingly, the absence of specific measures and targets in the horizontal requirement is a significant shortcoming of the framework, as it makes it difficult to measure progress made 249 . The lack of set objectives and measurable targets also diminishes the impact of the non-discrimination theme in the Framework. This constitutes a missed opportunity for the EU Framework to effectively contribute to fighting discrimination against Roma under European legislation. In fact, fighting discrimination and racism plays a key role in Roma integration, in particular tackling the issue of anti-Gypsyism . The absence of attention to anti-Gypsyism in EU policies has been noted by CEPS: a \u201cconsistent, mainstreamed and structured EU rule of law approach covering the anti-Gypsyism phenomenon is by and large lacking\u201d 250 . An overwhelming majority of the respondents to the OPC (94%) agreed that discrimination of Roma by the majority is a driving factor to the social exclusion of Roma. 251 As highlighted by FRA (2018), \u201cthe scourge of anti-Gypsyism has proven to be a formidable barrier to efforts to improve the life chances and living standards for Roma\u201d 252 . In light of the strong EU anti-discrimination legislation, the weak focus on anti-discrimination of the EU Framework appears at odds. Roma are recognised as one of the groups facing most discrimination , which is also one of the main factors hindering their integration. The EU legal framework provides for opportunities at Member State level to advance policies of positive action 253 . The Commission\u2019s monitoring of the implementation of the Directives and sanctioning in case of conformity issues plays an important role in supporting some of the goals of the EU Framework. For example, based on the Racial Equality Directive, it launched infringement procedures concerning school segregation of Roma children against three Member States 254 . Public perception shows that the EU Framework is also considered to have increased the attention of the Commission and other EU institutions on the proper application of the relevant EU acquis: 69% of the OPC suggested that the main achievements at EU level on Roma integration included the 2013 Council Recommendation which increased attention on areas such as anti-discrimination and protection of Roma children and women; fighting discrimination against Roma by launching infringement proceedings 249 European Court of Auditors, Special Report: EU policy initiatives and financial support for Roma integration: significant progress made over the last decade, but additional efforts needed on the ground, 2016, https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR16_14/SR_ROMA_EN.pdf. 250 Centre for European Policy Studies, Research Report: Combating Institutional Anti-Gypsyism.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 70 under the Racial Equality Directive; and fighting anti-Roma hate speech and hate crime under the Council Framework Decision on combatting Racism and Xenophobia. The EU has adopted several legal safeguards which are particularly relevant for Roma; including prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin in accessing education, housing, employment and health, among others (Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC), prohibition of incitement to violence or hatred (Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA). There are other relevant legal instruments, such as the Anti- Trafficking Directive (Directive 2011/36/EU) and related policy frameworks 255 . The Racial Equality Directive is the most relevant instrument in relation to the EU Framework, because they both cover the four key areas (education, employment, health and housing) and the Directive identifies Roma as a vulnerable ethnic group. According to the Migration Policy Group\u2019s 2014 report 256 , there is a strong relationship between the EU Framework and the Racial Equality Directive, whereby the term \u201csegregation\u201d should be construed as \u201ca duty to desegregate\u201d. Indeed, the existing EU Framework imposes a positive obligation on Member States to desegregate. The Directive and the Framework are thus complementary in the fight against discrimination. The Commission launched several infringement cases under the Racial Equality Directive on the discrimination of Roma children in education and investigated discrimination in education in 2014, 2015 and 2016, on the ground that Roma children were disproportionately over-represented in special schools for children with disabilities and segregated education in mainstream schools 257 . The infringement proceedings come 10 years after the landmark decision of the ECtHR (D.H. and others v Czech Republic) ruling that the segregation of Roma children in special classes and schools violated the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission\u2019s infringement procedures reinforce the socio-economic standards under the EU Framework. 258 They come within a context of the Commission\u2019s strong commitment to tackle discrimination based on ethnicity and race in the EU, including the EU framework, which most likely influenced the decision to launch the infringement proceedings. There is consensus that infringement procedures as a tool should be further used to advance Roma integration 259 . About 83% of the OPC respondents considered that measures relating to the monitoring and enforcement of EU anti-discrimination laws as very useful to fight limited political commitment to deliver ambitious public policies for Roma integration 260 . However, experts found that measures of desegregation adopted as a result of the infringement proceedings by the European Commission may in some instances lead to further discrimination. For instance, in Slovakia, the legislative amendments \u2018do not challenge the division between \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018special\u2019 schools and classes, and the legislation currently in force still retains the concept of a child who is 255 EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in human beings 2012-2016; Commission Communication \"Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards Eradication trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions (COM(2017)728). 256 Migration Policy Group, Promoting the implementation of European Union equality and non-discrimination standards in the programming and implementation of structural funds with respect to Roma, 2013, http://www.migpolgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Promoting-EU-Non-discrimination-and-Equality- standards-in-the-programming-and-implementation-of-Structural-Funds-with-respect-to-Roma_layout- FINAL.pdf. 257 Additionally, the Commission launched an infringement proceeding against Romania under the RED challenging a provision in Romanian legislation which appeared to allow a special category of indirect discrimination in the area of land management and planning.

Furthermore, the newly enacted legislation does not attempt to remedy the crucial problem of the misdiagnosis and stigmatisation of Roma children as intellectually disabled\u2019. 261 The Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia prohibits anti-Roma hate speech in the form of publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race or ethnic origin. It also prohibits hate crime, in requiring the establishment of aggravating circumstance for racist motivated crimes 262 . The Decision only covers the most severe forms of hatred and racism and is not area specific. The OPC results show that across the EU15 and EU13, a clear majority of the respondents believed that anti-Gypsyism was more severe today than it was in 2011 and almost three-quarters of the respondents from EU13 held the view that anti-Gypsyism had been on the rise in recent years. Workshop participants also stressed the need to tackle anti-Gypsyism as a very specific form of discrimination. As highlighted by the Workshop participants, the EU Framework looks at specific thematic areas, without identifying the institutional behaviour influenced by explicit/implicit anti-Gypsyism attitudes in order to create success. In fact, the EU Framework does not mention anti-Gypsyism. This highlights a need for further coherence between social inclusion, anti-racism and fundamental rights approaches, as well as a complex funding strategy. In particular, there is a need for a combined investment in addressing anti-Gypsyism. This constitutes a limiting factor for the EU Framework contribution to fighting discrimination against Roma under European legislation. In fact, such an interconnection should be fostered. The EU Framework\u2019s lack of recognition of anti-Gypsyism as a driving factor of Roma exclusion hinders a full coherence with the Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia. An explicit recognition of anti-Gypsyism together with targets, could contribute to further coherence with the Framework Decision and facilitate mainstreaming Roma inclusion in EU anti-discrimination policies. Workshop participants agreed that the focus on anti-Gypsyism should, in fact, be increased and objectives developed in the EU framework. The Anti-Trafficking Directive 263 establishes minimum rules on the definition of criminal offences and sanctions of trafficking in human beings. It also introduces common provisions, taking into account the gender perspective, to strengthen the prevention of this crime and the protection of the victims thereof. Roma are particularly vulnerable to trafficking due to their social and economic marginalisation; Romani women and children are especially vulnerable. Yet, the EU Framework does not mention trafficking in human beings and, thus, has not contributed directly to addressing it. The need to address trafficking in human beings in the context of Roma integration was first acknowledged in the 2013 Council Recommendation on effective Roma integration measures as part of integrated approach to protect Roma women and children from discrimination and violence. Also in 2013, the EP called on Member States to support victims by including specific objectives to tackle the trafficking of Roma women in the NRIS. These included ensuring resources for providing assistance through mainstream services, such as health, employment and education 264 .

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 72 JUSTROM programme partly addresses this need. The programme is a joint pilot project implemented by the Council of Europe and the European Commission in Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Romania. It aims to empower Roma and Traveller women by raising awareness on their rights and access to justice system and services where their can lodge complaints against discrimination and other human rights violations including early/forced marriage and trafficking. 3.3.1.4 To what extent did the monitoring and guidance provided by the European Commission (under the EU Framework, the European Semester, and European legislation such as the Racial Equality Directive) identify relevant points for improving effectiveness of Roma integration efforts? Being a specialised instrument on Roma integration, the Commission\u2019s monitoring of the implementation of the EU Framework has helped to identify several key priorities to improve Roma integration efforts. Additional monitoring reports focussed on Roma have also identified points for improvement, including the FRA reports on Roma, the Court of Auditor\u2019s 2016 Roma integration report and the reports by the European network of legal experts in gender equality and non-discrimination analysing issues around Roma and the enforcement of anti-discrimination law. The Commission\u2019s monitoring under the Racial Equality Directive and the European Semester\u2019s contribution have each helped to identify points for improvement in the area of education. Monitoring requirements of the implementation of EU instruments are established within the instruments\u2019 own provisions. Under Article 17 of the Racial Equality Directive , since 2005 Member States have had to report to the Commission on the implementation of the Directive every five years. Based on the information received by Member States, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and the viewpoints of social partners and relevant NGOs, the Commission draws up a report addressed to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Directive. To date, the Commission has launched infringement proceedings to address issues related to the segregation of Roma children, which aim to help improving integration efforts in this area. The infringement proceedings demonstrate a particular attention to Roma integration issues in relation to the implementation of the Directive. Coherence has thus been established between the EU Framework and the Directive monitoring. Nevertheless, in its last report on the implementation of the Racial Equality Directive, the Commission argues that Roma-specific problems rarely stem from EU legislation or its transposition into national law itself, but rather from how the legislation is applied in practice 265 . There would however be scope in reviewing whether the Directive could be improved, or further guidance provided on its practical application, to limit the extent to which Member States can still adopt practices which are de facto discriminatory. As spelled out in the EU Framework, realising EU Roma goals is important if Member States are to achieve the overall Europe 2020 targets, as growth cannot be achieved with persistent economic and social marginalisation of the EU\u2019s largest minority 266 . The European Semester provides a framework for coordinating economic and related social policies across the EU. The European Commission supports the implementation of 265 European Commission, \u2018Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Joint Report on the application of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (\u2018Racial Equality Directive\u2019) and of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (\u2018Employment Equality Directive\u2019)\u2019, COM (2014) 2 final. 266 European Commission, 2011, An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020, COM(2011) 173/4.

The 2016 Mid-term review notes that since 2012, the five Member States with the largest Roma communities have received CSRs aimed at furthering Roma inclusion. In 2014 CSRs were given to Hungary (Roma poverty reduction), to Romania and Bulgaria (Roma employment and education), to the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Roma education). In 2015 all five MS received CSRs focusing on measures to ensure that Roma children participate in quality inclusive education 267 . The 2017 OSEPI report is however critical of how the Roma-specific CSRs have focused on education, and not also on other areas of exclusion, e.g., housing. According to the report, Member States\u2019 responses to the CSRs were inadequate. Lastly, it suggests that the National Reform Programmes within the European Semester should explicitly include the NRIS objectives, as part of the CSR obligations. 268 As for the EU Framework , the Commission must report annually to the European Parliament and to the Council on progress of Roma integration in the countries and on the achievement of the goals. In its annual reports, the Commission has to date identified a number of positive developments, as well as challenges, and provided some way forward to improve integration efforts at national and EU level. For example, the Commission called - as a priority - the enforcement of the anti-discrimination and anti-racism legislation, the elimination of segregation in education and housing , the prevention of evictions on the grounds of ethnic origin, targets for Roma integration mainstreaming , the multiplication of smaller scale initiatives, data collection, in addition to making full use of National Roma Platforms 269 . Those priorities mostly align with those identified by the OPC respondents, aside from employment, which about 50% of respondents identified as key priority. The five most frequently cited priority areas for action at the EU and national level identified by the respondents were access to education, followed by access to employment, fighting discrimination, anti-Gypsyism and access to housing 270 . Overall, the reporting mechanism from the European Commission, the reports from the FRA on Roma, and civil society monitoring, were seen as positive developments 271 . Some of their limitations are explained in more detail in 3.6.1.1. A few points where monitoring could better contribute to Roma integration efforts have been identified: \uf09f Countries only reported about process indicators; in order to measure overall development and effectiveness of the interventions in a post- 2020 scenario, EU MS and enlargement Countries should report on outcome indicators. \uf09f Anti-Gypsyism and its various forms of expressions, which are an obstacle to effective inclusion policies 272 , have not been an integral part of Member States monitoring systems. 267 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final. 268 Open Society Institute, Report: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, 2017, https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/revisiting-eu-roma- framework-assessing-european-dimension-post-2020-future, p. 13. 269 European Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Assessing the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the Council Recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States \u2013 2016, COM(2016) 424 final. 270 Open Public Consultation paper, pp. 27, 28 and 111. 271 Stakeholders Workshop, Brussels, March 2018 272 See FRA (2018) A Persisting Concern: anti-Gypsyism as a Barrier to Roma Inclusion.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 74 3.3.1.5 To what extent is the EU Framework coherent with other EU policies? The EU Framework is coherent overall with a number of EU flagship initiatives and social policies, such as the Youth Guarantee. Even though Roma issues and integration are taken into account in these policies and/or their related processes, albeit to a varying extent, a number of gaps have been identified, such as the need for closing capacity gaps in the Youth Guarantee 273 . An example of coherence is the mainstreaming of Roma integration in the EU urban agenda. EUROCITIES\u2019 2017 report on the situation of Roma in cities in Europe maps the situation in terms of Roma integration at local level across 23 large cities in Europe 274 . The report provides recommendations to allow for a better mainstreaming of Roma integration into urban policies, noting the crucial role of cities in tackling social exclusion. The EU framework is also found to be coherent with EU anti-trafficking policies. In the various deliverables under the 2012-2016 EU Strategy towards eradicating trafficking in human beings, at numerous occasions, the situation of Roma and their particular risks and vulnerability are referred to, in line with the comprehensive EU anti-trafficking legal and policy framework 275 . There are certain gaps between the EU Framework and other EU policies. The 2017 OSEPI report 276 calls for more institutional alignment, and for greater synergy across DGs in implementing the framework. The active involvement of other DGs is seen as necessary to guarantee greater internal coherence. The DG JUST Roma Task Force\u2019s work is key to achieve coherence in Member States, as is the work of the DG NEAR in the enlargement and neighbourhood region. As presented in the subsections below, in the four policy areas (i.e. education, health, employment and housing) the assessment of the coherence of the EU framework against other EU policies gives similar mixed results. Overall, the evidence reviewed suggests that the EU Framework is not fully taken up in relevant EU policies. Education Coherence of the EU framework with other EU policies in the area of education is partial , as the evidence reviewed suggests that the Framework and its related objectives are not fully taken up in the main EU education and social policies. The 2011 Council Recommendation 277 on policies to reduce early school leaving targets vulnerable groups, including Roma. Indirectly, the Education and Training (ET) 2020 278 strategic framework also creates links and synergies with the EU Framework through its set of objectives. In the same vein, reference to Roma integration is made across several EU-level policy documents such as the Youth Guarantee , the New Skills Agenda for Europe and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships (EAfA).

As part of the European Semester, the European Commission\u2019s Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) include objectives which broadly match those of the EU Framework, around for example ECEC, inclusive education and early school leaving. Five EU Member States (BG, CZ, HU, RO and SK 280 ) were more specifically addressed by Roma-related CSR since 2012, including: \uf09f Increasing the provision of quality education \u2018in particular for Roma\u2019 (BG, HU, RO, SK); \uf09f Increasing the provision and quality of ECEC and care (RO); \uf09f Reducing early school leaving (HU); \uf09f Adapting systemic measures to address segregation in education (CZ, HU, RO 281 , SK). Health The EU Framework is deemed coherent with other EU policies in the area of health in the sense that it integrates into, and does not contradict, the general set of EU policies. If adopted, the European Commission proposal for a recast of the Drinking Water Directive would oblige Member States to provide access to water for vulnerable groups, including Roma. Member States would need to inter alia identify people without access to drinking water, possibilities for improved access, and to maintain outdoors and indoors equipment for free access to water in public spaces. The proposal refers directly to the 2011 EU Framework and the 2013 Council Recommendation on effective Roma integration. Nevertheless, and despite the references made to the EU Framework in other EU policies on healthcare, most stakeholders interviewed pointed out a limited coherence 282 . This can in part be explained by the limited health competences of the EU. Further analysis to explain limited coherence in the area of health is not possible due to lack of relevant information and evidence. Employment Roma integration is mentioned in key European employment initiatives, namely the Youth Guarantee, Skills Agenda, VET and Alliance for Apprenticeships, but properly linking these initiatives with Roma Integration is still a challenge. According to the country studies, even if the Roma NEET share is extremely high in all Member States and enlargement countries, only in some Member States, Roma youth and Roma NEETs benefit from labour market measures and training implemented under the \u201c Youth Guarantee\u201d initiative. However, as part of the public employment services, Roma youth benefit from active employment measures, despite the limited number of measures explicitly, but not exclusively, targeted to Roma people. Similarly, the use of IPA I and II has contributed to the mainstreaming of measures to promote Roma integration into employment in the enlargement countries. The employment initiatives funded under the IPA I were aligned with the NRIS in those countries . This is also the case for initiatives funded under IPA II. 279 COM SWD(2018) 67 final. 280 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=89&newsId=2868&furtherNews=yes. 281 Although the EC acknowledged the efforts of Romania in this regard. 282 EUI-3, EUI-4, EUI-6, EUI-8.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 76 Housing Housing policy is a competence of the Member States and few initiatives are found at EU level. Though Roma are not explicitly mentioned , certain Member States have targeted social inclusion, regeneration, and community-led local development efforts to benefit Roma according to the literature review . This also applies to the IPA funds. For example, Serbian officials noted that IPA funds programmed for social housing were aimed at Roma communities 283 . The Racial Equality Directive is an instrument that could be used to tackle discrimination against Roma in housing. However, as noted in the 2017 European network of legal experts\u2019 report, Roma are not benefitting equally from the non- discrimination legal frameworks as compared to other groups, and the lack of enforcement in instances of discrimination is very evident regarding housing 284 . 3.3.1.6 How could the linkages between the EU Framework and other European targeted and mainstream policy, legal and funding instruments be further improved? Please see the Recommendations section. 3.3.2 To what extent did National Roma Integration Strategies or integrated sets of policy measures contribute to mainstreaming Roma integration under public policies? The second evaluation question is focused on understanding potential synergies or inconsistencies between the National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) and national policies, policy monitoring tools and funding mechanisms. 3.3.2.1 To what extent did they contribute to linking Roma integration priorities with EU and national funding? Thanks to the ex-ante conditionality to have a Roma inclusion strategic policy framework in place and the IP 9ii, the level of coherence between EU funding and NRIS has increased. National funding has been allocated for the implementation of the NRIS, complementing or in addition to EU funding. However, when it comes to the implementation of the measures and actual spending of the allocated budgets, the data is incomplete and could be attributed to a number of issues between delays in implementation, lack of appropriate data collection or inadequate budgeting. Ex-ante conditionalities are considered a promising practice because they allow the Commission to better monitor Roma integration 285 . In terms of national funding , in the 11 countries 286 analysed in depth for this evaluation, national funding was allocated for the implementation of the NRIS, complementing EU funding. In the enlargement countries, all but Turkey have allocated specific funding (national/EU) for the implementation of the strategy.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 77 Turkey has allocated funds from the annual budgets of the relevant Ministries to implement some of the actions foreseen in the National Action Plan. In some countries, coherence has built over time between NRIS and funding mechanisms at national level, either through co-financing or increased national budget allocations for Roma integration measures. In six Member States, stakeholders\u2019 overall opinion was that national funding had increased as a result of the respective NRIS / set of policy documents (BE, BG, EL, FI, HR and PT). Table 13. Coherence between NRIS and national level funding- Illustrative examples In Austria , EU funding (ESF) was the main source of funding for the implementation of the NRIS. The coordination between the NRCP and the government for the implementation of the NRIS led to the allocation of ESF budget to targeted measures. National funds through the budgets of the respective Federal Ministries were also used to finance or co-finance some targeted measures 287 . In Greece , both EU and national funds have been used for the implementation of the NRIS measures. During the period 2007-2013, funds have been used for combating poverty and social exclusion, while a certain amount was spent for infrastructure improvements in areas where Roma communities reside. During the period 2014-2020, more funds have been allocated for social inclusion actions, targeting Roma among other vulnerable groups, especially under the new ESF investment priority 9ii 288 . Bulgaria has seen an increase in volume of funding directly or indirectly focused on Roma inclusion. Most of the funding originates from the ESIFs, and has contributed to the inclusion efforts of the national government 289 . In others, NRIS and national funding are not fully aligned and challenges arose with respect to its implementation , where the funding is not fully or sufficiently allocated. Table 14. Examples of coherence issues between NRIS and national funding In Czech Republic , national funding has been set in the NRIS. However, the funds have not always been made available in order to implement the measures. For example, the 2010-2013 policy objectives set the goal to place Roma coordinators at municipal level, and requested 60million CZK for it. However, the funds were never allocated, and the goal was not met 290 . In Spain , resources allocated to NRIS implementing measures have been insufficient and uncoordinated. Neither the Strategy nor the Operational Plan have established comprehensive funding for their implementation. \u201cThere are only two specific funds to support measures in this area, yet there is no evidence that the selection criteria were coherent with the NRIS objectives\u201d 291 . In Italy , the NRIS (2012) did not allocate sufficient funding from national budgets, which were to be complemented by international and EU funding.

As shown in Table 14 below, when reviewing the financial data provided by Member States as part of their reporting obligations on the implementation of the NRIS, a number of issues become apparent: \uf09f Some Member States reported allocated amounts repeatedly in 2015 and 2016. \uf09f The amounts spent are smaller than the allocated amounts. \uf09f There are data gaps \u2013 in certain policy areas where few policy measures have been adopted by MS, the data shows a total amount for EU-28, which in fact comprise reported amounts for only one or two MS. \uf09f Drawing a comparison with the overall amounts under investment priorities is not feasible due to the spread of funding across several years. \uf09f Some significant amounts are reported as \u2018other\u2019 and not allocated under specific policy objectives (e.g. much of education and housing funding). \uf09f Certain amounts are reported repeatedly across multiple policy areas (this is especially in the area of health, where Slovakia reported certain projects several times across several policy areas). Due to the above issues, it is difficult to assess the extent to which NRIS have contributed to link EU and national funding to Roma integration priorities. The lack of data may be the result of various issues, or a combination thereof, including a lack of proper reporting and/or recording of data on funding and inadequate budgeting (lack of allocation of funds for each NRIS measure). Table 15 presents the aggregated targeted funding as reported by certain Member States in 2015 and 2016. Overall, the level of funding spent is substantially lower than funding allocated. Whilst this is most likely primarily due to delays in implementation (and hence absorption of funding), it can also imply a de facto lower level of activity (i.e. insufficient measures or projects being funded / less disbursements to measures or projects made), or poor monitoring of the spending of funds.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 79 3.3.2.2 To what extent did the NRIS contribute to fighting discrimination, hate speech and hate crime against Roma, enforcing EU antidiscrimination and anti-racism legislation at national and local levels and addressing prevention and awareness- raising regarding trafficking in human beings? National Roma Integration Strategies have contributed to fighting discrimination, hate speech and hate crime against Roma in some Member States, while their contribution was minor or inexistent in others. Overall, combating discrimination has not been at the core of the NRIS. Specific anti-discrimination measures have been adopted in most NRIS examined under this evaluation (AT, BG, CZ, EL, FI, FR, IT, HU, RO, SK). Similarly, a number of NRIS include measures specifically to fight racism and hate crimes in e.g. AT, BG, FI, IT. More generally, several Member States have taken relevant practical steps to implement the planned measures. In Bulgaria , at national level, the NRIS is the only national example of a public policy directed against discrimination 294 . In Greece , following the adoption of the NRIS, various Strategies and Action Plans have been developed taking into consideration the objectives of the NRIS and the specific needs of Roma. In particular, the National Strategy for Social Inclusion 295 constitutes a horizontal framework of principles, priorities and actions for the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the policies aimed at combating poverty, social exclusion and discrimination at national, regional and local levels 296 . In Italy , the NRIS marked a step forward in terms of creating a positive momentum at the political and civil society level on anti-discrimination. The double nature of the National Office against Racial Discrimination ( Ufficio Nazionale Anti-discriminazioni razziali , UNAR) as both an anti- discrimination body and the NRCP allowed the strategy to be fully coherent with the anti-discrimination policies of the Italian government (Italian National Action Plan against racism, xenophobia and intolerance 2013-2015) 297 . However, evidence as to whether the measures have contributed to fighting discrimination and racism in practice is lacking . With respect to the areas of anti- discrimination, the majority of the OPC respondents thought that no significant change took place between 2011 and 2016. A sizeable share of the respondents indicated that the situation of Roma had deteriorated between 2011 and 2016 regarding discrimination (29.9%) 298 . The responses may reflect in part the growing context of intolerance in many countries and not the de facto situation. The NGO survey considered, on the other hand, that the NRIS of their respective Member State contributed to some extent to reducing discrimination against Roma (40%) and reducing hate speech against Roma (50%), reducing hate crimes against Roma (53%) and improving the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation (44%) during 2011-2017 299 . Furthermore, in some countries it was not possible to identify any clear contribution , either because relevant policy objectives and measures were absent from the NRIS (or measures in the NRIS), or because NRIS measures were not being implemented. In the Czech Republic , for example, the implementation measures of the NRIS are focused on monitoring rather than practical implementation and enforcement of the anti-discrimination law 300 . In Romania , despite the recognised high level of discrimination of Roma in every area of life, the NRIS has only a few provisions on combating discrimination. According to stakeholders, anti-discrimination should have 294 Bulgaria country case study. 295 Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Welfare, National Strategic Framework for Social Inclusion, Athens, 2014, Available from: http://www.ypakp.gr/uploads/docs/7695.pdf, (accessed 05 January 2018). 296 Greece country case study. 297 Italy country case study. 298 Open public consultation report, p.30. 299 NGO survey report, p.15. 300 Czech Republic country case study.

In Hungary , there is no clear, coherent anti- discrimination policy, nor is anti-discrimination a dominant issue in the strategy or action plans. While there is widespread discrimination of Roma in all spheres of life, the Government did not introduce effective measures to reduce discrimination, nor did it reinforce the existing anti-discrimination framework; rather, it made the whole system weaker by diminishing the independence of institutions dealing with anti-discrimination complaints 302 . Spain has no specific strategies at national or regional level, which makes it difficult to assess if coherence has improved. However, the fact that the Ethnic and Racial Origin Equality Body has not reported any action since 2013 shows a lack of coherence with the spirit and objectives of the NRIS 303 . With respect to trafficking in human beings , from the 11 Member States examined in depth for this evaluation, only two NRIS included targets or measures to combat trafficking. The contribution of the NRIS to the fight against trafficking appears thus marginal in most countries. Roma are particularly vulnerable to trafficking in human beings . It primarily affects Roma women and children, for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced begging and forced criminality (pickpocketing/underage girls). Targets and measures to combat trafficking in human beings are established in NRIS of only two of the countries researched for this evaluation (BG, HU), however others have taken measures against trafficking in Roma people. In Bulgaria , the NRIS includes the specific goal of increasing the efforts to combat trafficking in human beings by effectively applying the principles from EU and international instruments. In addition, the National Commission for Combating the Trafficking in Human beings implemented a project on the prevention of the trafficking Roma, among other ethnic groups 304 . In Hungary , the Action Plan I of the NRIS I sets forth 15 tasks, that includes \u201cTake targeted police action for the effective reduction of usury, human trafficking and forced prostitution.\u201d The National Strategy against Trafficking in Human Beings for 2013\u20132016 piloted a programme aiming to involve former victims in victim support activities as volunteers, and emphasises the need to involve former victims of Roma origin where Roma victims are significantly overrepresented. The impact of the anti-trafficking measures on Roma girls and women is however unclear, and even the Government was not able to estimate the number of Roma beneficiaries in the monitoring report 305 . The absence of any measures or targets for trafficking in NRIS is due to various reasons. However, the most common one is that the scale of the phenomenon cannot be assessed, as Member States do not collect data on victims of human trafficking based on ethnic origin, but rather on country citizenship 306 . For instance, Article 1 of the French Constitution requires that no distinction be made in terms of origin, race or religion. As a consequence, France does not have any laws or policies targeting specific ethnic groups and forbids related statistics and data collection. It is therefore not possible to assess the situation of Roma in relation to trafficking in France 307 . In some cases, such as Finland , it is estimated that trafficking is not a significant issue from the perspective of the Roma, and did not warrant the need for measures in the NRIS. In Austria , human trafficking was not explicitly tackled under the NRIS. However, the authorities responsible for dealing with the trafficking of human beings have reportedly been involved in the development, coordination and implementation of the 301 Romania country case study. 302 Hungary country case study. 303 Spain country case study. 304 Bulgaria country case study. 305 Hungary country case study. 306 AT_14interview, FR_11interview (and Serbia_WB1interview). 307 FR_11interview.

Overall, while there is no quantitative data, stakeholders believe that no change in the extent of the trafficking of human beings was evident since 2011. In Italy , the NRIS does not include measures or goals to combat human trafficking. Reliable data on the number of children involved in the phenomenon in question is not collected and the human trafficking phenomenon is difficult to investigate due its nature, i.e. taking place in concealed spaces, such as informal camps 309 . 3.3.2.3 How could the linkages between the NRIS and other national targeted and mainstream policy, legal and funding instruments be further improved? Please see the section on Recommendations. 3.4 Effectiveness Key findings The Roma integration goals set out in the EU Framework in respect to education, employment, healthcare and housing, have been achieved only to a limited extent. Evidence in most Member States shows that progress towards increasing the number of children enrolled in primary education, even though that has happened while school segregation has deepened. In respect to health, despite improvement in self-perception of health condition, there is little other evidence to support that the health status of Roma has substantially improved, as the life expectancy gap with the majority population remains substantial. In the area of employment, few targeted measures and labour market situations in Member States (in early 2016, when most recent data is available) prevented any substantial change of the high unemployment rates of Roma. In the area of housing the overall lack of targeted polices resulted in lack of improvement of Roma housing situation. The overall levels of poverty and discrimination remain high, despite some improvements observed in respect to discrimination in access to employment and health services. Discrimination continues to play a role preventing Roma from achieving social inclusion in the labour market and education, as well as in improving their living conditions. Besides EU (funded) policy measures, there were very few Member State government policy initiatives to target discrimination. While further progress can still be made in the remaining period, substantial changes are unlikely to take place. Changes in discriminatory attitudes or changes in health and education parameters take many years, or in the case of housing, also substantial investments (which have not been planned). The rapidly falling unemployment rates and labour shortages in the EU provide some conditions for improvement of the employment situation of Roma and may contribute to achieving some progress in that respect. The achievement of the EU Framework objectives has been also negatively impacted by fluctuations in political commitment, insufficient alignment of NRIS with the EU Framework general and specific objectives, insufficient or in some Member States even absence of funding for targeted policy measures, low absorption of EU funding in the 2014-2020 financial period, as well as insufficient capacity to design and implement targeted policy measures. The EU Framework contributed to a number of positive developments, such as: the adoption of NRIS by all Member States with significant Roma populations; the establishment of coordination mechanisms and structures at EU and national level for the implementation inclusion policies; the establishment of consultation and monitoring platforms and mechanisms involving civil society; mobilisation of EU funding and, in some Member States, national funding for implementation of the NRIS; 308 Austria country case study. 309 Italy country case study.

The EU Framework\u2019s objectives in the four policy areas have been achieved to a limited extent . As the table below and the analysis presented in sections 3.4.1.2-3.4.2.5 show, some limited success has been registered by FRA surveys in respect to access to education, where enrolment has significantly increased in a number of Member States. In respect to reducing the gap in health, survey data on \u2018self-reported health\u2019 status seems to indicate that the objective has been achieved. Nevertheless, the lack of objective statistical data on, for example, prevalence of diseases or life-expectancy of Roma does not allow to draw a firm conclusion. In respect to the objectives linked to accessing employment and housing, up until 2016 the situation seems to have overall remained unchanged, and even worsened in some Member States. While there is no official data on the above, and hardly any evaluations of the effects of policies on Roma in Member States, the interviews conducted as part of the country analysis reports largely support these conclusions. The reasons explaining the lack or limited progress are presented in the sections below. They range from persisting high levels of discrimination (see section 3.4.1.1), ineffective policies, to insufficient funding (see 3.4.3), to lack of political will, to macro-economic conditions.

While in access to education, there have been overall positive results that seem to be related to policies directly linked to EU Framework, in other policy areas the effects remain unclear. The self-reported improvement of the health status, experienced in most Member States, cannot be linked to particular policies implemented as a result of the EU Roma Framework, but rather to pre-existing (such as health mediators) or mainstream policies. The policy measures in the area of housing affected a very small part of the Roma population, there have been no sensible effects. Similarly, in employment, the large scale measures that reached significant part of the Roma population were mainstream measures, where links with the EU Framework are difficult to establish. In respect to the general objective of fighting poverty some progress has also been observed. According to the 2011 FRA Roma Survey, on average 87% of Roma population surveyed lived below the national poverty line. The situation has improved somewhat by 2016, where 80% of Roma surveyed were found to live below the national poverty line, with especially high rates in Greece, Spain and Croatia. Similarly, the extent of hunger experienced by Roma has decreased from 14% in 2011 to 7% in 2016 , reporting to having gone to bed hungry at least few times in the previous month.

Despite evidence of a reduction in discrimination experiences when accessing healthcare or employment, the levels of discrimination when accessing housing and employment that Roma experience remain high. In addition, while 46% of Roma people surveyed reported in 2011 that they had been the subject of discrimination in the last 12 months, this has decreased only slightly by 2016, with 41% of Roma surveyed reported having been subject to discrimination in the past 12 months.

Regarding education , overall levels of discrimination have somewhat decreased, as shown in the table above. Some Member States, Greece (11 percentage points decline) and Czech Republic (14 percentage points decline) 313 registered strong improvements but discrimination levels in these countries, when Roma are in contact with schools, remain overall high \u2013 close to 20%. In Croatia, the situation has even regressed. The country studies did not identify large-scale policy initiatives to tackle discrimination against Roma in schools. OPC respondents confirmed this, as 54% of them were of the opinion that no measures were implemented in their respective country to fight discrimination in education. With regard to discrimination patterns in employment , while some improvements have occurred according to the FRA survey, persistent prejudice and discrimination continue to undermine Roma 314 employment prospects . 315 Some stakeholders identified particularly private sector employment discrimination as the main driver that leads to 312 Gender aspects of discrimination are discussed in the section on Equity Error!

About half of OPC respondents were of the opinion that discrimination against Roma in the labour market was worse today than it was in 2011, while 35% conversely considered that the situation today was better than in 2011. A Eurobarometer survey on discrimination in the EU in 2015 showed that on average 20% of EU respondents said they would be largely uncomfortable working with a Roma person. This share is much higher in the Czech Republic (71%), Italy (63%), Slovakia (59%) and Bulgaria (57%). 316 In respect to healthcare discrimination, despite the positive trends substantial differences across countries exist: discrimination was lowest in Bulgaria (decreased from 8% to 2% between 2011 and 2016) while the largest decrease was registered in the Czech Republic (from 37% to 8% between 2011 and 2016). Greece (20%) and Romania (12%) remained the Member States with highest levels of healthcare discrimination. 317 Regarding housing discrimination , Slovakia was the only country recording a significant reduction of discrimination in access to housing (from 44% to 33%). In other Member States the situation became worse between 2011 and 2016: in Portugal, the share of people who felt being discriminated against increased from 67% to 75%, in Czech Republic from 52% to 65%, and in Spain from 35% to 45% 318 . The country analysis studies confirm these trends 319 , as well as discrimination in relation to social housing. 320 For example, in Sweden , half of the judgments and settlements (from Diskrimineringsombudsmannen ) on housing discrimination concern Roma. Other housing issues where discrimination plays a role also do not show much improvement. In respect to residential segregation of Roma, limited or no improvement has been recorded between 2011 and 2016 (e.g. 66% of Roma in Greece and 45% in Italy still live in segregated areas) 321 . More OPC respondents thought that segregation has not increased (43%) than those who thought it had increased (38.5%). 3.4.1.3 What have been the (quantitative and qualitative) effects of Roma integration measures implemented in Member States in education? Education has received most attention in Member States 322 and enlargement countries. This is the area where most tangible positive effects (both quantitative and qualitative) are seen since 2011 .

Data also highlights that upper-secondary general or vocational education completion rates have remained particularly low among Roma people aged 18-24 and 20-24 years old, as these accounted only for 12% and 15% until 2011, but since then, available evidence suggests some improvement. For instance, according to the 2016 EUMIDIS 2 329 , 61% of Roma surveyed over the age of 16 reported having completed at least upper secondary education. The share of school drop-outs before the age of 16 has also decreased among Roma girls. This has positive implications, as they were disproportionately pressured to drop out by this time 330 .

The country study notes that school segregation has increased, however recognises reduced early school leaving rates and rising ECEC participation. With regard to the main areas of improvements, the country studies frequently refer to improved school participation (ECEC and compulsory education) and primary education completion rates. Meanwhile, most reports highlight persistent gaps or inequalities between Roma and non-Roma pupils\u2019 education achievements whilst some Member States (e.g. Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Greece) flag the participation in special/segregated education or the prevalence of school dropouts as significant problems (e.g. Bulgaria, Finland). In relation to the enlargement countries , the situation shows no real improvement between 2011 and 2017. On the contrary, pre-primary school enrolment rates decreased in three out of six countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia) and remained unchanged in Albania. Improvement was registered in Montenegro only, whilst 2011 data is not available for Kosovo. Importantly, in most of the cases (except in Bosnia and Herzegovina), the gap between enrolment rates of Roma and non-Roma was not reduced 334 . NGO survey results reveal that 43% of the respondents felt that the Roma children\u2019s access to and integration to education systems has improved since 2011, while 20% believed this has worsened over the years. Additional insight is gained from the OPC results 335 , in which respondents were largely split in their opinion on the effectiveness of primary and ECEC measures, while for all other types negative perceptions prevailed.

One of the (unintended) effects of increased school attendance has been the increased rates of school segregation . On average, the share of Roma children attending classes where \u201call classmates were Roma\u201d increased from 10% to 15%. This outcome seems at least in part to be linked to the overall increase in early childhood / compulsory education enrolment rates in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, or Slovakia. 339 This is due to insufficient measures taken by MS to fight against segregate practices. 3.4.1.4 What have been the (quantitative and qualitative) effects of Roma integration measures implemented in Member States in employment? Since 2011, no progress has been made in improving Roma access to employment through either mainstream or Roma-targeted employment measures, while the employment gap between Roma and non-Roma remained stable. Some slight improvements in specific countries can largely be attributed to the end of economic recession rather than the implementation of the NRIS 340 . At national level, there are still too few targeted or mainstream measures that take into account Roma issues 341 .

In respect to enlargement countries, only the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has shown an improvement since 2011 in closing the inequality gap in employment and in providing more coverage of employment services to Roma. In fact, in three countries (Serbia, Albania and Montenegro) access to labour market has worsened. 343 Nearly half of the respondents to the NGO Survey and 80.3% of OPC respondents considered that the situation of the Roma in terms of access to employment has not changed since 2011, while some believed that the employment situation has been somewhat worse (15.4 of the respondents %) and even significantly worse (10.8%).

Most Member States have reported mainstream employment measures , such as training, subsidised jobs and public works, but also some were Roma-targeted measures and policies. However, many country analysis studies underlined the lack of evaluation and monitoring tools to assess the impact of these measures and policies on the Roma population. 345 As the figure below shows, respondents mostly singled out access to vocational training (47% rather agree) as the measure to improve Roma labour market integration which had most effect since 2011. For all the other potentially relevant measures, more than two-thirds of the respondents stated that no progress had been made in implementing them in their countries. Figure 5. Open Public Consultation \u2013 Measures taken in the field of employment since 2011 Some of the positive examples highlighted in the country analysis studies include the \u2018Empowerment of Roma in the Labour Market\u2019 programme in Austria, which constituted a milestone for Roma integration and had the largest effect in terms of outcomes 346 . In Bulgaria, the key competencies training programme was more successful than measures aimed at improving the professional qualifications for Roma participants. Its levels of completion were 75% for key competencies acquisition, compared 39% for vocational training participants. 347 In Spain , the long-established \u201cAcceder Programme\u201d developed personalised \u2018roadmaps\u2019 to assist young Roma to access the labour market. More than 87,000 people benefited directly from the programme, with Roma constituting 67% out of the beneficiaries, among them 53% Roma women. 348 In Greece during 2013-2015, the ESF project \u201cLocal actions for the social inclusion of vulnerable groups (TOP/EKO)\u201d provided employment opportunities to vulnerable 344 PT-5, SK-6 345 CS-FI, CS-IT, CS-EL, CS-AT, EL-03, EL-01 346 CS-AT, 347 CS-BG 348 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights Slovakia, Fundamental Rights Report, Annual report 2017 chapter 4 Roma Integration pg.108-110 ",

However, the implementation of the abovementioned measures only reached a small number of Roma people and it had limited impact on increasing Roma employability. 349 In Slovak Republic Roma are mostly targeted within the mainstream measures for the unemployed via trainings, subsidised jobs for the long term unemployed and through the activation work programmes. However, the employment mainstream measures have not proved to have tangible impact on increasing participation of Roma in the labour market. 350 In general, the country analysis studies and interviews 351 mention that the root causes of low employment of Roma \u2013 namely the low educational status, the lack of basic skills and discrimination \u2013 are not tackled effectively. Also, mainstream active employment measures typically lack explicit references to Roma and do not provide individualised support. Therefore, coupled with adverse economic conditions, the employment measures implemented failed to effectively reduce the employment gap between Roma and non-Roma. However, given the duration of the educational cycle and by considering the long-term qualitative effects of it, the improvement of the employment situation will likely become visible in the medium to long term. 3.4.1.5 What have been the (quantitative and qualitative) effects of Roma integration measures implemented in Member States in healthcare? Roma integration measures have sought to contribute to the objective of improved health status of the Roma. Evidence shows that health status of the Roma has improved since 2011, while access to medical insurance coverage largely declined, except in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Slovakia. In the enlargement countries, improvements were generally observed with respect to health insurance coverage and reduced inequality 352 . Montenegro experienced poorer outcomes in terms of both indicators while Serbia experienced greater inequality. As further discussed in Section 3.9 on Equity, differences can be noted between different groups of Roma in relation to access to health care, given that interviews with stakeholders at national level indicate that mobile EU Roma and Roma migrants still face many barriers in accessing health care services in several Member States, including France, Finland, Italy, Greece and Hungary.

However, the evaluation uncovered information on the different types of measures and their perceived impacts. The OPC provides stakeholder views on the perceived effects of different types of Roma integration measures (see figure below). Over 70% of respondents noted that no progress had been made in their countries with respect to the implementation of Roma integration measures in the area of healthcare 353 . Progress over this short time frame may be limited due to a range of significant, entrenched barriers such as language and literacy, a lack of trust, a lack of identification documents and physical distance 354 .

The effects observed may be enhanced in part by community health centres that are being piloted. In addition, about half of respondents to the OPC affirmed that \u2018health mediators have helped to improve the health status of Roma\u2019 ( OPC, response to Q14.2 ) 359 . The reviewed literature suggests that health mediators have been especially effective for support access to healthcare for women and girls 360 . More can be found on this topic in Section 3.9 on Equity. There are other Roma integration measures that are perceived to have been successful, but for which there is less supporting evidence. Such measures include vaccination campaigns for children 361 , food stations for babies 362 , free blood test campaigns and raising health awareness 363 . For example, in Bulgaria, specific focus has been placed on awareness raising for public health, disease prevention and limiting risky sexual behaviour 364 . Regarding the enlargement countries (i.e. Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro), research points out that by 2015 progress had been made, in the area of health, in large part thanks to health mediators, as well with their national strategies 365 . This progress included an increase in financial affordability of medicines and in overall perceived health status of Roma. 3.4.1.6 What have been the (quantitative and qualitative) effects of Roma integration measures implemented in Member States in housing? Between 2011 and 2016, the housing conditions of Roma people did no change in relation to most of the indicators (i.e. increased share of people living in households without tap water; increased share of people living in households having neither toilet, nor shower, nor bathroom), and improved for one (see Table 22 below).

Member States implement different type of measures in this sector, both mainstream and Roma-targeted, promoting non-discriminatory access to housing (including to social housing), fighting segregation, or improving the housing conditions in neighbourhoods with high concentration of Roma population and/other disadvantaged groups. Some Member States have put emphasis on providing legal housing and measures targeted to non-sedentary Roma (e.g. Austria and France). However, during the evaluation period, the focus of the NRISs on measures in the field of housing has been limited. Many NGOs (31 out of 65) 367 across 15 Member States believe that, in the period 2011-2017, the NRIS of their Member State did not contribute at all to ensuring national funding for Roma integration in the field of housing. The OPC points to similar results: according to 70% to 77% of the respondents, no progress was made in the 2011-2016 period in terms of adopting measures in the field of housing in the countries covered (Figure 7) 368 .

Q15.1: Please mark whether you rather agree, or rather disagree with the following statements referring to measures taken in the field of HOUSING since 2011 in your country. Data on the effectiveness of the measures taken at national level in the field of housing is scarce, as disaggregated information on Roma population is usually not collected. Where information on the effects of the measures adopted has been collected, it points to limited progress. Regarding access of Roma to social housing , several countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Italy, Romania and Serbia have implemented projects to improve access 369 . In Bulgaria , ERDF funded integrated projects in four municipalities aimed to provide modern social housing while also incorporating ESF- funded measures to increase access to employment, education, and healthcare 370 . Of the 684 vulnerable individuals who accessed the scheme, just under half were reportedly Roma people 371 , while the projects were undergoing evaluation at the time of the evaluation. In some regions/municipalities in Italy , existing rules consider living in formal camps as a suitable living condition, rather than as a situation of housing disadvantage that would facilitate the access to social housing. This rule was challenged in the municipality of Rome, where it was recognised that Roma families living in camps should receive a higher \u2018disadvantaged\u2019 score vis-\u00e0-vis those living in formal housing. However, the availability of social housing in Italy remains very limited (5% of the stock) and, despite legislative interventions, no significant improvement in terms of access to social housing 369 CS-BG, CS-FR, CS-IT, CS-RO, CY2.

A similar consideration is valid in relation to Romania . In this Member State, the pilot project \"Social housing for Roma communities\" was included in the NRIS 373 . According to the data provided by the NRCP, 147 apartments were distributed, and 126 dwellings were completed by the end of 2016. Nevertheless, Romania still experiences a serious shortage of social housing (1.4 % of the total stock) compared to the needs, and housing is considered by many national stakeholders as the domain where the least progress has been achieved 374 . In some countries, projects have been developed to improve or maintain the conditions of the camps or to accommodate Roma in other places \u2013 dismantlement of camps and relocation . In France , projects in some cities (e.g. Toulouse, Strasbourg, Lyon) have been successful in rehousing marginalised people from camps. However, looking at the situation at national level, data from 2016 suggest that around 16,000 Roma live in camps 375 and, despite the projects to relocate, this number has not changed since 2014 376 . In 53 camps, the housing situation is very poor (no waste collection in 74% of them, 88% are not connected to the electricity grid and 77% do not have access to tap water 377 ). In Italy , around 45% of all known Roma in cities above 15,000 inhabitants live in segregated camps. The actions implemented at local level (e.g. ranking system to facilitate access to social housing and a regional law in Emilia- Romagna on closing existing encampments and finding housing solutions) have not yet affected the situation or contributed to the closure of camps. 378 In some cases, the measures implemented have produced effects inconsistent with the objectives of the EU Framework. For example, the 2017 OSEPI report 379 notes the \u2018bad practice of using EU funds to provide housing infrastructure that further segregates Roma communities\u2019, which undermines access to public utilities and exacerbates exclusion. The European Court of Auditor Special report mentions the need for (and thus the current lack of) explicitly excluding segregation practices from funding under the ESIF Framework (and not just mentioned in the recitals), particularly in the area of education and housing 380 .

Reports by the Human Rights League suggest that the number of people evicted in France since 2013 has been decreasing, although in 2016 it was still higher compared to 2012 382 . According to other civil society and human right agencies, the situation in France has not improved, and evictions are continuous and, sometimes, violent 383 . In Italy, there have been evictions of informal camps that have not improved living conditions of Roma population. In the absence of alternative housing solutions, according to stakeholders, evictions have mainly resulted in the creation of new informal camps. 384 The majority of OPC respondents considered that there were more forced evictions (53%) of Roma today than there were in 2011. Forced evictions, executed on grounds of safety risks or health hazards, are other example of actions taken at national level that undermine the achievement of the objectives of the EU Framework. Roma people affected by evictions are often not offered with adequate housing solutions (e.g. Italy and France 385 ). The analysis related to the enlargement region shows that housing projects (e.g. in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia) did not have a significant impact, given the scale of the needs, although the expected objectives were achieved 386 . 3.4.1.7 To what extent can changes in discrimination patterns and quantitative and qualitative effects of Roma integration measures in employment, education, housing and healthcare be credited to the EU Framework\"? What other factors have influenced the achievements observed? The observed changes in discrimination and inclusion patterns have been impacted by a number of external factors, including mainstream policy measures that were not linked to the NRIS, Roma-targeted policies pre-dating the NRIS (such as the Roma Decade 387 ), and exogenous economic (e.g. the labour market situation) and social factors (e.g. the \u2018migration crisis\u2019) and political changes. The extent to which the observed effects can be attributed to these external forces, to mainstream policies or to the EU Framework and NRIS is not always clear. Regarding the observed positive changes in discriminatory attitudes, for instance, multiple factors, such as political developments or social development (e.g. the migration crisis) could have influenced public attitudes in ways that are difficult to measure.

It can be only speculated whether the political will generated with the adoption of the EU Framework, and the variety of EU-funded anti-discrimination measures were the main drivers that contributed to the positive developments described in section 3.4.1.1. There were no studies, which attempted to attribute the changes to particular anti-discrimination policy measures. Regardless of whether Member States included anti-discrimination as a key objective in their NRIS (Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Slovakia, Italy, Hungary, Czech or Spain) or did not (France, Greece), most of the anti-discrimination measures that Member States implemented were in response to the EU Framework. In some Member State the legal measures were the result of the Racial Equality Directive 388 , which the EU Framework also promoted. Even though stakeholders especially civil society, appreciated the measures that have been implemented, most of respondents could not attribute the observed changes in the levels of discrimination to these measures or the NRIS. The following reasons were noted: \uf09f The measures were very limited in scope and length 389 . In the Czech Republic for instance, the measures focused on monitoring discrimination but not on fighting it. \uf09f Anti-discrimination bodies in some Member States, have no budget to lead campaigns or implement policies horizontally. 390 They seem disconnected from the NRIS. In Italy, where the anti-discrimination body functions as an NRCP, on the opposite more Roma-focused anti-discrimination activities took place. \uf09f Even in Italy or Spain, where the ambitions in terms of the scale of the projects was much larger than in other Member States, the limited geographic scope, the short-duration of the project, as well as lack of Roma involvement were given as reasons for limited effects 391 . In Italy, these measures included the establishment of Regional Network for the prevention and fight against racial discrimination and of a National Observatory on Discrimination in the Media and the Internet. In Spain they included the measures to prevent and reducing discrimination and hate speech in mass media and the Internet, awareness-raising and training to key stakeholders (legal practitioners, media, police forces, civil servants, etc.); creation of a specialised unit on discrimination and hate crimes within the prosecutor\u2019s office. \uf09f The types of measure that are reported by Member States are not focused on preventing discrimination in the four policy areas, but are rather horizontal \u2013 promoting dialogue with civil society, awareness raising campaigns, training of various officials (but nothing specifically for employers, medical personnel, or school teachers), sensitising Roma on their rights. 392 Therefore, the observed changes in the areas of employment or health cannot be directly linked with any of the measures reported under the NRIS. \uf09f Attributing the changes in access to education, health, employment, and housing to the EU Framework is more nuanced. In respect to housing or employment, the lack of positive quantitative or qualitative effects, as shown in sections 3.4.1.3 and 3.4.1.4, makes it difficult to establish the attribution of the EU Framework, except on the project or policy measure level. In respect to education, the mainstream policies as well as targeted actions clearly brought positive results. Even if not all mainstream measures were in response to the EU Framework, clearly, the Framework contributed to the observed changes. Regarding changes in Roma access to health, there is lack of evidence about the actual health 388 CS-SK, CS-ES. 389 CS-AT, CS-BG, CS-EL, CS-CZ, CS-SK 390 CS-RO, CS-BG 391 CS-IT, CS-ES 392 CS-AT, CS-BG, ",

Education Attributing described changes in sections 3.4.1.1 and 3.4.1.2 effects to mainstream or targeted policy measures, or the NRIS or other strategic policy from our review shows that positive changes can be credited to the EU Framework only to a limited extent . The issues the EU Framework aims to address were known and recognised in the respective countries prior to 2011 393 . Some of the positive developments observed in ECEC, and registered by the EUMIDIS II survey, notably the increased enrolment rates, were the result of mainstream measures, such as lowering the compulsory age for pre- school education \u2013 lowered to 3 years of age in Hungary, and to 5 years in Bulgaria 394 . Positive ECEC changes in Greece, Spain and Slovakia, on the other hand, could be attributed to targeted measures, implemented as a result of the EU Framework 395 . Changes in compulsory education enrolment rates could on one hand be interpreted as a knock-on effect of the increased ECEC rates, while on the other hand they could be the result of targeted measures aimed at encouraging or facilitating school enrolment 396 . Another factor that impacts enrolment rates but is difficult to clearly attribute to the EU Framework is the general level of awareness of Roma of the value of education. In Spain, this change in values has been linked to the increasing number of Roma finish tertiary education and consequently become \u201crole models\u201d in their community 397 . Employment There is insufficient evidence to attribute any changes in Roma access to employment to the EU Framework /NRIS. Moreover, the changes in employment for the Roma population across Member States did not always follow the general trend observed for the general population on the basis of the Eurostat Labour Force Survey (LFS) data and as reported below. 393 For example: CS-ES, CS-IT, BE-3, AT-2 394 CS-BG, CS-HU 395 CS-ES, CS-EL, CS-SK 396 CS-BG, CS-HU, CS-ES, CS-EL, CS-SK 397 CS-ES ",

Accordingly in 2011, the EU average general population employment rate was 68.6% and increased to 71.1% in 2016. Since 2011 the employment rate in most Member States and enlargement countries has remained almost the same or slightly increased, while in some it has decreased. According to Eurostat, in Austria, Spain, Romania, Croatia, Finland and Portugal, employment rates have remained almost the same since 2011, while in Greece the employment rate decreased. On the other hand in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the employment rate increased between 2011 and 2016. 398 At the same time, as the FRA Roma survey shows, the share of Roma with \u2018paid work\u2019 as their main activity status decreased slightly from 26% in 2011 and 25% in 2016, while the same indicator for the general population increased from 70% to 71%, keeping stable the average employment gap between Roma and non-Roma.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 101 The largest employment gaps between Roma and the general population were observed in Croatia and Spain, while in Greece it appears that, in 2016, there was almost no gap, largely due to economic crisis which Greece has experienced. 399 However, the fact that many country analysis studies and European level interviews mention that without the EU Framework for NRIS, Roma integration would have been left out of the political agenda in many Member States and enlargement countries, reveals the usefulness and the importance of an instrument such as the EU Framework, to addressing the specific Roma needs in all policy areas, including employment. Health The body of evidence assessed for this report cannot establish clearly the causal factors that contributed to the improved self-reported health condition of Roma. While several questions in the EUMIDIS2 survey provide information on the 2016 health situation of Roma, these questions were not asked in 2011 and thus it cannot be deduced whether improvements were due to the EU Framework or other factors. As such, very little evidence exists to attribute to the EU Framework / NRIS some or all of the observed the changes in health-related discrimination, improvement in health status and health coverage of the Roma. The OSEPI 400 and Roma Health Report 401 claim that some of the targeted policy initiatives (e.g. health mediators 402 ), implemented as a result of the EU Framework contributed to the positive results in Roma access to healthcare. Stakeholders consulted in the country analysis reports 403 also were of the opinion that health mediators, health support centres or other health awareness campaigns contributed to the positive results observed. This is supported by the Commission\u2019s 2017 Mid-term review which credits the EU Framework for a number of successful health measures 404 . A notable and concrete example was Romania, where an impact evaluation showed a positive correlation between the existence of a Roma health mediators and the health situation and preventive behaviour of Roma communities 405 . Some stakeholders noted that the some key targeted health measures (such as health mediators or mobile health clinics), while part of the NRIS, were introduced before the EU Framework, and thus their impact cannot be attributed to the Framework itself 406 . Other stakeholders noted that mainstream health measures, not part of the NRIS, may have had positive impacts on the Roma 407 . One example is the adoption of Law 4368/2016 by the Ministry of Health in Greece which contributed to increased access to healthcare for all uninsured and vulnerable groups including the Roma 408 .

In Austria , the 2011 NRIS mentioned several health measures which were either already in place or due to be implemented within the year 410 . Lastly, an EU- level interview highlighted vaccination drives in several Member States which have contributed to the vaccination of Roma children in segregated ghettoes 411 . In Slovakia a key project linked to positive health effects was a major EU-funded initiative to improve the water quality of (amongst others) vulnerable populations 412 . Several factors other than the EU Framework may have contributed to the effects and achievements observed. For example, health mediators that were already in place in several Member States prior to the adoption of the EU Framework as well as changes in health coverage level as result of mainstream measures. The Decade of Roma Inclusion promoted awareness-raising, regional initiatives and promoted the introduction of Roma health mediators 413 . Housing In many Member States, although measures in the field of housing had been introduced before the adoption of the EU Framework (e.g. AT, FR, RO, FI 414 ), the EU Framework provided momentum for action and prompted broader policies to address the integration of Roma 415 . In this context, a positive effect of the EU Framework is that of having catalysed attention on this issue at national level and promoted the mobilisation of funding in this area. Housing interventions have often been the weakest part of national strategies 416 . The information reviewed and presented above suggests that limited or no improvement in the field of housing has been recorded between 2011 and 2016. Overall, drawing the link between the policies implemented at national level, their effects and the EU Framework is challenging. Based on the information collected in the context of the country studies , some projects have brought tangible and positive effects (e.g. the projects mentioned above about access to social housing in Bulgaria and Romania; relocation of Roma people in some French municipalities). Nevertheless, the effects achieved are overall marginal and the main issues related to integration of Roma in the field of housing (poor housing conditions, segregation and forced evictions) remain largely unchanged across Europe. On a similar note, in the enlargement region, housing projects \u2018achieved their objectives in terms of providing new or improved housing\u2019 but, as mentioned above, the scale of their effects was relatively insignificant compared to the needs to be addressed 417 . 409 CS-EL; FRA Roma Integration Scoreboard Indicators. 410 CS-AT. 411 EUI-4. 412 CS-SK; 413 EUI-5. 414 CS-FR and CS-AT. 415 CS-FR, CS-AT, CS-IT. 416 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Report on the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies\u2019, COM (2014) 209 final, p7, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/roma_implement_strategies2014_en.pdf 417 EPRD Office for Economic Policy and Regional Development, Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma communities, European Commission, 2015, available at: https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication- detail/-/publication/d2cc11f8-e10a-11e5-8a50-01aa75ed71a1/language-en.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 103 3.4.1.8 To what extent do the effects correspond to the objectives as defined in 2011 and extended by the 2013 Council Recommendation? The response to this questions is integrated in sections 3.4.1.2-3.4.1.4. 3.4.1.9 What other factors have influenced the achievements observed? This response to this question is discussed as part of the section 3.4.1.6. 3.4.1.10 Why were certain objectives not reached? Numerous factors at play since 2011 may have prevented the achievement of the objectives. First of all, as this is a mid-term evaluation, naturally, the objectives can only be achieved to a certain degree. Much of the evidence presented dates to later 2015 / early 2016 when FRA surveys were conducted - a mid-point until 2020. General attitudes and perceptions, as well as behavioural changes deriving from changes to these, take time. One of the main reasons for the non-achievement relates to the level of political commitment , which has been unstable. The \u2018migration crisis\u2019 of 2015 diverted political attention and (financial and human) resources for the integration of newly arrived ethnic minority asylum seekers. The crisis also brought about shift towards negative public attitudes towards migrants (including Roma migrants) 418 . The changing political landscape brought to power governments across the EU, which did not consider minority rights and inclusion a political priority. As a result, some country studies indicated that neither funding nor commitment to implement NRIS were in place (CS-CZ, CS-BG, CS- AT). Discrimination, as shown in section 3.4.1.1 continues to play a significant role, in particular in preventing Roma integration into the labour market, or improvements to the housing situation. The role of discrimination is less of a factor in respect to access to education and health. As the sections below indicate lack of significant changes in capacity of governments to implement Roma inclusions measures, possibly contributed (along with insufficient commitment and funding) to the lack of targeted measures and sufficient consideration of Roma inclusion in mainstream policy areas. Lastly, as Section 3.4.2 below shows, the alignment of many NRIS/ sets of policies with the EU Framework is limited. Education In addition to the above mentioned general factors that have hindered progress in the area of education, segregation remains a specific issue hindering the achievement of inclusion policies 419 . The mid-term evaluation of the Framework indicates that the mutual benefits of mixed classes are still not widely acknowledged and certain Member States are reluctant to put in place effective desegregation measures. Health The evidence points to several reasons to explain why certain health objectives were not reached: 418 Standard Eurobarometer 83, Spring 2015, Public Opinion in the European Union, p. 36, http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_first_en.pdf 419 Midterm review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 104 \uf09f Lack of thematic focus : One factor that could explain why certain objectives may not have been reached, is the absence of a specific health focus in certain NRIS. For instance, the Austrian NRIS excludes health as a thematic focus, but rather includes it as a general objective 420 . \uf09f Lack of funding in the area of health: As indicated in Section 3.6 on Efficiency, healthcare funding has been nearly non-existent, with the exception of a few targeted projects of the ERDF. The NGO Survey shows that, from 2011-2017, 31% of participants felt that their Member State had not contributed at all to ensuring national funding for healthcare, while 63% of respondents felt that their national funding for Roma inclusion in healthcare was not sufficient or proportionate to the needs of the Roma in their respective Member States, and the same percentage felt that the EU funding for Roma inclusion was not reaching Roma beneficiaries. \uf09f Lack of implementation of national legislation/measures : Closely linked to previous factor, it was pointed out during the EU level scoping interviews that laws/measures meant to help Roma are often not implemented in practice, which negatively affects the health of this population group 421 . Examples of this phenomenon related to health are found to occur in several Member States 422 and are reiterated in one of the EU level interviews 423 . Employment As the mid-term review 424 indicates, one reason for the lack of progress could be that measures mostly focussed on the supply side, i.e. employability (through vocational training, lifelong learning, etc.), without proportionately addressing barriers on the demand side, e.g. by monitoring and fighting discrimination, encouraging / incentivising employers to hire Roma, etc. Mainstream measures could also target Roma better. In addition, the low employability of Roma people, due to the lack of education and previous work experience 425 as well as discrimination and existing stereotyping 426 have hindered the narrowing of the employment gap between Roma and the general population. Moreover, among the challenges in employment referred by the NRCPs is the need to impress on employers the importance of diversity management and anti- discrimination. 427 As the policy priority fields are highly dependent on each other, the lack of an integrated approach and cross-sectoral implementation also influenced the effectiveness of the EU Framework as a whole. At European level, interviewee states that without suitable housing, Roma cannot gain access to the labour market, or to healthcare. 428 Similarly, evidence shows that the lack of funding and long-term integrated planning are among the key factors that have hindered the effectiveness in the field of employment. 420 CS-AT. 421 EUI-4, EUI-5, EUI-6, EUI-7. 422 ERRC Thirsting for Justice: Europe\u2019s Roma Denied Access to Clean Water and Sanitation, March 2017: http://www.errc.org/uploads/upload_en/file/thirsting-for-justice-march-2017.pdf 423 EUI-7 424 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final, p. 9 425 CS-RO, CS-AT, CS-ES 426 SK-8, 427 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final, p. 9 428 EUI-8 ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 105 The efficient utilisation of the ESIF 2014-2020, especially by taking the form of multi- funded OPs to support integrated approaches, is likely to contribute to improving effectiveness in this policy area. Other factors that prevented the achievement of the objectives were discrimination and prejudices. The low educational levels, the lack of skills to enter new professions and declining traditional crafts and trade, along with the prejudice and discriminatory practices against Roma are the main factors that increase the risk for more Roma to enter the informal economy, and limit their access to micro-credit initiatives. The limited changes in enrolment or completion tertiary education rates level also contribute to the growing gap between Roma and non-Roma youth NEETs. The lack of employment opportunities is also linked to residential segregation: non-Roma who live in Roma neighbourhoods overall have lower employment rates (31 %) than non-Roma living in majority neighbourhoods (41%). 429 Moreover, Roma employment rates have also been impacted by the economic and financial crisis, limiting their access to the labour market, in particular of youth. 430 On the other hand, Roma benefited from mainstream unemployment and anti-poverty measures (but which are not directly linked to NRIS or EU Framework). 431 Housing Several factors have hindered progress in the area of housing: \uf09f Level of investment needed : Some interviews and country studies highlighted that the lack of focus on housing is a consequence of the costly investment needed in this field (e.g. building social housing; dismantling illegal housing) 432 . Moreover, meeting the current needs would require high investments. An illustration of the mismatch between funding and needs is provided by the evaluation of the IPA Support to Roma Communities in enlargement countries. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the need of housing units for Roma households was estimated at more than 4,000 units; matching the needs would costs around EUR 80 million, whereas the projects implemented under the IPA 2013 provided houses for a total cost of only EUR 3 million 433 . \uf09f Complexity of the investment needed : The lack of focus on housing can also be explained by the complexity of the interventions needed to tackle the issues at hand 434 , including the legalisation of housing and land in settlements (e.g. cadastres, land property titles). \uf09f Public opinion and political will : Improving existing conditions or, especially, providing housing solutions for Roma can be met by a hostile public opinion and prompt anti-Gypsy sentiments, which in part explains also the lack of political will amongst authorities. In Slovakia, the low level of interest from the municipalities was reflected in the low participation to calls for demand-oriented projects financed by the ERDF in 2016 435 . The lack of political commitment is an issue flagged also in several interviews and countries studies 436 . 429 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Poverty and employment: the situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States.

The EU Framework itself, as well as the EPSCO Council , workshop participants and several stakeholders at EU and national level agree that the achievement of the housing objectives requires the adoption of an integrated approach (mainstreaming) in this area as well as with the other areas and other EU and national policies, including social affairs and security, because housing is interlinked with other areas such as legal and social status, and access to stable financial resources 438 . Enlargement countries \u2019 experience confirms that only integrated approaches work 439 . Whereas the literature merely generally stresses the need to pay special attention to the gender dimension when adopting an integration approach to Roma inclusion 440 , the 2015 evaluation on IPA support to Roma communities mentions it specifically in relation to housing in the enlargement countries 441 . The need for a long-term approach to guarantee the continuation of programmes and projects has also been highlighted in general of all policies 442 . 3.4.2 To what extent did the EU Framework contribute to setting up and mobilising the necessary instruments (such as the NRIS and annual reports by Member States, civil society and the Commission) and governance structures at European and national levels (National Roma Contact Points and its network, National Roma Platforms, European Platform for Roma Inclusion, civil society consultation meetings, EU Roma Summits)? The EU Framework was effective in introducing a number of monitoring and consultation instruments as well as a governance structures at EU level (Roma Team at DG JUST, EU Task force, Network of NRCPs, European Platform for Roma Inclusion, NRIS reporting mechanism). These structures and instruments all contributed to improving the coherence and effective implementation of policies. Even though some of them predated the EU Framework (the Roma Task Force was created in 2010, while European Platform for Roma Inclusion met for a first time 2009 443 ), each was strengthened and better grounded, following the adoption of the EU Framework. The effectiveness and issues with these coordination structures in considered in depth in the section on Coordination (3.5) of this report. While 66.7% of OPC respondents recognised that the development of EU coordinating structures was one of the key achievements of the EU Framework, 72.6% also agreed that there was a lack of transparency of these coordinating structures (17.1% are of the opposite opinion). In addition, 65% of respondents agreed that another key challenge at the EU level was the \u2018insufficient structural involvement of NRCPs\u2019. 437 AT-4; HR-3; PT-2. 438 EPSCO Decision Recommendations of 9 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States, OJ C 378.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 107 The monitoring of the results of the EU Framework has developed slowly and with a significant delay following the introduction of the latter. Comprehensive reports by Member States were introduced four years after the adoption of the EU Framework in 2015. These reports are not structured to monitor progress to achieving the objectives of NRIS, but rather to report on ongoing policy measures by Member States. Independent monitoring continues to be partial in its coverage of Member States and depth of information collected. FRA\u2019s 2011 Roma Survey and 2016 EU-MIDIS II Survey that allow EC to develop monitoring \u2018scoreboard\u2019 of indicators, covered 11 Member States but only nine of them were covered in both 2011 and 2016, thus limiting the opportunity to monitor results. This will be partially improved after 2018, when six additional Member States will be included in the survey. The indicators themselves are not entirely designed to evaluate the objectives or the policies, neither are they fully aligned (which would allow comparison with general population data) with tools used by Eurostat or Eurobarometer, which measures different social policies or attitudes. In 2017, DG Justice piloted a project to monitor the implementation of the NRIS by civil society in all EU Member States, except Malta 444 . At the time of the completion of the present report five monitoring reports had been produced 445 . National Level At the national level, the EU Framework led to the development of two key instruments: the adoption of NRIS or sets of policies and the establishment of NRCPs (see table below). The majority of Member States that adopted NRIS or sets of policies did so in response to the EU Framework. Sweden is the only Member State that indicated that its NRIS was adopted after 2011 but not in response to the EU Framework, as the development of the NRIS had started before 2011. 446 As of 2016, all enlargement countries had adopted NRIS and action plans and had also put in place NRCPs and national Roma Platform structures 447 . The establishment and / or further development of NRIS implementation reports, coordination mechanisms, and civil society consultation mechanisms can be attributed only to a certain extent to EU Framework. Many Member States stated that the national implementation reports of the NRIS to their national governments or Parliaments were part of their \u2018normal\u2019 policy processes and would have been introduced regardless of the EU Framework.

In addition, enlargement countries were only partially covered by interviews. OPC respondents to a large extent recognise the more limited role of the EU Framework on governance and coordination structures at Member State level. The majority of respondents do not recognise as a main achievement either the NRPCs nominated to oversee the implementation of NRIS (53.8%), or the setting up of cooperation structures at national level (59%), or national NRIS implementation reports (61.5%). 3.4.2.1 Has the EU Framework served as a Framework for NRIS? The EU Framework has served only in a limited way as Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies: in both their national strategies and other policy documents, the majority of Member States in fact adopted objectives and measures that were formulated differently (either too generally or entirely differently) from the objectives and measures formulated by the EU Framework and the Council Recommendation (a mapping of the results from the analysis of NRIS is available in Annex 6 to this report). Seventeen Member States 451 have adopted NRIS, the remaining ten Member States 452 have adopted sets of policy documents. The reasons provided by Member States for not having developed strategies are: \uf09f The small size of the Roma population 453 \uf09f The legal impediments to adopting a strategy that targets one specific ethnic group 454 . \uf09f Some Member States stated that there was insufficient evidence of discrimination against Roma and therefore a strategy was not needed 455 . While the adoption of a strategy demonstrates a higher level of political commitment and ambition than a strategic policy document, both types of policymaking could stimulate the implementation of inclusion policies. Therefore, the remaining analysis does not differentiate between countries with strategies and those with policies. The analysis of strategic documents and interviews with NRCPs show that Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Finland have aligned the objectives of their NRIS. Belgium and Croatia have partially aligned their NRIS only in respect to education and employment. The remaining MS either have not aligned their objectives at all, or have aligned only one objective (see Table 23 below). Reasons for not aligning strategies / sets of policies include: \uf09f Member States do not consider that additional efforts for Roma inclusion are needed.

OPC respondents seem to have a more positive view of the EU Framework, possibly because the majority of respondents were from Member States in which strategies were more closely aligned. A total of 71% of respondents stated that one of the main achievements of the EU Framework had been that \u2018all Member States have developed integrated strategies and policies\u2019. Eighteen percent of the respondents disagreed, while 11% had no opinion. The table in Annex 4 provides an overview of the alignment of national strategic documents in relation to the EU Framework objectives or specific guidance. 3.4.2.2 What have been the major challenges in the effective functioning and/or interaction of these structures? These response to this question is provided in detail in the section on Coordination (Section 3.5.1). 3.4.3 To what extent did National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) lead to effective Roma integration measures and inclusive reform of mainstream policies? The issue of effects of the Roma integration measures is discussed in sections 3.4.1.2- 3.4.1.5. The issue of mainstreaming of Roma integration is discussed in the section 3.3.1.1 (Coherence). 3.4.3.1 To what extent did they contribute to increased European and national funding for Roma integration and inclusive reforms? The adoption of the EU Framework and NRIS contributed overall to increased funding for Roma integration policy measures in the European Union. This increase is however mainly due to EU funding rather than national funds. Neither the publicly available data nor any of the interviewees could provide sufficient evidence to estimate by how much the funding has changed following the adoption of the EU Framework and NRIS. Yet, there are number of indicators that allow to draw the overall conclusion that the Member States in which the majority of EU Roma reside have allocated more funds in some of the policy areas. Interviewees from Member States where Roma inclusion is approached only via a \u2018mainstream approach\u2019 and which do not collect statistics on ethnicity of target groups could not provide any information either on national or EU funding (Germany, France, Luxembourg, Netherland, United Kingdom, Denmark).

Information prior to 2011, is only available in some of the Member States, which implemented activities in the context of the Roma Decade (2005 \u2013 2015) or of their pre-existing Roma inclusion strategies. 481 BE-1, BG-1, FI-1, PT-1 The Croat NRCP could not provide comparative data, but indicated that the annual reports of the National Roma Program (2003-2012) provide such evidence (HR-4). Other government respondents also provided evidence that investment in employment inclusion measures for Roma increased steadily from around EUR1 million 2011 to EUR2 million in 2018. (HR-1) ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 113 specific level of increase, the fact that prior to 2011 there were no NRIS logically meant that less funds must have been spent on Roma inclusion. 482 One of the key arguments where respondents seem to have different views concerns national co-financing. Government officials mostly argue that the increased levels of funding through the ESF should not be seen simply an increase in EU funding, because the national co-financing, which within the ESF ranges between 20% and 50%, also had to be increased in absolute terms and supplementary activities to EU funded projects were undertaken. 483 Others argued that there was some increase but this was in part due to the low base of comparison, considering that in 2009 several Member States introduced austerity measures which included budget cuts to Roma inclusion programmes 484 . Finally, some respondents also pointed at other sources of funding besides EU and national, such as the cooperation mechanisms with Switzerland and Norway 485 , have also been used for the NRIS implementation. In 13 Member States, consensus from the in-depth interviews was that there had been no increase in national funding. 486 OPC respondents held similar views: 52% stated that the EU Framework had not contributed to (increased) allocation of national funding for Roma inclusion, while 37.6% are in the opposite opinion. Similarly, 52.1% of OPC respondents disagreed that the EU Framework had resulted in their countries to higher allocations of national funds to fight discrimination / stereotyping and promoting discrimination, while 37.6% of the OPC respondents were of the opposite opinion. 487 The NGO survey responses were more nuanced. In respect to education, 50% were of the opinion that their country\u2019s NRIS contributed \u2018to some extent\u2019 to ensuring national funding, while 13% stated that there had been a \u2018significant contribution\u2019. In respect to health, 52% and 7% respectively expressed similar opinion. In respect to housing (54%), employment (43%), and equality and anti-discrimination (43%) respondents were in the opinion that there the NRIS has had no contribution at all. Regional and Local respondents held similar views to respondents at national level. Some argued that municipal co-financing of EU projects should be accounted for when assessing the changes in EU funding (CZ-7). Others local representatives explained that municipalities had no funding on their own for inclusion measures, and relied primarily on central government but this was very limited or entirely absent. 488 In the enlargement region , respondents argued that prior to the financial crisis, budgets for Roma inclusion were generally on the rise, except in Turkey and Kosovo. When the crisis happened, it provoked a drop in the budgets in most countries in the region, that neither the Roma Decade nor the EU Framework reversed 489 . In Bosnia and Herzegovina funding has decreased after 2011 490 . One notable exception was the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the respondent indicated that no funds were allocated prior to 2011, in comparison EUR 600 000 allocated for housing. 491 482 PT-3 483 AT-3, CZ-7.

In enlargement countries , all respondents expressed a similar view of the impact of IPA funding (see Efficiency section on actual IPA spending). In seven Member States 493 , there was consensus that there had not been any increase, while in another eight Member States 494 , government officials interviewed did not know if and how funding had changed. The majority of OPC respondents (53.5%) equally agreed that the EU Framework had contributed to an (increased) allocation of EU funding under ESIF (2014-2020) for Roma inclusion, yet 29.1% of the respondents were of an opposite opinion. This contrasts with the views expressed on the impact of the EU Framework on funding for inclusive reforms of mainstream policies under ESIF (2014-2020), where more respondents disagreed that there had been any effect (42.7%), than those that agreed (39.3%). 495 Some Member States seem to report decrease in the amount spent. For instance, PL indicated that EUR20 million was spent under the OP Human Capital (OP HC) 2007\u2013 2014, while under the OP Knowledge Education Development 2014\u20132020, the amount EUR10 million. 3.4.3.2 To what extent did the number of Roma beneficiaries of integration measures increase? The available data does not allow for a conclusive answer at the EU level. Government respondents (NRPCs and other government representatives) from a majority of Member States (14) had no data or any evidence, and could not answer the question about changes in the number of Roma beneficiaries 496 . Interviewees in nine Member States argued that the increase number of beneficiaries was a logical outcome of the increased EU funding levels as well as the implementation of the NRIS. 497 In another four Member States, consensus amongst all interviewees was that there had not been any change 498 . Neither government representatives interviewed nor publicly available sources can provide evidence of the actual number of Roma beneficiaries that have increased or decreased in comparison to the period prior to 2011. In Member States where Roma integration is pursued only via a \u2018mainstream approach\u2019 and where statistics on ethnicity of target groups are not available, no information was available either on the number of Roma beneficiaries of inclusion measures 499 . Some Member States claimed that the increased number has come from EU funded projects 500 while others claimed that it came due to mainstream measures 501 .

Therefore the expectation is that by 2020, the number will be greater. 504 \uf09f Difficulty in reaching or retaining beneficiaries in certain measures 505 Interviewees were generally not able to provide qualitative information, about priority areas where more Roma beneficiaries may have been reached. Some respondents argued that not only the number but also the type of beneficiaries reached is important: measures are reaching more vulnerable groups such as the mobile or migrant Roma population, which had not been reached before 506 . A number of Member States are in the process of setting up various monitoring mechanisms that should allow them in the future to monitor the number Roma beneficiaries reached. 507 Nevertheless, these would still not allow to estimate any changes in comparison to periods prior to the monitoring mechanism\u2019s introduction. 3.4.3.3 To what extent did cooperation between stakeholders of Roma integration improve? This question is answered under the Coordination criteria, Section 3.5.2 and 3.5.3. 3.4.4 To what extent did national/local/civil capacity to implement Roma integration measures improve? Today there is better understanding of Roma issues, in particular at the central government level and overall awareness and competences with regard to Roma inclusion, at various levels of government, have expanded. The NRCPs, however, have limited weight to truly connect with line Ministries in order to mainstream Roma issues and influence key sector policies to be receptive of the inclusion of the Roma. Understanding at the local level is still very fragmented and largely linked to availability of funding. Stakeholders provided the following arguments that explain why and how understanding has expanded: \uf09f Understanding expanded to including of more issues (e.g. mobile / migrant Roma 508 . \uf09f The adoption NRIS resulted at the central level increased awareness and knowledge of Roma inclusion 509 .

Political changes at the local level also changes local policy priorities, shifting the focus away of Roma issues compared to previous periods (eg. Flanders). 514 . \uf09f Closer engagement with Roma stakeholders either at the local level or the central level, including via formal Roma platform structures, has helped increase understanding of Roma issues amongst government officials. 515 NGO representatives have been more careful with their assessments, with some arguing that \u2018awareness\u2019 and \u2018understanding\u2019 has not translated into action. 516 They also argued that in policy areas where very little policy activity has taken place (e.g. health or housing) there has been no change. 517 Others added that even though amongst some officials the understanding was better, the vast majority of officials remained ignorant and largely prejudiced. 518 In terms of political leadership, there have been many changes since the adoption of the NRIS, which means that knowledge and commitment at the political level, both centrally and at the local level, fluctuates 519 . It is often difficult to differentiate between political \u2018speak\u2019 and actual commitment and understanding of the issues 520 . Domestically, showing commitment in Member States is not well accepted by the general population, as it leaves them with the understanding that there is preferential treatment of the Roma 521 . The increased funding levels has also helped, as EU or nationally funded projects have provided local governments with an opportunity to work on solutions and build capacity to develop further projects. Examples were provided on municipalities working on integrated ERDF/ESF funded projects 522 , nationally funded projects, or other pilot projects The establishment of a reporting and coordination process that engages local or regional government officials has pushed them into increasing their understanding. 523 Proactive measures by the central government have also contributed to increased capacity at the local level \u2013 e.g. in Denmark central authorities have distributed relevant EU and national policy documents and examples of best practices, and hold regular meetings with representatives of municipalities, to discuss integration measures. 524 511 BE, AT-9, EUI-1, HR-3 512 SK-12 513 BE-2, BE-5 514 BE-2 515 AT-6, PT-1, UK-5 516 FI-10, FI-13. 517 (LT-3, LT-4). 518 (SK-14). 519519 (BE-1) 520 (BG-7) 521 (EUI-4, EUI-6) 522 BG-10, LT-1, SE-1,PL-1 523 DE-3 524 DK-1 ",

Regarding the number of people specifically dedicated to Roma issues, the predominant opinion is that this has not changed since adopting the NRIS. Wherever respondents mentioned an increase, it is usually by a single person, or they could not give a concrete number. The only significant increase was noted in Finland \u2013 four people were recruited to the NRCP, but that happened in 2006, prior to the adoption of the EU Framework. The Bulgarian case is the only one which shows a decrease in capacity. The NRCP used to have 15 members, but since 2009 it was restructured and ultimately the staff was reduced to only 4 people. Spain and Croatia provide conflicting data: the Croatian NRCP reports and increase in capacity, while the Equality body does not know of any people actually dedicated to dealing with Roma issues. In the Spanish case, when asked whether there was an increase in numbers, different respondents either mentioned that at the local level there was an increase, no change, or no people dedicated at all. 12 Member States declared there was no change 525 , nine Member States 526 reported an increase in capacity and one reported decrease 527 . In the case of Austria, Spain, Finland and Lithuania, the NRCPs reports increase in capacity, while the local NGOs, independent experts and local government were in the opinion that there had been no change. Some respondents noted austerity measures that affected precisely positions linked to human rights and inclusion in some local governments 528 . 3.5 Coordination Key findings Several mechanisms for coordination have been established at EU and national levels, i.e. the European Roma Platform, the EU Roma Summits, the EU Roma Network and consultation meetings with CSOs, the National Roma Platforms. At EU level, overall, coordination mechanisms are considered effective in supporting the dialogue among different Directorates General of the Commission (the Roma Task Force), among NRCPs and between NRCPs and the EC (the Network of NRCPs), and between the Commission, civil society and other stakeholders (consultation meetings in Brussels). The analysis points to a need for strengthening internal coordination within the EC and between EU policies. At national level, the establishment of NRCPs has represented a positive step and has led to improvements in the cooperation among institutions and stakeholders. However, given their mandate and power, the NRCPs only have a limited influence on the design and implementation of mainstream policies and, more generally, on policies implemented by other institutions at the national and local level. Participation of stakeholders (including Roma representatives and CSOs) has been boosted by the introduction of the EU Roma Framework, but weaknesses remain, especially at national level. The involvement of CSOs remain limited in the practical implementation of the NRIS, as well as in the monitoring and evaluation processes. 525 AT; CY; DK; EE; ES; FI; FR; LT; LU; NL; PT; SI 526 AT; BE; DE; ES; FI; HR; LT; PL; SE 527 BG 528 UK-1 ",

This criterion covers two main dimensions: \uf09f The first dimension refers to the inter-governmental coordination established at EU and national level, and at horizontal (i.e. among Commission services at EU level, and ministries at national level) and vertical level (e.g. between national and local authorities). This dimension is discussed in paragraph 3.5.1and analysed across the different stages of the policy cycle (planning, funding, implementation and monitoring and evaluation). \uf09f The second dimension refers to the involvement of stakeholders and civil society, both at EU and national level, in implementation, planning and monitoring (paragraph3.5.2), as well as the involvement of Roma representatives (paragraph 3.5.3). Most of the coordination mechanisms established at EU and national level cover both these dimensions. However, to avoid repetitions across the evaluation questions, the two issues are presented separately. Moreover, this criterion assesses the actions taken for ensuring communication about the EU Roma Framework (paragraph 3.5.4), and the administrative capacity of the coordination structures established at both EU and national level (paragraph 3.5.5). 3.5.1 Have coordination mechanisms at EU/National level been effective in coordinating the policy making, funding, implementation, monitoring and evaluation)? EU level At EU level, several mechanisms have been set to ensure intergovernmental coordination across the different stages of the policy cycle: among different DGs (the Roma Task Force), among NRCPs and between NRCPs and the EC (the Network of NRCPs), between NRCPs and managing authorities of Funds (EU Roma network). In addition, the Roma Team in the \"Non-discrimination and Roma coordination unit\" of DG JUST leads the implementation and coordination of the Roma Framework at the EU level. DG NEAR leads the implementation and coordination of the Roma Framework at the EU level in the enlargement region (see also paragraph 3.5.2). Box 1 presents an overview.

European Network on Social Inclusion and Roma under the Structural Funds ( EU Roma Network ): a learning network focussed on the use of ESI Funds for the inclusion of Roma which includes NRCP and managing authorities 531 . Annual reporting : Member States have to submit to the Commission an annual report on the implementation of the NRISs 532 . This reporting obligation is expected to improve coordination and strengthen the development of the monitoring system. In general terms, these mechanisms represent a permanent system of cooperation , which has led to a better alignment of initiatives, increased knowledge sharing and the concentration of economic resources. During the workshop , several NGOs have highlighted the establishment of stronger cooperation between all relevant stakeholders, as result of the EU Roma Framework, and have acknowledged the role of the EC to achieve it. Nevertheless, there are limitations with respect to the effectiveness of each mechanism in ensuring actual coordination, and differences across stages (i.e. policy-making, funding, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation). At policy-making and implementation level, the Roma Task Force is an important instrument to facilitate the integration of Roma inclusion into different policy fields and maximise the potential impact. Nevertheless, many stakeholders have argued that internal coordination within the Commission and between EU policies could be further strengthened . Several interviews at EU level 533 and stakeholders who participated in the workshop suggest that internal coordination in the European Commission has not been strong enough, and Roma inclusion issues have not been sufficiently integrated in all relevant EU policies notably in education, employment, social inclusion, and justice. The network of NRCPs is considered by the NRCPs interviewed as a good opportunity to establishing contacts with colleagues of other Member States dealing with 529 Other DGs \u2013 e.g. SG, BUDG, RTD, ECFIN, COM \u2013 are part of the \u201cExtended Taskforce\u201d, which meets less frequently.

Needs for improvement only concern specific aspects; for example, one NRCP has suggested the need to boost more practical interaction during the meetings. Looking at general coordination mechanisms at EU level, many NRCPs interviewed have provided a positive opinion 535 . Some of them, however, have pointed at the need for simplification (e.g. online tools for the exchange of documents among NRCPs; simplification of the coordination mechanisms and bodies) or increased complementarity between European Commission\u2019s units 536 . Regarding funding , some stakeholders highlighted the lack of effective coordination within the European Commission with respect to funding instruments and the need for better links between EU political and financial priorities and the EU Roma Framework 537 . However, specific initiatives have promoted the better use of ESIF for the inclusion of Roma. They include: the EU Roma Network (made up of NRCPs and managing authorities in 15 Member States) that has continued to promote the use of the ESF for Roma integration 538 ; the ESF Roma Inclusion Learning Network, funded by the EC 539 to further promote exchange and cooperation between the ESF managing authorities on this topic. Moreover, the introduction of ex-ante conditionalities linked with Roma integration 540 has certainly represented a step forward in the coordination between the EU Roma Framework and the EU funding. Finally, monitoring and evaluation has been identified as a weak point of the EU Roma Framework. At EU level, the introduction of the annual reporting strengthened the development of a \u2018European system of monitoring\u2019. However, these reports do not allow for monitoring and evaluate of progress made towards the objectives of NRIS, and a robust monitoring and evaluation system, including the results achieved through different funding instruments, seem to be still missing 541 . National level At national level, the main coordination mechanism is represented by the NRCPs , which hold the mandate to coordinate the development and implementation of the NRISs. In practical terms, NRCPs are expected to ensure coordination among the different institutions that, at national and local level, are in charge of relevant policies (in the field of education, health, housing, employment, etc.). Their role extends across the whole policy cycle. The National Roma Platforms represent another mechanism, 534 AT1, BE5, DE3, LU1, LV1, NL6. 535 16 NRCPs (based on the answer to the interview question \u2018Have coordination mechanisms at EU level been effectives in coordinating the policy making, funding, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the EU Framework and NRIS?\u2019). 536 Three NRCPs.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 121 aimed to ensure involvement of and coordination with all relevant stakeholders, and are discussed in paragraph 3.5.2 542 . As acknowledged by the participants in the workshop , the establishment of NRCPs represented a positive step : it provided specific bodies at national level with the mandate to coordinate all activities on Roma inclusion. Interviews with stakeholders suggest that national coordination mechanisms work well in several Member States (e.g. CY, EE, LU, LT, LV, IE, NL, PL, PT, SE, SI, UK), despite there is room for improvement 543 . In these cases, stakeholders point to a good cooperation established between the different institutions and stakeholders in the Member State, in some cases facilitated by the small size of the country. A substantial shortcoming is represented by the mandate and powers of the NRCPs , which have only limited influence on the design and implementation of mainstream policies and, more generally, on policies implemented by other institutions at the national and local level . This shortcoming has been flagged by a number of studies 544 and participants in the workshop . Interviews in several countries and the country studies reports (BE, DE, HR, RO, HU) suggest that NRCPs have limited power in influencing decision-making processes across sectorial policies, and this represents a major obstacle in ensuring a coordinated implementation of NRIS. In other cases, insufficient coordination seems to be the result of a lack of commitment among Ministries (e.g. SI), lack of coordination structures and of participation at local and regional levels (e.g. ES) 545 . The participation of institutions at local and regional level in the development and implementation of NRISs is also hindered by their limited administrative capacity 546 . The political context is another factor that can affect the role attributed to NRCPs and the effectiveness of its coordination capacity. For example, the Bulgarian country study shows that, along with the rise of political actors pursuing an \u2018anti-integration agenda\u2019, the role of the NRCPs has shifted: from a \u2018point of political dialogue\u2019 to a body for technical management of Roma focused projects. The political context and diminished role of the NRCPs has undermined the cooperation between national, regional and local public authorities and the civil society 547 . Intergovernmental coordination at national level is also important to ensure that Roma inclusion is included among the activities to be funded 548 . The EU Roma Network (mentioned above) represents a relevant instrument to this purpose, and it has also guided the integration of sub-national administrative levels, both regional and 542 Next to these main structures, each Member State have implemented specific mechanisms, depending on the national administrative and institutional structure. In this regard, country studies reports provide a more detailed analysis. 543 CY1; EE2; IE2, IE5; LT1; LU1; LV1; NL5; PL1; PT1, PT3; SE1, SE2, SE4; SI3; UK1, UK5. 544 Open Society European Policy Institute, 2017, Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future; European Parliament, 2017, Report on fundamental rights aspects in Roma integration in the EU: fighting anti-Gypsyism; CEPS, 2017, Combating Institutional Anti- Gypsyism responses and promising practices in the EU and selected Member States. 545 BE4, DE1, DE2, DE3, HR2; CS-RO, CS-HU, CS-SI, CS-ES. 546 In 2015, the Commission pointed to the need for increased resources and capacity-building in order to augment the implementation capability of local authorities.

However, this Network only covers 15 Member States, and the 2016 Commission\u2019s report highlighted that better coordination continues to be necessary between NRCPs and the managing authorities for ESIFs . In 2016, the Network of NRCPs was set up also in the enlargement region , supported by the \u2018Roma Integration 2020\u2019 (RI2020) project, implemented by the RCC with the financial support of the European Union (under IPA II) and the OSF 550 . Interviews suggest that the effective setting up of these bodies is still a work in progress; also in this case, the adequacy of the mandate of NRCPs, and their subsequent capacity to influence implementation of relevant policies, has been questioned by one stakeholder 551 . 3.5.2 To what extent effective methods of coordination of the implementation engage the relevant stakeholders? / The extent of participation of civil society, in planning and monitoring inclusion policies and programmes The Framework has enhanced a participatory approach , by boosting the involvement of different stakeholders , including local authorities, NGOs/CSOs, Roma representatives and international institutions or organisations (Council of Europe, UN Agencies or OSCE). In addition to the coordination mechanisms discussed in the previous paragraph, several new instruments for the participation of stakeholders have been established at EU and national level, notably: \uf09f The EU Roma Summit and the European Platform of Roma Inclusion (both gathering national governments, the EU, international organisations and civil society representatives), and annual consultation meetings between the EC and CSOs , at EU level; \uf09f The National Roma Platforms , at national level, and other mechanisms varying depending on the country. During the evaluation period, further efforts have been made to better integrate stakeholders into the implementation of the Framework and the NRIS and to improve cooperation and coordination with relevant stakeholders. Examples of actions taken both in the EU and enlargement region include: projects aimed at strengthening the capacity of local authorities (e.g. ROMACT, ROMACTED, EUROCITIES Roma Taskforce, URBACT II Roma-NET or ROMA-MATRIX); the EC support to Member States in the development of National Roma Platforms 552 , which are also present in the enlargement region since 2017 (called Public Dialogue Forums) 553 ; a reform, carried out in 2015, of the European Platform of Roma Inclusion with the aim of ensuring a more participatory process 554 . These mechanisms have boosted general stakeholder participation .

Moreover, the different coordination mechanisms have been subject to specific criticism, as discussed in the next paragraphs. EU level At EU level, the European Platform for Roma inclusion, the EU Roma Summits and the two consultation meetings with stakeholders have being criticised for lack of transparency and of effective interaction with CSOs and other stakeholders working on the ground. The European Platform for Roma Inclusion was reformed in 2015, after being criticised 555 . Some criticisms have been raised in relation to the EU Roma Summits , and the two consultation meetings that the Commission holds in Brussels every year with CSOs and other stakeholders, with the objective of informing these bodies of policy progress 556 . Regarding the consultation meetings, while the organisations involved value these meetings, it has been argued that there is limited room for interaction and that participation is limited to those NGOs based in Brussels working in the EU field 557 . A few stakeholders consulted during the study have criticised also the lack of information on the Roma Task Force 558 and the Network of NRCPs 559 . Finally, according to an independent evaluation commissioned by the EP and stakeholders consulted by the EC for the midterm review, there was room for improvement of coordination with international organisations (CoE, UN agencies) in order to build \u201con existing capacities, research and experience of policy advocacy\u201d 560 . National level Following the introduction of the EU Roma Framework, most of the countries have introduced new mechanisms for cooperation, coordination, or consultation within government or with other stakeholders (NGOs/CSOs, Roma representatives). In some countries existing mechanisms have been used, or the introduction of new mechanisms is foreseen, but not implemented yet 561 . Where new mechanisms have been introduced, they are very diverse and include: National Roma Platforms 562 , preparation of the yearly national progress reports shared with the relevant stakeholders and dedicated advisory Committees 563 , projects aimed to further strengthen cooperation with Roma CSOs and institutions 564 , steering groups bringing together all the relevant Government 565 , regular consultations/ meetings with 555 EUI2. The 2017 OSEPI report, however, has criticised also the reformed platform for the lack of proper interaction with civil society, as well as its \u2018disconnection from national and local realities\u2019 (Open Society European Policy Institute, 2017, Revisiting the EU Roma framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future). 556 The report the meeting hold on 31 January 2017 can be accessed in the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=42932 557 Open Society European Policy Institute, 2017, Revisiting the EU Roma framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future. 558 EUI2, EUI3. 559 WB-4 (Albania). 560 European Parliament, 2015, Evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies; European Commission, 2017, Mid-term review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies, COM(2017) 458 final, p. 13. 561 See Effectiveness, paragraph 3.4.2. 562 CY1 and LV1. 563 DE3. 564 EE2. 565 IE2.

Looking at the results of these mechanisms in terms of participation , the good level of involvement of relevant stakeholders (including of Roma representatives) was especially acknowledged by NRCPs and other public institutions 568 interviewed , but also by some NGOs 569 . Improvements on stakeholder participation was pointed out in some countries, for instance, in Cyprus, Germany, Ireland, Slovenia or Sweden 570 . Moreover, according to the results of the NGOs survey , many organisations (53.8% or 35) are involved in mechanisms for coordination, implementation, or monitoring of the NRIS. However, most of the NGOs involved in the survey support the opinion that the existing mechanisms for coordination and implementation of the NRIS do not allow for effective cooperation and / or consultation with all key stakeholders 571 . On the one hand, the weak position of the NRCPs and the capacity to involve stakeholders (see paragraph 3.5.1) hinder the effective engagement of CSOs. On the other hand, the lack of involvement of relevant stakeholders in the design and implementation of the NRIS has been highlighted in several countries by interviewees 572 . Additionally, little information is available on the National Roma Platforms 573 . The quality of participation methods also varies. In some cases, it is reported that the Strategy includes different modes of participation, but results are not sure in practice , sometimes due to the lack of political and administrative support 574 , or because consultations occur but they are not taken into account 575 . A need for a \u201cmore pragmatic action on joint projects and initiatives\u201d has been raised also by participants during the workshop . Involvement in the planning and monitoring of EU funding for Roma inclusion has been also reported as limited. According to the EU Roma Network and ERIO, despite the progress on the involvement of relevant stakeholders (including Roma communities) in planning and implementation of EU funds, the extent to which stakeholders for Roma inclusion (NGOs, Roma representatives, CSOs) are involved in the ESIF cycle, in practice, is unclear.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 125 processes for involvement are weak (e.g. informal)\u2019 or limited to specific phases of the policy cycle 576 . Already earlier, several reports had highlighted issues related to involvement of stakeholders. In 2013, the European Roma Policy Coalition (ERPC) considered that the NRIS consultation processes were often inaccessible to all stakeholders, including Roma CSOs, or the impact of their collaboration was minimal 577 . In 2016, the EC highlighted that there was a need for further improvements in the area of cooperation with local authorities, civil society and the private sector . The involvement of the private sector seemed to have been particularly weak, although there are examples of some initiatives (such as INTEGROM in Hungary) 578 . Finally, regarding monitoring and implementation , it is not clear to what extent the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms at national level are based on participatory processes. The 2017 OSEPI report mentions an \u2018emphasis on self-reporting by member states\u2019, which is \u2018inherently flawed\u2019 579 . As mentioned under effectiveness (section 3.4.2), in 2017 DG Justice launched a pilot project on the monitoring of the implementation of NRIS through civil society monitoring. 3.5.3 What is the level of dialogue and cooperation with Roma representatives? The EU Framework considers Roma civil society representatives as relevant stakeholders to play a role both at EU and national level. The interaction with Roma representatives has improved since the establishment of the Framework, especially regarding some policies (education). However, the coordination mechanisms introduced are sometimes superficial and Roma\u2019s views and opinions are not effectively represented, or they are in a limited way. The participation of Roma in the elaboration of the national strategies facilitated the engagement of Roma communities in the implementation 580 and the achievement of tangible results. For instance, a participant to the workshop pointed out that positive changes in the field of education can be explained by the involvement of many Roma in this policy area. In this sense, cooperation with Roma representatives is an integral part of the EU Roma Framework. Different mechanisms support the establishment of such a cooperation at EU and national level (EU Roma Summit, European Platform of Roma Inclusion, Consultation meetings with CSOs, National Roma Platforms). Roma representatives have engaged in discussions and consultations and have influenced reports and the agenda. The Commission has been encouraging greater participation and, consequently, their involvement has been seen as a progress. Some country studies confirm this view. Involvement of Roma representatives in Spain is reported as satisfying and, in Italy, it has recently improved. Similarly, as mentioned in the 576 EURoma, 2016, Promoting the use of ESI Funds for Roma Inclusion. 577 Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edez, C. & S\u00e1nchez-Rubio, B., 2014, ERPC\u2019s Assessment of National Roma integration Strategies: 2012 Report and Recent Developments, Roma Rights 2013: National Roma Integration Strategies: What Next? 578 European Commission, 2016, Report assessing the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the Council Recommendation on Effective Roma integration measures in the Member States in 2016, COM(2016) 424, 27 June 2016. 579 Open Society European Policy Institute, 2017, Revisiting the EU Roma framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future. 580 European Roma Rights Centre, 2013, National Roma Integration Strategies: What next?, Roma Rights \u2013 Journal of the European Roma Rights Centre, p. 13.

However, some interviewees also highlight the limited participation of Roma representatives in general in EU and/or at national level 582 . A majority of OPC respondents consider relevant or rather relevant the lack of Roma participation in developing Roma inclusion policies and consider this as an important factor contributing to Roma exclusion. Similarly, several participants to the workshop (International Organisation; NGO \u2013 Open Society Foundations) underlined that Roma are not involved enough. Civil society reports have highlighted the limitations of the existing approaches to Roma participation . One of the issues raised is the lack of transparency towards Roma representatives and the lack of effective interaction with them. It is suggested that there has been a formalisation of the Roma participation, but that it is still superficial and often symbolic 583 . This occurs at EU level, for instance, regarding interaction with the EC through the Roma Taskforce 584 . At national level, for example, ENAR pointed to the non-existence or insufficient transparency of the implementation of mechanisms foreseen in national strategies 585 . Some interviewees and country reports highlight issues in terms of lack of or limited participation of Roma representatives in consultation processes, in the preparation and implementation of the NRIS, involvement in the National Roma Platform, in funding decisions, or at regional or local level 586 . It has also been pointed out that the Roma communities are not effectively represented by the \u2018official\u2019 Roma representatives. In this regard, the ERRC, in 2013, argued that the Commission\u2019s idea of developing policies and strategies in close cooperation with the Roma civil society is skewed by the unsuccessful \u201cattempts to achieve empowerment, which are being frustrated by the \u2018NGO-isation\u2019, i.e. community groups become distant from the grass roots because of excessive bureaucracy or donor- driven agendas\u201d 587 . The creation of mechanisms involving a closed circle of elite organisations has been highlighted also by an interviewee at EU level, as an issue that prevents the engagement of all relevant 588 . The Spanish country report also argues that there is a need for the inclusion of a more diverse group of Roma representatives. Some sources consider that this situation of limited effective representation of Roma communities is due to the lack of available funding for activities such as \u2018advocacy, watchdog work, civil monitoring, community empowerment and activism\u2019 589 . Different interviewees have suggested initiatives to improve the involvement of Roma representatives: the creation of a permanent Roma consultation structure at EU level with sufficient resources and an independent consultation group composed of Roma civil 581 DE3, EE2, HR4, LT1, LV1, NL2, NL6, PL1, PT1, PT3, SE2, SI3, UK5, WB-2 (Serbia), WB3 (Regional Coordination Council), WB 5 (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), WB8 (Bosnia and Herzegovina), WB11 (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), DE2, HR3, LT2, PT2, WB 4 (Albania). 582 EUI2, EUI7, BE2, BE4, NL3, NL5, PT4, UK4.

Only few Member States have designed and implemented communication activities specifically aimed to raise awareness about the NRISs . For example, in Estonia, activities focus on raising public awareness and visibility of the National Roma Integration Council and establishing cooperation with local stakeholders. Communication targets mainly Roma and includes the creation of webpage to disseminate information on project activities and good Roma integration practices, such as trainings for Roma leaders and young people 593 . In Portugal, campaigns linked to the NRIS have been set up and one stakeholder has highlighted the positive impacts of communication and an awareness-raising with respect to the engagement of the Roma Communities 594 . In Poland, the Integration Programme included information and promotion actions such as the organisation of trainings on information campaigns, the distribution of promotion materials, the creation of an internet website, providing direct information to interested entities on projects and strategies in specific areas and on disseminating good practices 595 . The Swedish government uses its \u2018Roma reference group\u2019 to reaching out to Roma representations, hold a yearly consultation with them and disseminate information directly to these representatives and through a website. Some local entities (especially Stockholm) have specific assignments for the dissemination of information 596 . In other Member States, communication activities around the NRISs are not formal or comprehensive communication strategies, but they seem to be limited to the publication of reports on the government websites (e.g. DE) or dissemination of the NRIS among key stakeholders (e.g. issuing of hard and soft copies of the NRIS to Government departments and agencies, local authorities and Roma organisations IE) 597 . In some cases, communication is carried out in the context of broader relevant policies on integration of minorities (e.g. UK or LU) 598 , or generally focused on anti-Gypsyism (e.g. SE) 599 .It has also been highlighted the lack of continuous efforts on communication, as well as the late transmission of information to Roma communities, stakeholders and the public in general (e.g. HR) 600 . In other countries (e.g. EL) 601 activities were planned but not executed. Concerning the enlargement region , in Serbia, there have been meetings with representatives of local governments and NGOs and other outreach activities to present the strategy, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina limited activities have been carried out 602 . 590 EUI7. 591 EUI6. 592 EUI3. 593 EE2. 594 PT3 and PT1. 595 PL1. 596 SE3. 597 DE3 and IE2. 598 UK5 and LU1. 599 SE2. 600 HR4. 601 EL4. 602 WB2 (Serbia), WB8 (Bosnia and Herzegovina), WB9 (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 128 Although no comprehensive communication strategies are in place in these two countries, all enlargement countries, in addition to the public bi-annual Roma Seminars held since 2011 in Western Balkans, e.g. now hold national Public Dialogue Forums where the respective strategies are discussed. The outreach and impact of communication measures appears to be very limited . All the interviews carried out reveal that NGOs are not aware of any communication measure about the NRIS (even in those Member States where the NRCP described some communication measure) 603 . Similarly, several country analysis reports have pointed at the lack of awareness of the NRISs among authorities and other stakeholders. In Spain, the analysis found very little awareness across public administrations (at national, regional and local level). Although the NRCP carried out some communication activities (e.g. celebration of National Roma Day), no communication strategy is in place 604 . In Austria, there is also a lack of awareness of the content and goals of the NRIS, especially among regional and local authorities (PES, police, hospitals, schools) and a perception that communications do not happen in a timely manner. In this sense, according to the country study report, \u2018many representatives from the institutions had reportedly not heard about the NRIS before being invited to the Platform at a later stage\u2019 605 . The same considerations are valid in Greece where, although some activities have been implemented (e.g. meetings), they \u2018can hardly be considered as adequate\u2019 606 . 3.5.5 Is there sufficient administrative capacity at EU, national, sub- national and local level to organize effective coordination of the implementation of the EU Framework and the National Roma Integration Policies? Stakeholders (specifically, NRCPs) consider that the administrative capacity of the EC in coordination is enough and are satisfied with its work. However, other sources suggest that better internal coordination and interconnection, especially with EU funding, is needed. At national level, the administrative capacity varies depending on the country and, overall, small improvements seem to have occurred since the adoption of the Framework (for a complete assessment on the improvements in national/local capacities in the implementation of the NRIS, see Section 3.4.4). EU level The EU Roma Framework is led by the DG JUST, specifically Unit D.1 \u2018Non-discrimination and Roma Coordination\u2019. This DG and its Unit leads the implementation of the EU Roma Framework and is in charge of coordinating the work of other DGs on Roma-related matters. During the scoping interviews , DG JUST has highlighted that the capacity of the Commission to organise the implementation of the EU Framework is challenged by the limited personnel (with six people in charge of 28 Member States) 607 . Stakeholders participating at the workshop highlighted that the Roma Team has promoted effectively the engagement of several key units within the EC for the implementation of the National Strategies. The NRCPs appear satisfied with the coordination work carried out by the Commission.

Some comments (from 5 NRCPs) have pointed to the need to reinforce the capacity , while recognising the importance of the coordination role played by the Commission. In particular, an NRCP of an enlargement country has highlighted the need to increase the EC team dedicated to the EU Framework, while ensuring strong knowledge of social inclusion processes 609 . The 2017 report from OSEPI on \u2018Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future\u2019 stressed \u2018that the role of the EC in ensuring progress of NRIS is essential\u2019 and acknowledged the \u2018undeniable commitment and strong stance of Commissioners (especially DG Justice Commissioners)\u2019. However, the report also pointed out issues, not related to the administrative capacity as such, but rather to the need for a more synergic and coherent approach across DGs, and increased transparency towards CSOs 610 . These considerations are supported by other stakeholders who, while recognising the improvements made, also drew attention to the need to further reinforce the coordination between the EU Framework and other funding and legislative instruments 611 . National / Regional / Local level The 2013 Council Recommendation on Effective Roma Integration Measures in the Member States emphasises the importance of providing NRCPs \u2018with an adequate mandate and resources appropriate to their role\u2019 and strengthening the capacity of local authorities 612 . The Commission\u2019s reports on the implementation of the EU Framework noted that the capacity of the NRCPs, in terms of \u2018mandate, competences, human and financial resources\u2019 and participation in policy design and revision, have improved 613 . However, capacity and resources of both NRCPs and local authorities were still considered as a challenge. The institutional structure behind the implementation of the NRISs and the related administrative capacity largely vary across Member States. The mandate of NRCPs varies across countries and different national Ministries (e.g. Ministries of education, of 608 This data is referred to interviews conducted with 26 NRCPs in the EU and enlargement countries, question \u2018Is the administrative capacity of European Commission sufficient to organize effective coordination of the implementation of the EU Framework?\u2019; out of 26, 9 replied yes, 12 did not reply, and 5 provided comments pointing to the need to reinforce capacity. 609 NRCPs interviews. 610 Open Society European Policy Institute, Report.

Obviously, the size and the skills of staff devoted to the implementation of the NRISs depend on the country and other factors, including the scale of the issues faced. For example, Bulgaria spends a significant amount of FTE on the implementation of the NRIS 615 . In the Netherlands, one person is in charge of the NRCP dedicating 20% of his time to it 616 . Moreover, the efforts for the implementation of the NRISs can be affected by the shifting of priorities at EU and national level. For example, the migration crisis started in 2015 shifted resources away from Roma inclusion 617 . The need for strengthening the capacity of NRCPs and other institutions (particularly local authorities) has been highlighted in several occasions . The interviews with NRCPs provide a mixed picture . Many of the NRCPs interviewed in the EU and enlargement countries (11 out of the 19 that provided an opinion) declare to have sufficient administrative capacity to organise effective coordination of the implementation of the EU Framework 618 . For seven NRCPs, this positive judgment extends also to the administrative capacity of other Ministries or institutions responsible for implementation of specific inclusion policies. Other NRCPs highlight that more resources were needed. For example, in Bulgaria, there have been staff cuts that have reduced the capacity of the NRCP 619 ; in Spain, the country analysis argues that \u2018the lack of adequate resources (staff and budget) is hampering real progress and does not allow for a consistent and regular participation and collaboration\u2019 620 . When it comes to knowledge and expertise, there is a general better understanding of the Roma issues among relevant officials, although improvements depend on the country and NGOs argue that this did not have an impact in practice or that officials lack appropriate skills 621 .

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 131 It has not been possible to fully analyse the efficiency of the EU Framework by assessing the total costs and benefits of the EU Framework, as neither the total value of inputs nor the outcomes achieved could be fully identified. There is a variety of existing reporting and monitoring systems at EU and national level, with certain overlaps and redundancies. While the direct reporting mechanism linked to the EU Framework has improved since 2011, there is overlap and possible redundancy with reporting requirements under other EU instruments (EU funding or European Semester) as well as national NRIS implementation reports. Monitoring instruments established under the EU Framework are comprehensive and complementary. Nevertheless, they are not fully aligned and potential synergies with other EU monitoring mechanisms are not fully exploited. A range of social, fiscal and economic costs and benefits result from the EU Framework and from the implementation of the NRIS. It was not possible to robustly assess how many Roma were reached with investments under mainstream measures, and these figures were not included in this report. National targeted spending on Roma was partially provided by some Member States and only for 2015 and 2016. EU funding data (for ESIF, IPA, REC), especially for the 2014-2020 period, suggests that significant investments in policy measures linked to education and employment were made. For a number of reasons explained in the section, no robust estimates of the actual amounts spent could be made. The long-term benefits of closing the gaps between the Roma and non-Roma populations was estimated in thirteen Member States. This showed that there were significant potential monetary benefits from closing the gaps in employment, earnings and education. It was estimated that the positive results in education measures that resulted from the EU Framework, led to 77,000 fewer Roma early school leavers (ESL). In the long-run, these changes may lead to positive economic impact of around EUR 333 million per year. The assessment of the efficiency of a policy or programme examines how the inputs made by the Commission and Member States have been converted into outcomes or impacts. This can be achieved by comparing the costs of a programme (the inputs) with the benefits (the impacts achieved), alongside an assessment of factors which supported an efficient approach and key challenges which hampered the efficient achievement of outcomes and impacts. For some aspects of efficiency of the EU Framework, directly linked to reporting and monitoring systems or requirements, evidence was available and an assessment could thus be made. Others, related to the wider inputs mobilised under the EU Framework, such as EU funding, are subject to separate evaluation activities, and fall outside the scope of the present evaluation. Evaluations carried out of these funds have been used as secondary sources and considered in the present analysis. As presented in the section on effectiveness, it has not been possible to accurately measure the value of inputs (spending on Roma inclusion), how these have changed since the introduction of the Framework, the number of Roma individuals who have benefitted and linking the inputs to the impacts achieved. Therefore, it has not been possible to produce a robust assessment of the efficiency of the EU Framework. The assessment is mainly based on qualitative evidence. 3.6.1 What factors influenced efficiency of EU and national interventions in the context of the EU Framework, in particular regarding the instruments (such as the NRIS and annual reports by Member States, civil society and the Commission) and governance structures at EU and national levels (National Roma Contact Points and its network, National Roma Platforms, European Platform for Roma Inclusion, civil society consultation meetings, EU Roma Summits)? The efficiency of EU and Member State interventions to implement the EU Framework were influenced by a number of factors linked to coherence to mainstream policies and funding mechanisms, as well as coordination structure of the inputs: ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 132 Mainstreaming of Roma inclusion into EU and National Policies is probably the most efficient way of reaching sustainable and large-scale results with little additional funding, while ensuring that policies and measures are designed in a way that take into account the needs of Roma. Targeted policies and measure are costlier and require additional planning and implementation capacity. As the analysis of mainstreaming (Coherence 3.3.1) showed, this has only been achieved partially, as both at EU level and National level, Roma needs are not fully taken on board, and not considered when designing and implementing policies. Investing in short-term measures and disparate small scale measures, without long-term visions for sustainable results (see Sections 3.3.1.1, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.1.6) limits the efficient use of EU or national funding. Seeking complementarity and synergy when allocating funding (either complementarity between EU and national funds, or between different streams of funding through integrated policy measures) helps to maximise results with limited funding. Country studies and interviews underlined the importance and efficiency of such approaches 623 . Integrated approaches were particularly highlighted in the area of housing, where investments, unless coupled with employment or other social measures may have no long term effect 624 . At the EU level, the complementary use of ESF and ERDF funding (2014-2020) in integrated approaches to poor or urban communities 625 (e.g. combining infrastructural development in education with social inclusion or human capital investment projects) is another example of efficient use of resources to achieve maximum results. Admittedly, this approach was less pronounced in the 2007- 2013 programming period 626 , although there are still various integrated measures or projects that were implemented. 627 \uf09f An important factor to achieve the above mentioned synergies is to have in place appropriate coordination mechanisms . At the EU level, the Roma Task Force (see Coordination 3.5.1) as well the Commission\u2019s internal consultation mechanism ensured to a large extent Roma inclusion issues to be considered in policy design or EU funding. At Member State level, the involvement of National Roma Contact Points or Roma civil society organisations in national policy coordination processes and EU funding programming mechanisms could contribute to more efficient allocation of funds. The NRPCs in many Member States were involved in these processes, especially EU funding programming 628 , while in others they were not 629 (either because they have not been given such role or because they lack capacity). The Roma civil society consultation mechanisms (Roma platforms) are involved to an even lesser extent in funding or mainstream policy design processes (see section 3.5.2 Coordination). 623 CS-AT, CS-BG, CS-RO, CS-ES 624 BG-10, HR-3, CS-IT, IT-10, CS-BG, CS-ES (eg.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 133 3.6.1.1 To what extent are the reporting and monitoring systems in place adequate and what are the respective strengths and points for improvement on EU and national levels? There is variety of existing reporting and monitoring systems at EU and National level, where certain overlaps and redundancies exist. While the direct reporting mechanism linked to the EU Framework has improved since 2011, there is overlap and possible redundancy with reporting requirements under other EU instruments (EU funding or European Semester) as well as national NRIS implementation reports. Monitoring instruments established under the EU Framework are comprehensive and complementary. Nevertheless, they are not fully aligned and potential synergy with other EU monitoring mechanisms is not fully exploited. Reporting In respect to EU level reporting, a reporting requirement for Member States was introduced with the 2013 Council Recommendation, and commenced in 2016 with the first reports for 2015 in a new Online Roma Integration Measures Reporting Tool (referred to later as online reporting tool). Up until that point, reporting was based on a questionnaire template, which was general in nature. Member States provided information with different level of detail, making comparison or oversight difficult. The NRCPs had to collate information provided from different institutions into a single response to the Commission. The reporting tool, even though more comprehensive than the pre-2016 system, is more efficient, as it eliminated the intermediary role of NRCPs to collect and compile data, providing the possibility for responsible authorities to directly input data. Stakeholders nevertheless reported some issues: \uf09f Most of the data required was difficult or impossible to collect. This is because statistics by ethnicity are not collected in many Member States, which in turn led to three types of problems: - Member States did not provide information in their annual report, as it was not possible to collect from existing statistics. This caused a problem as the data set was then incomplete at an EU level, which inhibited the extent to which comparisons between Member States can be made; 630 - Funds and activities managed by sub-national departments, both regional and municipal, were not fed appropriately in the national reporting tool; - Member States attempted to fill data gaps with information from small-scale evaluations and research projects. This was a time consuming and expensive way to collect data, and did not guarantee complete coverage and significance at population level within a Member State. It also reduced the comparability of data across Member States 631 . In addition to the specific reporting requirements linked to the EU Framework, there are similar requirements in place as part of other related EU instruments, in particular the structural (ESIF) and cohesion funds, which each come with their own reporting systems. Even though these serve a very different purpose, in reality, the significant role that EU funding plays in the implementation of most NRIS, means that much of the information reported in DG JUST\u2019s online reporting tool is also reported in EU\u2019s System for Fund Management (SFC), or in other formats if the information is linked to other EU funding, such as the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programmes. Further reporting requirement arise for Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia from the European Semester process \u2013 NRCPs and relevant ministries need to provide their input into the Member State report on the implementation of the 630 Qualitative interviews in CZ, DK, ES, HR, LV, AT and PL. 631 Qualitative interviews with ES, PT ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 134 Recommendations given: again the same measures already reported under the annual implementation reports. Art. 17 of the Racial Directive (2000/43/EC) also mandates that Member States should report every 5 years to the Commission, presumably again reporting on some the legal or anti-discrimination measures already provided in other reports. At Member State level , all Member States have a domestic reporting requirement as well linked to the implementation of the NRIS. As in some Member States the NRIS is broader in scope than the EU Framework, the national implementation reports are even more comprehensive than the reports submitted to the EC. The absence of coordination of reporting times (for example, the reporting period for EU Funding covers the financial year from October of one year to October of the next year), the different reporting formats (use of different online platforms, varying level of detail and different indicators) and the lack of exchanges of information between the above listed reporting schemes, often leads to information being repeated in different places and / or not being properly taken into account. Monitoring systems At EU level the Commission has created a complementary and comprehensive system to monitor the implementation of the EU Framework, which includes the Online Reporting Tool information, the Civil Society Monitoring mechanism, as well as analysis and data collection carried out by the Fundamental Rights Agency. The European Roma Platform and Roma summits, though not a monitoring instruments per se, contribute to monitoring by encouraging participants to share information and concerns. These monitoring instruments generally are complementary to each other. Other EU monitoring systems, for EU Funds or the European Semester, collect relevant information, but are generally not aligned. For instance, the information on indicators of \u2018Roma\u2019 participants in EU funded projects or progress in the absorption of EU Funded instruments that include Roma participants is not readily available or shared with Roma Unit at DG JUST. Similarly, Eurobarometer surveys or Eurostat\u2019s At-risk of Poverty Survey (EU SILC) are not aligned to collect relevant monitoring data \u2013 instead FRA periodic surveys collect data, which is generally less frequent and less reliable due to the small sample sizes and significant costs associated with these surveys. The inclusion of Roma in the EU-MIDIS II survey is, on the other hand, an example of synergic use of resources. In regards to Member States\u2019 level monitoring systems \u2013 thirteen of them foresee in their NRIS some sort of monitoring system or foresee the development of such. Of the eleven Member States included in this report, only Spain has a comprehensive indicator- based monitoring system in place that could be used to monitor the progress in achieving the objectives of the NRIS. The remaining countries either do not have yet such systems, or these are still being developed 632 . The EU Framework does not provide any specific guidelines as to the kind of monitoring system that should be put in place \u2013 therefore the national systems under development will serve the purpose of monitoring NRIS, but may have limited use in allowing for comparability, or even assessing the progress towards achieving the EU Framework objectives (as in a number of Member States the NRIS objectives are different than the EU Framework ones). Similarly, the Civil Society Monitoring mechanism does not include specific guidelines to ensure comparability between reports or complementarity with other EU instruments (e.g. FRA surveys or report) or Member State implementation reports submitted to the EU. The lack of coherence and complementarity between the various monitoring mechanisms limits the overall efficiency of the monitoring system in place. 632 E.g. CS-BG, HR-4 ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 135 3.6.1.2 Is there a need to simplify or reduce administrative burdens on NRCPs and Member State public officials involved in the reporting and information gathering process? Evidence suggests that in many Member States individuals involved with the reporting and monitoring process considered that there could be a reduction in the administrative burden 633 . Substantiating these claims with comprehensive evidence on the actual costs (in terms of full time equivalent) in terms of time that the reporting process involves has not been possible for a number of reasons: \uf09f Only nine NRCPs 634 were able to provide the number of staff and/ or the amount of time required to complete the reporting and monitoring tasks through stakeholder consultation. The time taken by each organisation to collect data, attend meetings and produce the final report to send to the Commission ranged from a few days 635 to a few weeks 636 of staff time a year. However, as staff time spent on reporting is available only in a limited number of NRCPs, this evidence cannot support a conclusive, quantitative assessment of the current efficiency of this reporting mechanism across the EU. \uf09f Data from other institutions is not readily available and it was difficult for NRCPs to collect information. \uf09f Regional or local data collection that is used to gather the information needed for the national level report could be a significant. For instance, in Bulgaria there are over 240 municipal reports and 28 regional reports, with an estimated over 700 individuals involved in reporting and data gathering tasks 637 . In Spain, also where there is regional government involvement, most regions were not able to provide exact estimate (the ones that could estimated 50-100 hours per year), while the central level institutions outside the NRCPs could not provide data. \uf09f The key difficulty in estimating the time involved in the reporting process is not assessing the time of the individuals that actually complete the online reporting tool forms 638 , but it is the collection of information needed to complete the forms, and the amount of time spent by other public servants no directly reporting, but summarising and presenting the information prior to being included in the report submitted to the Commission. \uf09f Due to overlaps with other reporting processes (e.g. reporting requirements to national authorities / Parliament; reporting requirements from EU funds, or European semester) some of the costs need to be reduced, as this information is collected anyway. The reporting costs also overlap with costs linked to the requirement of appointing an NRCP (see next section, which assesses these costs), who key responsibility, amongst other things, is also to reporting on the implementation of the NRIS. The main areas in which there is scope for improvement include: 633 AT, CY, CZ, DE, EE, EL, FI, FR, HR, IE, LT, NL, PT, SE, SI, UK. Additionally, a West Balkan regional body and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 634 CY, CZ, EL, ES, FI, HR, LT, L,V SI. 635 CY 636 SI 637 CS-BG; 638 This could be assessed fairly straightforward by examining the number of reported measures (939 in 2016, and 937 in 2015) and trying to assess average time to complete the information on one measure. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 136 \uf09f The reporting timelines for EU reporting do not align with Member State statistical deadlines. This means that the data the Member States have to provide is either out of date, or burdensome to collect as not yet released. \uf09f Given that some Member States could not provide Roma-specific statistics, the efforts required to complete the report with other or qualitative information were considered to be disproportionate, without clear added value to the monitoring process. \uf09f The frequency and level of reporting could be linked to the size of the Roma population in the Member State, and Member States with small Roma populations may and few policies may report less frequently. There are various ways in which COM could still monitor progress while reducing the administrative burden and increasing efficiency, for example by: \uf09f Introducing a \u2018materiality\u2019 threshold that eliminates reporting on small projects without considerable contribution to achieving the objectives of the EU Framework. Such small projects that only have some added value in terms of \u2018exchange of experience\u2019 could have different format or frequency. \uf09f Reducing the frequency of reporting: achieving the objectives of the EU Framework, as recognised by the Commission is a long and slow process. Changes in inclusion relevant statistics related to Roma have little year-to-year changes. Annual information gathering may be substituted by gathering to existing instruments: e.g. translations of annual national reports; sharing information between EU institutions (on progress in EU funds or European Semester Reports. \uf09f \uf09f Moving away from annual reporting into strategic cycle reporting would reduce the administrative burden experienced by many NRCPs with regard to their reporting duties, and be a more appropriate model considering that the vast majority of policies that are implemented under NRIS are long-term. Consequently, a staggered reporting model would provide data of greater meaning and comparability (therefore increasing the effectiveness of the reporting and monitoring mechanism), without compromising on efficiency. 3.6.2 What have been the costs and benefits of Roma inclusion in the context of EU Framework and NRIS? 639 The approach to assessing the efficiency of the EU Framework differs from the \u2018usual\u2019 efficiency analysis of EU funding instruments (which include the assessment of efficiency of the funds invested), or analysis of compliance costs or fiscal / economic impacts of EU legal instruments. A cost benefit analysis has been used to support the assessment of the efficiency of NRIS Framework. This involved identifying the cost of provisions to support Roma Integration (financial expenditure), and identifying the benefits of progress made in Roma integration, quantifying and monetising the progress where possible. Where it was not possible to quantify and monetise the impacts, a qualitative assessment of progress has been provided. 639 The original evaluation question formulated in the Terms of Reference, asked \u201cWhat are the Costs of Roma Exclusion / benefits of Inclusion\u201d. While this is an important questions, for the purpose of the EU Framework assessment the proposed to focus was changed to the current question \u201cWhat have been the costs and benefits of Roma inclusion in the context of the EU Framework and National Roma Integration Strategies?\u201d. Formulated in this way, the question reflects more closely the Better Regulations guidelines. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 137 The costs and benefits of Roma integration have been difficult to quantify, due to a lack of data on the financial resources invested in Roma integration in each Member State and quantitative data on the benefits of integration only being available for a small number of Member States (see also box below). This is due to many Member States not collecting information on ethnicity. There are also difficulties in assessing the extent to which the costs and benefits associated with Roma inclusion are attributable to the EU Framework. This is because actions to promote Roma integration may have happened in the absence of the Framework. However, some types of costs and benefits are easier to attribute to the Framework: \uf09f Costs and benefits linked to EU Framework and NRIS \u2013 This refers to the costs of reporting on monitoring and implementation of EU Framework) and benefits from EU level action (e.g. in terms of an increased capacity of national/local actors, an increased number of NRIS measures coordination and reporting, as well as the costs and benefits of the policy measures foreseen for the implementation of the NRIS. There are costs associated with the NRIS in each Member State, including the costs of the policy measures foreseen for the implementation of the NRIS and their benefits (in the areas of education, employment, housing and health). These costs can be estimated using information provided on targeted measures provided by the Member States. \uf09f Short-term benefits linked to NRIS \u2013 There are some short-term benefits linked to the NRIS can be quantified and monetised in a small number of Member States, where data is available. These include, for example, changes in participation in education and employment. \uf09f Longer-term fiscal and economic benefits 640 - in the longer term, progress made in the four areas (education, employment, housing and health) will bring fiscal benefits such as impact on contributions to the government budget (increased tax payment, social security, indirect taxes, such as VAT or excise tax) 641 or impact on public expenditure (social welfare, unemployment or child support payments). The integration of Roma could also positively impact the labour market (improved efficiency through diminished labour and skills shortages 642 ) and the economy 643 , in particular GDP / GDP per person. Some of these longer term benefits have been estimated for a small number of Member States, where data is available. As it was possible to assess some of the costs and benefits of the Framework and NRIS, a CBA approach has been used. 640 https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/Empowerment-through-Employment-Brief- 20120918.pdf 641 Kertesi, G\u00e1bor, and G\u00e1bor K\u00e9zdi. 2006.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 138 Administrative costs linked to the EU Framework and NRIS The interviews with stakeholders and analysis of the online reporting tool were used to estimate the time required to implement NRIS, which, when aggregated, shows that there were an estimated 164 individuals in EU Member States within the lead organisation who were funded to support the NRIS, and these individuals were estimated to be working full time on the Framework. Using a Standard Cost Model, it was estimated that the administration cost of EUR 3 million annually 644 and is driven by a high number of staff reported in three Member States (SK, HU and IT). A sensitivity analysis (see Annex 3) was undertaken which altered the assumption that these staff worked full-time on the EU Framework. The sensitivity analysis produced a low estimate of the administration cost associated with NRIS and the EU framework of EUR 1.4 million per year, and a high estimate of EUR 3.7 million per year. The tasks undertaken by the NRCP include: policy coordination, monitoring how the strategies are implemented, compiling reports, coordinating and meeting with local authorities and other agencies supporting Roma integration, running Roma Platforms and engaging with the Roma community. Member States with larger populations of Roma tend to have a higher number of staff (and costs) devoted to the NRIS. The estimated administration cost of EUR 3 million within Member State authorities appears to be a high given the types of task required to be undertaken as part of the EU Framework and NRIS. However, the number of staff contributing to the EU Framework reporting in each Member State is likely to be an underestimate, mostly because additional individuals and organisations are involved in the process (individuals from local government organisations), for example by collecting information and/or attending steering group meetings, and their time inputs are not known. Costs associated with NRIS implementation Funding from many different data sources is used to support the inclusion of the Roma, including EU, national and local government funding. Despite data being collected for the overall funding streams (for example the total spent by an EU fund or programme, or national spending on a particular policy area \u2013 for example housing, health or education), the data for the funding for the NRIS implementation is incomplete and lacks comparability. Data on allocations to the inclusion of the Roma between 2011 and 2015 644 For more information on the methodology see Annexe 1. Box 2. Methodological Limitations There is little data available which examines the participation of the Roma population in employment, education, housing and health. Where this data does exist, only two time periods are available (2011 and 2016) and it is only available for a limited number of Member States. As there is only information for two time periods available, it is not possible to analyse the trend of the data over time, and whether either of the two points are outliers from the general trend. Additionally, the data is based on surveys with a limited sample size, meaning the precision of the estimated values is not as high as official national statistics (for example the Labour Force Survey or EU-SILC). Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the changes in Roma participation and the economic value of these changes. An attempt has been made to monetise the changes in Roma participation in education and employment. However, these should be viewed in the context of the available evidence, and treated with caution. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 139 is of even lower quality. Therefore, it is not possible to identify how the level of funding has changed since the implementation of the Framework began. To ensure that the evidence on funding has been explored as comprehensively as possible, the following information sources have been investigated: \uf09f The online reporting tool, in which Member States provide information on EU (ESIF only) and national funding for Roma integration. \uf09f ESF / ERDF Member State Operational Programmes implementation reports (2007-2013 and 2014-2020) to identify projects and funding targeting the Roma and the number of beneficiaries targeted. This included examining the project descriptions to identify financial information outside programme indicators, which were found to be mostly incomplete. \uf09f The IPA evaluation, to establish funding through the IPA for the Roma; \uf09f Other European funding programmes, such as PROGRESS, ERAMUS+, FEAD and Rights, Equality and Citizenship (REC) programme, HORIZON 2020. \uf09f National research to identify any further funding streams. \uf09f A review of interviews and survey responses, where some funding information is provided. Despite examining all these different information sources, it was not possible to robustly identify the current or previous levels of expenditure on Roma inclusion, and to assess the efficiency of spending. In the subsection below an attempt is made to assess efficiency at least partially, based on an analysis of the data that is available. 3.6.2.1 National spending as reported in the online reporting tool An overview of national spending on Roma inclusions in education, employment, health and housing 645 is presented in Table 25 and 26 below, based on information extracted from the online reporting tool . Comprehensive comparable data is only available for the years 2015 and 2016, and is based on information from 24 Member States that reported to the European Commission. Member States reported financial information on two types of measures \u2013 \u2018mainstream\u2019 and \u2018targeted\u2019. The mainstream data does not allow to assess what proportion of it was spent on Roma, neither can be assumed that the amount for Roma should proportionate to the share of the population that Roma represent in the country, as they have very different demographic, social, health, or economic profile. Therefore, it differs between policy area and measures, as well as between Member States. These figures have been therefore ignored. As the data is self-reported there are some concerns about the reliability and comparability of the data between Member States and years. There are only two years\u2019 worth of data and not all Member States reported in both years, so it is difficult to quality assure the data. The table below presents the data as reported in the online tool. A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken which helps to highlight concerns about the reliability of the data. The targeted funding reported, includes two types of indicators \u2013 \u2018allocated\u2019 and \u2018spent\u2019. Member States entered the allocated once a measure was adopted. Therefore, if a measure spans over several years, it is the \u2018spent\u2019 indicator that should provide information as to whether the measure was actually implemented. The information below shows the total allocations and total spending for the years 2015 and 2016. In 2015 and 2016, the largest proportion of Member State spending was 645 Other categories are included in the reports. The additional categories are: Anti-discrimination, Multiple discrimination, Poverty reduction through social investment, Empowerment, Local action, Monitoring and Evaluation, Transnational Cooperation, Culture, Other ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 140 focussed on educational inclusion (98% of allocation and actual expenditure in 2015; 55% in 2016). In both 2015 and 2016, Member States generally did not spend the full allocation on Roma inclusion. I should be noted that certain areas, the information provided was \u20180\u2019. Some of the difference between allocation and spending could be due to the implementation of long-term projects and delays in absorbing allocated funds. 646 Other issues could be surrounding the data (for example not being certain how much mainstream funding has been allocated to the Roma). However, it is not possible to state with certainty why spending is lower than allocation. Table 25.

In summary, this analysis included a comparison of targeted spending and mainstream spending (See Annex 1). Where entries for targeted spending in the online reporting tool seemed too high, this was removed as an inaccurate value for a low estimate of spending. Where data was missing, a proportion of the total targeted spending was assumed to be the targeted spending for that Member State. A detailed description of the sensitivity analysis is presented in Annex 1. 646 For example see European Commission (2018) Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 141 The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the table below. This shows that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the value of targeted national spending on Roma inclusion in both 2015 and 2016. Table 27.

Data from SFC is first presented. ESF The ESF is Europe\u2019s main instrument for supporting the development of human capital and jobs, but also includes measures on education, health, and housing. Roma integration initiatives were primarily financed under the ESF priority themes for social inclusion. During 2007-2013 period, EUR 11.5 billion was allocated (of EU and national co-financing) to social inclusion measures in ESF Operational Programmes. Roma benefited from measures targeting all marginalised and vulnerable groups. However, as Roma were not explicitly mentioned as an \"investment priority\u201d, no aggregate financial information is available showing the proportion of this funding that was devoted to the integration of marginalised Roma communities. The Operational Programmes for the period 2007-2013 have been examined, to see if there was any mention of Roma specific targets, but it was not possible to use the few indications identified as evidence, to establish overall amounts. In the 2014-2020 period for the ESF, investment priority 9ii targets Roma explicitly, but not exclusively. The target includes the socio-economic integration of marginalised communities, which includes the Roma but also all other communities that are marginalised through material deprivation, inadequate housing, low educational levels, high unemployment, poor health as well as discrimination and prejudice. 647 Twelve Member States have Operational Programmes which include investment priority 9ii, allocating a total of EUR 1.5 billion, or 3.6% of ESF funding (see Table below). The Member States that allocated the implementation of funding under the investment priority 9ii \u2013 such as BG, CZ, HU, RO and SK - experienced significant delays in spending the EU funding. At the end of 2016, ESF absorption rates were 15.5% in Bulgaria, 13.8% in Czech Republic, 4.3% in Hungary, and 0% in Romania and Slovakia.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 142 costs for 2014-2016 for the eight Member States under 9ii were 7.2% or 132.9 million. 648 Unlike the 2007-2013 period, in the present programming period, a number of Member States used in their operational programmes specific indicators for Roma participants targeted by the policies. Only two (AT & FR 649 ) out of the eight countries that had eligible cost under IP 9ii did not particularly identify Roma as a target group \u2013 all others did: BE, BG, ES, GR, HU, IT, RO. These indicators were reviewed but it has not been possible to tie specific indicators to projects and overall amounts. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that the majority part of the funding as part of IP 9ii was spent on Roma Under ESF investment priority 9ii the participants involved between 2014 and 2016 were 5,752 with a target value of 41,279 up to 2020. These include but are not exclusively the Roma. The low number of participants is at least in part due to the fact that some Member States with investment priority 9ii in their OPs have not yet reported on this in their 2017 annual implementation reports. It is expected that an increase in the number of participants will be reported with the 2018 annual implementation reports. Roma also benefit from ESF funding under other investment priorities, including other aspects of thematic objective 9 (Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination), thematic objective 8 (Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility) and thematic objective 10 (Investing in education, training and lifelong learning). It is not possible to identify what proportion of funding in these priorities is for disadvantaged groups, or the Roma specifically. Table 27 below provides a summary of the ESF funding to Member States with an allocation to investment priority 9ii (IP 9ii) in 2014-2020 period. This shows that the largest amount of funding was allocated in Romania and Hungary, but the Member State which has the highest proportion of ESF funding in investment priority 9ii is Bulgaria. As indicated above, these figures on IP 9ii do not reflect the overall amount invested in Roma inclusion, because Roma could benefit under other IPs and other groups can benefit through IP 9ii. 648 European Commission (2018) Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports, 649 France has constitutional limitations to earmarking funding to specific ethnic groups.

In absolute terms, most funding has been allocated in Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic. In 2016, under ESF thematic objectives 8, 9 and 10 and Youth Employment Initiative, a total of 625,542 persons were counted under the output common indicator \u201cmigrants, participants with a foreign background, minorities (including marginalised communities such as the Roma)\u201d, while the target value was 442,263 persons 650 . However, this figure could include some double counting, as an individual can be counted in separately while participating in different projects. ERDF The ERDF aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by correcting imbalances between its regions. It provides more funding to disadvantaged regions.

Thematic objective 9 has been allocated the highest share of funding out of the three inclusive growth related thematic objectives, namely EUR 11.4 billion of the ERDF in total (56% of the total ERDF allocation) in the funding period 2014-2020. There was no relationship between the size of the Roma population in a Member State and the proportion of ERDF funding which was directed to thematic objective 9. 651 Almost all Member States, with the exception of Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland and Denmark, have allocated ERDF funding to this thematic objective. No information is available on ERDF funds allocated to Roma. As in ESF, some Operating Programmes have Roma specific indicators, but these could not be tied to overall amounts. 3.6.2.3 ESIF spending as reported in the online reporting tool In addition, to the information from the implementation report and programming information (contained in the EU System for Fund Management), national authorities were also requested to enter financial information in the online reporting tool. This is presented in Table 28. NRCPs estimate that a total of EUR 441 million was allocated from EU funds to measures relating to education, housing, employment and health in 2015, and EUR 54 in 2016. To date, 4% of ESIF funding allocated in 2015 and 2016 has been spent. It is important to bear in mind that ESIF funds can be spent over the full period from 2014 to 2020, and projects can be delayed. As previous programming periods show, spending in the first years of the programme is always much lower and usually picks up after two or three years, when projects have had sufficient time to start up and absorb funding. This is particular true for measures which are \u2018novel\u2019 and require more set-up time. As with the data presented on national spending above, as the data is self-reported there are some concerns about the reliability and comparability of the data between Member States and years. There are only two years\u2019 worth of data and not all Member States reported in both years, so it is difficult to quality assure the data.

The projects funded in the second wave (the call issued in 2011) were invited to focus on one of the following themes: (1) social inclusion of vulnerable groups, such as Roma people, migrants and their descendants, homeless and young people. The programme was focussed on five main areas \uf09f Employment \uf09f Social inclusion and social protection \uf09f Working conditions \uf09f Anti-discrimination \uf09f Gender equality As part of PROGRESS, the European Commission monitored which projects were solely or partially targeted at the Roma population, and the level of funding allocated to these projects. The Commission categorised these projects by how prominently the Roma feature in the project plan. The categories are: \uf09f A Roma network, funded through a PROGRESS grant, European Roma Information Office (ERIO); \uf09f Level 1: Antidiscrimination projects, targeting only the vulnerable group of Roma, thus a pure Roma project; and \uf09f Level 2: Antidiscrimination projects with a complete activity/strand/work stream targeting Roma; and The funding for each year between 2008 and 2013 is presented in table below. This shows that at least one project every year in some respect aimed to support the Roma population. In total, nearly EUR 1 million was spent on a Roma network and over EUR 600,000 was spent on projects targeting the Roma population exclusively. A further EUR 1, 05 million was spent on projects which in part targeted the Roma population.

REC continued the PROGRESS and Justice Programme (2007-2013), which included five programmes, the most relevant of which for Roma were the Fundamental Rights and the Daphne Programmes. The Fundamental Rights Programme (EUR 95.2 million) included 22 projects that specifically targeted Roma (some not exclusively), with a total value of EUR 7.76 million (8.2% of total funding) 652 . All 22 projects focused on tackling different forms of discrimination and inequality of Roma. The analysis showed that six projects had evidence of impact and positive outcomes. Three projects did not have evidence of impact, while in the rest there was limited evidence of impact. The Daphne III Programme , with a total budget of EUR 123.88 million supported preventive measures and support and protection for victims and groups at risk. Twelve projects (out of 302) with a total budget EUR 3.6 million (3% of total funding) specifically targeted Roma. The projects focused on preventing hate-crimes, child abuse and trafficking of vulnerable sub-groups in the Roma community (children and women). Some of the supporting preventive measures and providing support and protection for victims and groups at risk. Since 2014, the REC has funded 43 projects which specifically targeted the Roma population, and in particular promoting non-discrimination. These projects received EUR 6.9 million of EU funding (with total funding of EUR 8.4 million). Since 2014, the REC thus represents both a higher number of projects and a higher average annual spending than in the previous programming period. Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) The FEAD programme supports EU countries' actions to provide material assistance to the most deprived. This can include food, clothing and other essential items for personal use. The programme also supports social inclusion measures, such as guidance and support to help people out of poverty and measures to support integration into society. In real terms, over \u20ac3.8 billion are earmarked for the FEAD for the 2014-2020 period. In addition, EU countries are to contribute at least 15% in national co-financing to their national programme. The total value of FEAD spending for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, as presented in in the table below, amounted to over EUR 3 billion, with 12% of participants being from the category migrants, participants with a foreign background, minorities (including marginalised communities such as the Roma). However, it is unclear how much funding from FEAD is used to support Roma participants. 652 The information in this section is based on analysis of project data collected by ICF in the process of the prior analysis of the Justice Programme.

However, it has not been possible to establish the degree to which such changes are directly attributable to the introduction of the Roma framework or to other, external factors. More details of the methodology see Annex 1. Education The FRA data for early years\u2019 education and Early School Leaving (ESL) has been analysed for the Roma and general populations to explore the impact of promoting Roma inclusion. The participation rate in ECEC among the Roma population significantly increased in six out of the nine Member States for which data is available. The number of young people in ECEC in these seven Member States is 14,100 higher than if the participation rate had remained at the 2011 level. In the future, this could lead to an additional EUR 9.7 million in annual earnings for this cohort of Roma individuals, and an additional EUR 2.2 million in tax receipts in future years, when the cohort of children reach working age. The participation rate among the Roma population was also compared to the participation rate among the general population, to examine if the participation rate among the Roma population has changed at a different rate than would be expected (due to overall economic conditions and population level Government drivers). The participation among the Roma population has increased at a faster rate than in the general population in six Member States. The number of young Roma attending ECEC in these six Member States is 13,500 individuals higher than if the participation rate for Roma had grown at the same rate as the general population. In the future, this could lead to an additional EUR 9.3 million in annual earnings for this cohort of Roma individuals, and an additional EUR 2.1 million in tax receipts. 656 In the two Member States where the Roma participation in early school education fell, there were 4,700 fewer young Roma participating in early school education than there would have been if the 2011 participation rate was maintained. 657 This could lead to a loss of EUR 1.3 million annually in earnings to the Roma population, and EUR 0.3 million in tax. The same results were obtained when the change in the Roma participation rate was compared to the general population, as the general population rate in both Member States remained constant (in one MS the participation rate changed by one percentage point, in the other there was no change). 656 This calculation assumes that individuals participating in Early School Education have earnings 10% higher than those that do not. For more information see XREF (Annex) 657 In one Member State the change in the rate of participation in ECEC was not significant. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 152 The participation rate of Roma in ECEC in five enlargement countries was also explored using the same approach as for the Member States. Compared to 2011, the participation rates in two enlargement countries had increased. This means that an additional 200 young Roma are in ECEC than if the participation rate had remained at the 2011 rate. This could lead to an increase in earnings among the Roma population of EUR 53,000 per year in future years (when the cohort enters the labour market) and an increase in EUR 6,000 in tax per year. However, the participation rate has decreased in three enlargement countries, leading to 400 fewer Roma children attending ECEC per year than if the 2011 rate had been maintained, and a potential future loss of earnings and tax of EUR 72,000 and EUR 11,000 per year respectively. When compared to the changes in the participation rates in ECEC among the general population, in two of the five countries the participation rate of Roma in ECEC had increased leading to an additional 300 young Roma individuals attending ECEC and a potential increase in earnings of nearly EUR 60,000 a year. In the three countries where the rate of Roma participation in Early School Education had fallen below the expected level, 500 fewer young Roma were attending Early School Education and this could lead to a loss of EUR 110,000 per year. The proportion of young Roma who were early leavers from education and training has significantly decreased between 2011 and 2016 in seven out of the nine Member States where data is available. The decrease in the ESL rate among Roma means that there are 78,000 fewer Roma early school leavers than if ESL rates had stayed at the 2011 level, leading to an economic benefit of EUR 370 million per year. The positive economic impact would be due to the cohort of Roma pupils being more likely to be employed and earning higher wages as a result of remaining in school, as well as further economic benefits due to improved health and well-being and a reduced likelihood of committing crime. 658 In six of these Member States, the rate has decreased at a faster rate for Roma than in the general population (in PT the rate has fallen faster in the general population than in the Roma population, and in EL and HR the rates are not significantly different from the expected rate). The decrease in the ESL rate among Roma means that there are 77,000 fewer Roma early school leavers than would have been expected if the Roma ESL rate changed at the same rate as the general population. This would lead to a positive economic impact of around EUR 333 million per year. In the one Member State where the ESL rate has decreased slower in the Roma population than in the general population, there is little difference between the rates and the economic impact is negligible. Employment The FRA data provides estimates of the proportion of the Roma working age population who were employed in both 2011 and 2016. In two out of nine Member States where data is available, the employment rate of Roma has significantly increased (and in a further four there has been no significant change). This means that an extra 62,000 Roma are employed than would have been the case if the Roma employment rate had remained at the 2011 level. This is estimated to lead to an EUR 266 million per year in earnings for the Roma population, and an extra EUR 73 million in tax receipts per year. However, in the three remaining Member States the employment rate of Roma is lower than in 2011. This means that 56,000 fewer Roma are employed than if the employment level had remained at the 2011 level, leading to an annual decrease of EUR 425 million in earnings and EUR 101 million in tax receipts. 658 The calculation assumes that each individual who is an ESL costs the economy through lost wages, and increased social costs. This cost varies by Member State. For more information see XREF (Annex) ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 153 The change in the employment rate among Roma individuals and the general population has been compared, using LFS data to compare the rate of employment. 659 This shows that in three out of the nine Member States where data is available, the employment situation of the Roma population improved compared to the general population between 2011 and 2016 (EL, PT and HU), while in the other six the situation deteriorated (BG, CZ, HR, ES, RO and SK). Within the three countries showing increased employment rates compared to the general population, the progress is estimated at an additional 40,000 Roma individuals in employment, estimated to result in an additional total EUR 200 million in income in 2016 (and additional tax of EUR 54 million). 660, 661 However, in the other six Member States, the decrease is estimated to represent 100,000 Roma individuals, costing the Roma community over EUR 665 million in lost wages (and EUR 160 million in tax). In the five enlargement countries where data was analysed, the employment of Roma was below the expected rate in all five countries, leading to an estimated loss of wages of nearly EUR 50 million (and EUR 12 million in tax). The FRA data also allows for a comparison of the rate of young people who are Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET) between 2011 and 2016 in the Roma population. This shows that between 2011 and 2016, the rate of young Roma who are NEET has significantly decreased in one out of the nine Member States where data is available (PT). This leads to an annual economic benefit of EUR 12 million, compared to if the rate of young Roma who are NEET had remained at the 2011 level. However, in five Member States, the rate of young Roma who are NEET has increased compared to the 2011 rate, leading to an economic cost of EUR 179 million per year. The change in the rate of young people who are NEET in the Roma population has been compared to the change in the rate in the general population. This shows that in one out of the nine Member States, the rate of NEETs among the Roma population has improved compared to the general population (PT). This means that there are almost 1,400 fewer Roma young people who are NEET than would be expected if the change in NEET rates followed the general population trend. This would provide economic benefits of over EUR 11.5 million in 2016. The positive economic impact would be due to the cohort of Roma pupils being more likely to be employed and earning higher wages as a result of no longer being NEET, as well as further economic benefits due to improved health and well-being and a reduced likelihood of committing crime. 662 However, in five Member States the rate of young Roma people who are NEET is higher than the expected level . This leads to an additional 43,000 young Roma individuals being NEET than would be expected if the change in the Roma NEET rate followed the general population trend. This was estimated to cost the economy EUR 191 million in 2016. Health and Housing The changes in reaching health or housing objectives has been presented in section Effectiveness. As noted, there is no objective health related data to allow estimates about actual health status. The usual health proxy indicator that could be used to 659 The employment rate as derived from FRA survey is distinct from the ILO concept of employment and the one used in the Labour Force Survey (variable MAINSTAT). Here, \u2018Employment\u2019 also includes small amounts of unpaid work in family businesses, as this is for the family\u2019s gain. 660 This calculation assumes that each additional person employed earns the average wage for a Roma individual, and is employed for a full year. For more details see Annex (XREF) 661 It should be noted that although these are benefits to the Roma population, they are not necessarily benefits to the whole economy. For there to be a benefit to the whole economy, these would have to be additional jobs in the economy \u2013 rather than the Roma replacing non-Roma individuals in employment. It is not possible to establish whether these jobs / workers are additional or replacing other jobs / workers in the economy. 662 The calculation assumes that each individual who is NEET costs the economy through lost wages, and increased social costs. This cost varies by Member State. For more information see XREF (Annex) ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 154 estimate economic benefit is life expectancy, which translates into improved labour productivity, as well as life-long tax contributions. The most recent EU-wide Census was in 2011, which does not allow to measure changes. On the housing objectives there has been no progress, and no associated benefit. Housing benefits typically affect health, and therefore indirectly have the same expected long-term benefits. 3.6.2.7 To what extent is EU and national funding in the area of Roma inclusion justified and proportionate to the long-term benefits from Roma inclusion in quality inclusive mainstream education, employment, healthcare and housing? The potential longer term benefits of Roma inclusion are presented in this section. There is a large body of evidence which justifies the need for national and EU spending on Roma inclusion, showing the benefits of additional education, employment and training. A Multi-criteria analysis has been undertaken to demonstrate the long-term benefits of spending on Roma inclusion (for more information on the methodology, see Annex 1). The estimations below demonstrate that it is economically efficient to target Roma inclusion. Education The multi-criteria analysis used information from the UNDP-WB-European Commission, FRA report Eurofound and Eurostat 663 to estimate the cost of Roma educational exclusion. A detailed description of the methodology is presented in the Annex 1. In 13 Member States in the EU 664 , it was estimated that: \uf09f The cost of the gap in ECEC participation between Roma and non-Roma in all 13 Member States was estimated to represent nearly EUR 52 million a year, with a loss of tax receipts of up to EUR 13.7 million per year; \uf09f The gap in ESL rates between Roma and the general population is estimated to be 333,000 Roma individuals , which if closed could bring long term benefits of EUR 1.7 billion per year; The same analysis was conducted using UNDP-WB-European Commission for five enlargement countries 665 . This found that: \uf09f The cost of the gap in ECEC is estimated to be EUR 2.3 million a year, with a loss of EUR 570,000 in tax; \uf09f The cost of the gap in ESL between Roma and the general population was estimated to affect 42,000 Roma individuals and cost EUR 33 million. These large costs demonstrate that there are significant benefits which could be realised by improving Roma inclusion in the EU. 663 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) data; Available at: http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/ourwork/sustainable-development/development- planning-and-inclusive-sustainable-growth/roma-in-central-and-southeast-europe/roma-data.html.

",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 155 Employment The multi-criteria analysis examined data from the UNDP-WB-European Commission data and FRA data, along with information from Eurostat to estimate the cost of the exclusion of Roma in the area of employment and the cost of young Roma being NEET. It analysed the difference in the NEET rate, employment and pay rates for Roma and non-Roma individuals, and estimated the economic effect of removing these gaps. The main analysis focussed on the six Member States where UNDP-WB-European Commission data is available 666 , widened to include further Member States (using FRA and Eurostat data), although these estimates are less robust 667 . The analysis estimated that: \uf09f The annual cost of the employment gap between Roma and non-Roma populations amounts to EUR 3.1 billion in the six Member States (EUR 16.3 billion across 13 Member States); \uf09f The annual cost of employed Roma individuals being paid less than non-Roma individuals (wage gap) was estimated to represent EUR 1.2 billion in the six Member States (EUR 3.2 billion in the 13 Member States); \uf09f The annual cost of a loss of tax receipts from the combined employment and wage gap was estimated to be EUR 1 billion in the six Member States (EUR 5 billion in the 13 Member States). \uf09f The cost of the proportion Roma young people who are NEET being higher than the non-Roma population is estimated at EUR 1.6 billion annually. Again, the same analysis was conducted using UNDP-WB-European Commission for five enlargement countries 668 . This found that: \uf09f The annual cost of the employment gap between Roma and non-Roma populations amounts to EUR 445 million in the five countries; \uf09f The annual cost of employed Roma individuals being paid less than non-Roma individuals (wage gap) was estimated to represent EUR 239 million in the five countries; \uf09f The annual cost of a loss of tax receipts from the combined employment and wage gap was estimated to be EUR 171 million in the five countries. \uf09f The cost of the additional proportion of Roma being NEET compared to the non- Roma population is estimated at EUR 32 million annually. This shows that there are large potential benefits for improving Roma integration in the area of employment. Health Improving Roma integration will lead to an increase in the number of people in a Member State benefiting from health interventions, programmes and engaging with health professionals. While initially an increased share of the Roma population engaging with health professionals will lead to higher costs for health services, in the long-term this will lead to health benefits in the Roma population, as a result of better engagement in public health interventions and early diagnosis of health problems, increased vaccinations, and lower costs for health services, due to a reduction in (more expensive) hospital admissions. 666 BG, HR, CZ, HU, RO, SK. 667 EL, PT, ES, FR, IT, DE, UK. 668 These enlargement countries are: AL, BA, ME, RS and MK. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 156 Data from Eurostat Health Statistics has been analysed to estimate the cost of hospital admissions in the EU. It is estimated that there were 88 million hospital admissions in 2015. The level of expenditure for these admissions was EUR 554 billion. This means that the average cost of a hospital admission is EUR 6,300. As the average cost of a hospital admission is high, spending to reduce the number of hospital admissions is likely to generate benefits from the reduction in hospital admissions. Housing The benefits of improving Roma inclusion in the area of housing will not lead to any additional long term benefits other than those already discussed. Providing more housing or better quality housing can lead to reductions in poverty, which in turn leads to societal benefits relating to educational achievement, labour market participation, health benefits, reductions in crime and improvements in community cohesion. Therefore, the benefits described above will also relate to the spending on housing. The evidence collected provides some information on the level of funding from EU and national budgets and comparatively less on the number of beneficiaries and the benefits imparted to them. The limited availability of information hinders the assessment of efficiency for this priority area. 3.6.2.8 Cost and benefits summary The reported spending by both Member State and the European Commission to promote Roma shows the targeted spending on Roma integration in education, employment, housing and health was higher in 2015 than in 2016 (EUR 286 in 2015 compared to EUR 26 million in 2016). This only presents the spending which could be attributed directly to Roma integration (ESIF, REC and Member State Government funding), and the Roma population may have received further funding from sources which were no solely focussed on Roma integration. The majority of the funding identified as being targeted at the Roma population came from Member State Governments. The benefits of Roma inclusion (between 2011 and 2016) have been estimated for employment and education. These estimates should be viewed with caution, as they may not be attributable to the EU Framework. However, since 2011, the employment situation for the Roma has improved in two out of eight Member States, leading to an estimated annual benefit of EUR 200 million to the Roma population in those countries and additional tax receipts of EUR 54 million. In other countries however, the employment situation of Roma individuals worsened, leading to a loss to the Roma population of EUR 665 million annually, and a loss of EUR 160 million per year. Additionally, the proportion of Roma who are NEET has decreased in three out of eight Member States, leading to an annual economic benefit of EUR 29 million annually due to improved employment and earnings and a reduction in public expenditure. However, the proportion of Roma young people who are NEET has increased in five Member States, leading to an economic cost of EUR 177 million annually. The number of young Roma participating in ECEC has increased in six of the eight countries where data is available, which is estimated to lead to an increase in employment and earnings in the Roma community with a value of EUR 4.6 million a year once the cohort enters the labour market. The proportion of Roma who are ESL decreased in all eight Member States where data is available, leading to an estimated annual economic benefit (through improved employment and earnings and a reduction in public expenditure) of EUR 64 million. The monetary value of these benefits should not be summed, because the benefits overlap (for example, educational benefits will lead to an increase in the employment rate) and therefore summing the benefits would lead to double counting. The achieved benefits of Roma inclusion (some of which could be attributable to the introduction of the framework, particularly the educational benefits where the majority ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 157 of Roma inclusion spending has been targeted) are not as large as the level of expenditure on Roma inclusion in the Member States where both spending and benefit information is available, and in some Member States there are economic costs from the Roma population becoming less integrated despite interventions. This would indicate that funds are being inefficiently spent. However, the potential benefits which would from improving the educational and employment status of the Roma population to the level of the general population are much larger, and far outweigh the current levels of expenditure on Roma integration. Additionally, as all Member States still have the participation of the Roma population in education and employment below the general population level, spending targeting the Roma population should lead to long-term economic benefits. Improving the educational and employment status of this cohort of Roma will also lead to positive multiplier effects in future years, as the children of more educated and employed parents are more likely to be higher achievers in school and be in employment. Due to these large potential benefits and the potential multiplier effects, the level of expenditure on Roma integration is justified. Table 12 below presents a summary of the costs of EU and national funding on Roma inclusion and the potential benefits of closing the gap between Roma and non-Roma populations. ",

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 165 3.7 EU Added Value Key findings EU action is stimulating national actions in terms of fostering political will and ownership and is encouraging integrated and comprehensive policy approaches involving all relevant government levels and civil society representatives. In many countries (especially with a sizeable Roma population), this resulted in funding many Roma inclusion measures and ensuing achievements (e.g. integrated inclusion approaches, funding to specific inclusion measures, political focus on inclusion agenda). Here, the added value of the EU action has thus been high. Policy guidance, monitoring and reporting have also been useful to foster ownership, accountability and transparency of the policies implemented at the national level. In countries with less sizeable Roma population, the added value was lesser but still important to ensure the attention to the topic. EU action is still needed to promote Roma inclusion. There is a continued need to implement the current Framework, due to the complexity of the needs and challenges faced and the added value achieved through transnational exchanges of experience and practice. Discontinuing EU action would result in less of a policy focus on and available funding for Roma inclusion, as well as less monitoring and reporting of the situation. In the absence of the EU Framework, Member States (especially with a sizeable Roma population) would most likely have followed a different direction, or taken a different approach, which would not have achieved the same results. Having no EU Framework would lead to less of a policy focus on and a strong decrease of available funding for Roma inclusion, as well as less and looser monitoring and reporting on the Roma inclusion situation. Future improvements identified relate to the need to reduce the Member State over-reliance on EU funding, stronger incentives to implement the EU Framework, better use of the Structural Funds, more specific transnational knowledge exchange and more focussed and concrete policy guidance and monitoring. 3.7.1 To what extent is EU action necessary to stimulate, complement, leverage and create synergies with national action to promote Roma integration? The majority of sources reviewed as part of the current evaluation 671 confirmed that EU action was highly necessary to stimulate, complement, leverage and create synergies with national action to promote Roma integration. Overall, consensus emerged that the EU Framework and related actions was stimulating national action in a number of ways. In relation to the political aspect, evidence shows that in many countries, Roma inclusion issues are present in the national \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d because of the EU political agenda. 672 In this respect, the symbolic value of the EU Framework is indispensable as it gives the necessary impulse to discuss Roma issues across different contexts and among different stakeholders, giving the topic more visibility, especially among the political level and public authorities. The perspective of a multi-annual policy Framework also ensures a certain stability at the national level, 671 These include: literature review, Open Public Consultation, key stakeholder interviews at national level and European level, country case studies. 672 For instance, national-level interviews: BG1, BG7, SK1, RO1, IE1.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 166 especially in face of the changes of political priorities at the national level. 673 Country specific examples of such political impact are several. 674 This added value in terms of political visibility is also acknowledged in existing literature assessing the Roma inclusion agenda. For example, the March 2017 OSEPI report 675 found that the EU Framework has been the main driver forcing the governments of some EU Member States and the EU candidate and potential candidate countries to take action with respect to Roma integration. Similarly, the 2017 position paper 676 from the European Roma Information Office (ERIO) considers the EU Framework as having put Roma inclusion high on the EU political agenda. Similarly, this political added value was acknowledged in the stakeholder consultations during the evaluation. Many NGO participants in the stakeholder workshop stated that none of the Member States would be where they were now without the EU Framework as in many cases the EU pushed Roma to become a priority at EU, national and local level. 677 This was also confirmed in the national level interviews in several countries pointing to the importance of EU action in fostering political ownership and will to act on Roma inclusion. 678 Finally, the strategic importance of the EU Framework in terms of putting the Roma issue on the political agendas is also confirmed in the OPC results . A significant majority of the OPC respondents agreed that the EU Framework resulted in a series of achievements between 2011 and 2016 (see Figure). In particular, more than three- quarters of 242 OPC respondents recognised that, due to the EU Framework, Roma inclusion was put higher on the EU policy agenda and that more funding was earmarked 673 For example, In Slovakia, the Framework made the process of Roma inclusion less susceptible to political fluctuations and improved policy continuity. It made it more difficult to reverse policies driven by short-term political gain. Thanks to the pressure coming from the very existence of the Framework, the very existence of certain long-term challenges was admitted and a number of legislation changes were adopted. See country case study, section Added Value. 674 This includes for example: Austria, where the anchoring of the issue in the Federal Chancellery through the NRCP gives it a status it would not otherwise have had. In Germany, political discussions on Roma increased thanks to the official EU message on the topic. In Finland (a country with a less sizeable Roma population), the EU Framework has put pressure on the Finnish Ministries and authorities to focus more on Roma issues, which would otherwise have been overshadowed by other questions of national importance. In Italy, the EU Framework pushed for a paradigm shift and innovation in the national context. In the Netherlands, a Roma monitor based on indicators in the EU Recommendations is undertaken periodically and serves as an important source to track Roma inclusion and to facilitate the discussion. Romania, for which experts consider that even though the Member State has the necessary know how to develop policies in the field of Roma inclusion, in the absence of the EU Framework, there would have been less political awareness at the central and local government level. In Spain, according to most interviewees, the EU Framework has increased the visibility of problems faced by Roma both at national and EU level. In Sweden, the adoption of the EU Framework strengthened existing structures and improved reporting, funding, policy debates in Parliament. The enlargement countries credited the EU Framework for also putting a focus on Roma integration in Western European countries and Turkey, and not only the South-Eastern Member States and the Balkans as was the case in the pre-2011 period. 675 Open Society European Policy Institute, Report: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, 2017, https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/revisiting-eu-roma-framework-assessing-european- dimension-post-2020-future. 676 European Roma Information Office, ERIO Position Paper on the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and a post-2020 strategy as a contribution to the Mid-term review of the European Commission, 2017, http://cloud2.snappages.com/ecc3fa83da15cf423fe3aaa342f545fa355b24f3/ERIO%20position%20paper_Mi d-term%20assessment%20EU%20Framework_FINAL.pdf. 677 In the workshop discussion, an inquiry amongst all participants led to 97% percent agreeing that there is EU Added Value with regard to Roma inclusion in the Member States. 678 See BE1, BG6, BG8, DE1, FR2, HR1, IE1, LT1 (country with a less sizeable Roma population), NL1.

Table 39. The main achievements (in the 2011-2016 period) at European level Source: OPC responses, N=117. However, in some countries, the EU action has not achieved its intended impact in relation to furthering Roma inclusion issues in the political agenda. For example, the role of the EU Framework in influencing Czech Republic policies and practices towards Roma was not fully exploited. The Member State did not adopt a NRIS in line with EU Framework until 2015, four years after the Framework. 679 Similarly in France, stakeholders consulted during this study could not establish a direct causality link between the EU action and the developments in the French policy. The measures mostly originate from policy initiatives launched by France prior to the EU intervention. 680 Insights gained from interviews with national stakeholders in other countries suggest that in some cases the added value of the EU action has been modest due to the small numbers of Roma present. 681 In relation to the governance aspects, the EU action has added value in terms of: \uf09f Encouraging a move away from a compartmentalised approach to an integrated inclusion approach covering all core policy areas. 682 The holistic approach of the EU Framework allowed for wider issues and problems to be raised in relation to Roma, and to address their integration from various perspectives. Discussions of the issue at EU level showed the interrelations between the situation of Roma in across the Member States, as well as prompting a discussion about the 679 See country case study, section Added Value. 680 See country case study, section Added Value. 681 See national level interview: EE1, LV1. 682 See country case study in Austria, Spain, Italy, sections Added Value. 65,0% 65,8% 66,7% 69,2% 70,9% 71,8% 71,8% 72,6% 73,5% 73,5% 76,1% 78,6% 21,4% 21,4% 22,2% 16,2% 17,9% 17,1% 16,2% 16,2% 13,7% 16,2% 17,1% 14,5% 13,7% 12,8% 11,1% 14,5% 11,1% 11,1% 12,0% 11,1% 12,8% 10,3% 6,8% 6,8% Data collection/analysis of disaggregaated data on Roma by the FRA for evidence-based policymaking Annual assessment of policy implementation and guidance by EU Commission Development of EU level coordination structures Fighting anti-Roma hate speech and crime under FD combating racism and xenophobia All Member States have developed integrated strategies and policies Reform of mainstream policies through Roma CSR under ES and guiding use of ESIF Awareness raising on antidiscrimination through 2013 Council Recommendation Fighiting Roma discrimination through infringement proceedings under Racial Equality Dir.

Important in this respect is also the achievement to build the capacity of national, local and civil stakeholders. \uf09f Encouraging a more active involvement of the Roma population representatives in the policy and decision-making structures in the relevant policy areas directly affecting Roma. 685 The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has been fully aligned to the Framework objectives by generating evidence on living conditions and discrimination patterns, monitoring rights violations, sensitising the general public on issues of fundamental rights and discrimination and training and guiding public authorities and social actors in better implementing policies geared towards Roma integration. 686 Finally, the EU action had a clear monetary added value without which Member States would have implemented fewer measures and to a smaller extent on Roma inclusion. Various sources, such as the literature review, country analysis reports, and national level interviews, provide evidence that Member States alone would do much less towards the Roma inclusion or in a less integrated way. For many countries, much of the disbursements to Roma inclusion measures, and achievement that have come from this, have been due to EU funding and the financial added value of the EU Framework has therefore been high. The EU Framework brought added value by providing the Member States with different funding tools for implementing the NRIS and by conditioning funding. Evidence shows that EU funds have contributed to attracting money to Roma inclusion due to the need for co-funding (as confirmed in the majority of the country case studies ). 687 However, due to the lack of robust data tracking 683 See CS-AT, CS-ES, CS-EL, CS-IT; Section on EU Added Value. 684 See CS-ES, CS-IT; Section on EU Added Value. 685 For example, in Spain the EU framework has better articulated and reinforced the participation of the Roma population through the National Roma Council, see CS-ES; Section on EU Added Value. 686 See the web site of the Fundamental Rights Agency dedicated to Roma issues here fra.europa.eu/en/theme/roma/ 687 For example, in Austria, the EU action has allowed for targeted projects to be implemented at a (monetary) scale that far exceeded previous targeted projects, thus allowing for projects to be upscaled and greater numbers of Roma to be reached. In Bulgaria , the scale of the programmes especially in the areas of education and employment is unlikely to have been the same, as the one enabled via the EU funds. Also in Finland (a country with a less sizeable Roma population), the measures could not have been accomplished by Finland alone, without the support of EU structural funds, with the exception of the education measures carried out using Finnish State funds. Similarly in Greece , almost all measures in the areas of education, employment, housing, health and anti-discrimination (excluding those which aimed at combating poverty) are EU co-funded projects, the implementation of which would be difficult if these funds were not available, especially during a period of economic crisis and structural and financial adjustments. In Italy , without the EU framework there would be no NRIS, and without the NRIS the situation would be much more similar to the one registered in 2009 (IT-2, IT-3) and not a single action described in section three would have ever been implemented. For Spain, it is important to highlight that some of the new measures implemented or consolidated since the adoption of the NRIS are a result of having the possibility of co-funding by the ESF and ERDF but not so much a result of the NRIS. Some interviewees emphasize that the support of EU funding has been essential to carry out long-term and sustainable measures. In Slovakia, the monetary channel is the sheer financial resources from ESIFs devoted to Roma inclusion. The OP \u201cHuman Resources\u201d envisages a combined funding portfolio through priority Axes 5 and 6 of 450.1 Mil EUR. The exception to this trend are the Czech Republic and France where the measures have been either implemented to a low extent (Czech Republic) or via mostly with the national funds (France). See country studies, section EU Added Value. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 169 mechanisms, the stakeholder views cannot be confirmed by the analysis of data of funding allocated to Roma inclusion issues (see also section 3.4 Effectiveness). In some cases, it is reported that without the EU Framework, Member States would have acted in another way (going in different direction or with a different approach) and wouldn\u2019t have achieved the same results. For example, in Bulgaria, without the EU Framework, Bulgarian policy would have developed in the same direction according to the interviewed experts, but all of the progress would have come at a slower pace and there would have been no guarantees that some of those measures would have been able to occur. 688 In other cases, where specific Roma policies existed prior to the EU Framework, the EU Framework guided and focused these by identifying priorities, improving the planning and monitoring and strengthening the existing policies. For example, in Austria, the additional pressure imposed by the EU Framework allowed for measures to be upscaled and budgets to be secured from the EU Funds. 689 Findings from the literature review confirm this. For example, the 2017 UN OHCHR Lessons Learned report 690 considers the 2011 Framework as \u201cthe first large-scale EU policy in the area of Roma inclusion\u201d and finds that the very existence of the EU Framework as having engendered a range of positive measures at Member State level and indeed would not have occurred without EU support. The monetary added value is confirmed in the views of NGOs surveyed as part of this evaluation. Over half of the 65 NGOs agreed that the EU Framework has been necessary to stimulate both NRIS specific but also relevant measures at the national level across the relevant policy areas of employment, education, health, housing and anti-discrimination (see Annex 4). Over half of the NGO respondents also considered that the national funding alone was insufficient to address the needs of Roma in their country (see Annex 4). Similarly, around half of the 65 NGOs surveyed considered that the NRIS has helped to ensure the national funding for Roma integration to some extent, especially in the areas of education, healthcare, and equality (see Annex 4). In contrast, a more limited influence of the NRIS in ensuring such national funding was noted in the areas of housing and employment. The importance of EU funding provided to Roma inclusion is also confirmed through the OPC results and the stakeholder workshop. Just over half of the OPC respondents indicated that the NRIS in their respective country had influenced positively the level of funding allocated to Roma inclusion under ESIF 2014-2020. Similarly, more respondents agreed than disagreed that the NRIS in their respective country had positively influenced the level of funding allocated under ESIF 2014-2020 to finance mainstream policy reform around inclusiveness. Importantly, the response trends broken down by respondent type (public institutions, NGOs/think-tanks, citizens) or and country cluster (EU15, EU13, enlargement) were overall consistent with the overall response trends. In the stakeholder workshop , NGOs pointed at the stronger engagement of EU funds with Roma inclusion at the national level, thanks to the inclusion of a Roma specific priority in ESF, ex-ante conditionality of NRIS, and the active support of the EC representative in the Committees. They also agreed that EU funding made a very important contribution to National investment priorities. However, the monetary added value of the EU action also has a downside by potentially encouraging Member States to over-rely on EU funds to support Roma inclusion measures. Various reports and sources have pointed to the fact several 688 See country studies, section EU Added Value. 689 See country studies, section EU Added Value. 690 UN-OHCHR, Lessons Learned: Views in the Context of Mid-Term Review of Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2012-2020, 2017, http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/Lessons%20Learnt%20EU%20Framework%20for%20Natio nal%20Roma%20Integration%20Strategies%202012%202020.pdf.

ERIO (2017) even suggests the Commission has pressured Member States to allocate more EU funds for Roma policies \u201cand not redirect them to other communities or causes\u201d. 692 There are currently no mechanisms that encourage the Member States to become less dependent on the EU funding. 3.7.2 To what extent do the EU actions in areas such as monitoring, reporting, policy guidance, and knowledge exchange bring added value? 693 Various EU actions to support policy guidance, monitoring and reporting on the progress in Roma inclusion at the national level played an important role to foster national ownership, accountability and transparency of the policies implemented. This was positively assessed in the majority of sources reviewed to inform this evaluation. In the literature review , for example, the 2016 Commission report assessing the implementation of the EU framework 694 pointed out the 2015 guidance provided by Commission experts on how the 2014-2020 ESIF can be used to tackle Roma educational and spatial segregation as important for fighting discrimination and segregation. The positive added value of monitoring and reporting was also highlighted in several country contexts . 695 Stakeholders interviewed at national and EU levels also pointed at the added value of the EU Framework\u2019s policy guidance, monitoring and reporting arrangements(in particular the annual Member State reports on the implementation of the NRISs) . 696 This is the case in particular when the policy guidance is sufficiently detailed and targeted to the national context. The annual nature of monitoring and reporting exercises allowed to take stock on a regular basis (with the benefits of multi-annual reporting also being considered, see section 3.6.1). 697 The annual Member State reports on the implementation of the NRISs also allow easier comparisons with other EU countries 698 .

The sharing and learning does happen, especially at the following institutional levels: \uf09f regular meetings of the National Roma Contact Points; \uf09f the EURoma network with NRCP and managing authorities; \uf09f the Roma Platform for civil society consultations. But the knowledge exchange does not occur on a systematic and holistic basis, as it often based on already pre-existing contacts and natural exchange counterparts.

Finnish stakeholders have also been in contact when developing services for Roma migrants with the other Nordic countries, such as Sweden and Norway. 711 Lithuania sometimes shares best practices with other Baltic countries \u2013 e.g., Latvia \u2013 about the implementation of Roma projects (all countries with a less sizeable Roma populations). 712 Poland introduced and developed solutions proven in other countries (e.g. Roma education assistants, scholarship system for Roma students) and is sharing its own experience in the Framework of thematic visits of the Council of Europe CAHROM. 713 Improvements identified in this regard relate to: \uf09f The need to ensure that the NRCPs actively support bilateral and other types of exchanges between the stakeholders within the country and transnationally, and cascade such information on a systematic basis to the national stakeholders. 714 \uf09f Exploiting better the work of the EU Roma Platform, meetings of the national contact points and maximising the interaction with MEPs, 715 as well as further utilising the capacity building opportunities by FRA and existing European Commission \u2013 Council of Europe joint programmes (JUSTROM, ROMACT, ROMED, ROMACTED, INSCHOOL). 3.7.3 To what extent does Roma inclusion continue to require EU level action? Given the relatively slow pace of the implementation of the NRIS at the national level (see also section 3.3), Roma inclusion still needs to be guided by EU action. Considering the types and complexities of the inclusion challenges, effectively addressing them requires some form of EU coordination/monitoring (despite relatively low EU competences in some of the key inclusion policy areas such as housing), also to maintain the momentum generated so far by the NRIS implementation. A number of sources confirm these conclusions, for example several country case studies concluded that the continuation of the EU Framework was absolutely necessary in order to achieve sustainable effects. 716 An important aspect relates to the cross-national nature of the Roma inclusion problems and solutions required. The EU-wide work on Roma inclusion has shown that issues concerning Roma (e.g. education, history of persecution) are similar in several Member States, making EU action both relevant and necessary. 717 Furthermore, also for a majority of the OPC respondents , the EU has a major role to play in supporting national, regional and local authorities to design and implement public policies aimed at improving the situation of Roma. Almost 60% of the 242 respondents thought that the situation of Roma could not be effectively improved without EU policy support, this was equally the case among the responding public institutions, NGOs/think-tanks and citizens. The main reason given is that the EU funding programmes and initiatives, including in terms of monitoring the Roma situation, are 708 See CS-SK, section on EU Added Value. 709 See national-level interview: CZ8. 710 See national-level interview: EE1. 711 See national-level interview:FI7. 712 See national-level interview: LT1. 713 See national-level interview: PL1. 714 See Austria, Italy country case reports, section added value.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 173 critical to drive the necessary reform and secure political commitment at the national level 718 .The NGO survey revealed another important reason for the continuation of the EU action, relating to the lack of sufficient funding at the national level to address the Roma needs, considered to be the case by over 60% of NGO respondents (see Annex 4, n=65). In this sense, the added value of EU funding helps to address the national funding gap (see also section 3.5.1). 3.7.4 What would be the consequences of stopping targeted EU action? Overall, consensus prevails that stopping the targeted EU action on Roma inclusion would result in less of a policy focus on and a strong decrease of available funding for Roma inclusion, as well as less and looser monitoring and reporting of the situation. This is confirmed by the evidence gathered though the case studies, stakeholder workshop discussion, national and EU level interviews and NGO survey . A number of country case studies confirm the likely detrimental consequences of discontinuing EU action in terms of fewer measures funded and less focus on the Roma inclusion as an important policy issue. 719 . In the stakeholder workshop , several stakeholders also argued that EU action cannot be stopped in the post-2020 period, because that would generate a significant backslide . Participants also considered that discontinuing the EU Framework would jeopardise its current achievements, especially in terms of political emphasis of the issues at the agendas at the European, national and local levels, offering guidance to Member States, in what should be prioritised and offering platforms to bring all stakeholders together, CSOs, government representatives, Member States and enlargement countries. The national level interviews also revealed that stopping EU action would result in an approach to Roma inclusion which would be less comprehensive, coordinated and narrower in scope. 720 In addition, the scope and scale of existing measures would be narrowed down, reaching fewer beneficiaries, 721 and the resources and political will available to fund innovative activities or try new solutions would be smaller. 722 Other expected downsides would be a move backwards towards small-scale, short-term projects and initiatives and away from trying to implement long-term initiatives or structural results in the long-term. 723 Importantly, the political attention on Roma inclusion issues may be reduced as there would be no basis for monitoring 724 . Roma inclusion would be more dependent on the nature of the political party in power and its priorities. 725 The coordination approach involving not only national but also regional and local authorities would also lessen and diminish. 726 The majority of 65 NGOs surveyed for the evaluation also maintained that without the EU action the results achieved at the national level for Roma integration would have been fewer (see Annex 4). This importance of the EU Framework in 718 Most frequent response to Q3.2 \"Please explain your choice\" (i.e. answer to Q3.1) 719 In Greece, for example, the EU level action has contributed substantially to the implementation of relevant measures, especially through the allocation of EU funds under the NSRF 2007-2013 and NSRF 2014-2020. The lack of EU funding would most likely not lead to a discontinuation of the efforts made, but it would result probably in the implementation of fewer interventions for the promotion of Roma inclusion, with lower budgets and targeting thus a smaller number of beneficiaries. 719 Similarly in Spain, there is a dominating perception amongst stakeholders that measures would not be totally discontinued, as many actions implemented are part of the Spanish social protection system, however such actions would likely be reduced in intensity and lead to weaker results, See respective country case reports, section added value. 720 See national level interview CZ9. 721 See national level interview CZ4, AT11, ES2, ES10, EUI1, FI2, HR1, IE4, LT1, PT4, SK8, RO1, UK1. 722 See national level interview CZ4, 723 See national level interview BE4, ES1. 724 See national level interviews DE3, FR6, IE4, NL1. 725 See national level interview SI1. 726 See national level interview ES10.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 174 achieving the results would be thus jeopardised if the Framework is to be discontinued after 2020. 3.8 Sustainability Key findings Three types of measures can ensure the sustainability of the results in the post-2020 era: (i) funding mix between EU and national investment; (ii) mainstreaming Roma integration issues into policy-making in various areas to ensure that they recognise the needs of both Roma and non-Roma; and (iii) involvement of Roma in the decision-making process. Whilst in principle commitment to each one of these measures in strong, in practice the sustainability of the Framework in the post-2020 era is questioned for three main reasons. First, continuity of funding for initiatives in the post-2020 period is not yet guaranteed. Second, guaranteeing continuation of programmes and projects requires a longer timeframe. Third, existing mechanisms are still in the process of consolidation and might become symbolic rather than integral in the policy-making process if the framework does not continue. This does not mean that none of the benefits will be sustainable in the future. Benefits in education and, to an extent, in employment, are more likely to last as they are part of a cultural change at individual and community level. Changes in other areas though would need more time and resources to bring log-term results. A mechanism is also needed to ensure a sustainability check at policy implementation level. The assessment of sustainability considers the extent to which the effects of the EU Framework are likely to last in the post-2020 period. 3.8.1 What measures were adopted by the European Commission and the Member State to ensure the sustainability of the results of the policy actions implemented within the scope of the NRIS / EU Framework (both at planning and implementation stage)? Three types of measures can ensure the sustainability of the results in the post-2020 era: First a right funding mix between EU funding and national investment, together with private funding, ensures the continuation of programmes geared towards combatting discrimination and fostering integration. Second, mainstream public services become more inclusive and barriers to accessing them are identified and removed. Third, empowerment of Roma leads to a continued effort by public, private and non- government actors to advance in Roma inclusion. As a first dimension, the need for sustainable funding is emphasized in policy documents and reports produced by EU institutions 727 . The EU Framework states that Member States should allocate sufficient funding from national budgets, which can be supplemented, where appropriate, with EU and international funding 728 . An independent evaluation 727 For instance: European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Report on the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2015\u2019, COM (2015) 299 final.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 175 requested by the EP in 2015 729 noted that co-funding approaches are critical to the sustainability of the interventions to support Roma inclusion. Specifically, the evaluation recommended putting in place funding streams from the EU and other international sources to complement contributions from the Member States (including from the public, NGO and private organisations). The Mid-term review carried out by the Commission in 2017 stressed that financing up to 2020 is a high priority 730 . The annual Communications from the Commission stress the need to involve regional and local authorities as well as private stakeholders to achieve sustainable funding 731 . The European Roma Information Office (ERIO) also stressed that the European Commission should pressure the Member States to allocate more EU funds towards the implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategies, as well as that the European Commission should provide guidance as to how EU funds may be utilised 732 . The importance of sustainable funding was also almost unanimously expressed in interviews by stakeholders representing different organizations across Member States and enlargement countries. Sustainable funding is understood as funding to which European, national and local levels of governance contribute to a different degree (e.g. 70-20-10) to achieve commonly agreed goals. In practice though, questions were raised about the extent to which resources allocated to support the implementation of the Framework are sustainable in the long-term 733 . The 2012 and 2013 reports from the Commission underlined that some Member States did not earmark sufficient funds for Roma integration policies 734 . Regarding EU funds alone, 12 Member States earmarked \u20ac1.5 billion (3.5% of the total allocation for social inclusion) to Roma integration 735 . In the case of enlargement countries, the Mid-term review also highlights the need for the allocation of more national funding 736 .

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 176 OSEPI Institute report suggested that the Framework encouraged the use of national funding for implementing measures supporting Roma inclusion but also underlined that Member States relied to a large extent on European funding in the implementation of the NRIS. The activities carried out are thus subject to the level of funds in the next programming period and may be interrupted in the transition between funding periods 737 . The lack of national or local funding to support the long-term sustainability of measures was also confirmed in stakeholder interviews and in several country case studies (e.g. Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, France and Greece). The second measure to ensure continuity and sustainability is mainstreaming Roma integration in general education, employment, housing and health programmes. This requires that Roma are beneficiaries of the general policies, including lowering their specific barrier to access public services and opportunities as well as compensating for disadvantages. This perspective of making mainstream services inclusive can contribute to the continuation of the measures in the future (even if specific strategies on Roma inclusion are discontinued). The benefits of mainstreaming measures to support Roma integration in general education, employment, housing and health programmes are discussed also in country case studies. For example, in Bulgaria, two mainstream national educational policies guaranteed the sustainability of the Roma integration process in education 738 . Making two years of pre-school education mandatory and organising full-day learning activities (including free textbooks and meals) were aimed at all children of school age, including Roma children aged 4 to 15. Interviewers argued that early participation in education brought long-term effects as it played an important role in the social and psychological development of the child and encouraged participation in later stages of education 739 . In Greece, a mainstream national policy that provided health coverage to uninsured brought significant benefits to Roma as they were overrepresented in the group of uninsured who gained access to healthcare. The benefits of mainstream measures are more extensively addressed under \u2018coherence\u2019 (see Section 3.3 above). A third measure to ensure the sustainability of the results related to the engagement with 1) Roma communities and the CSOs that support them; and 2) Regional and local authorities. The annual Communications from the European Commission stress the need to involve civil society to sustain measures targeting Roma communities and recommends that the involvement of civil society extend across all stages including the design of measures, their implementation and the monitoring and evaluation 740 .

The Mid-term review also highlighted this need in the enlargement countries 742 . Effective engagement of civil society organisations can help to identify funding priorities, 743 empower local communities, provide critical feedback and increase accountability in the implementation of Roma inclusion policies. However, to make community engagement effective there is a need to build the capacity of local CSOs to support integrated local action plans 744 . Despite the importance that has been placed to community engagement, stakeholder interviews and the literature review suggested that to date there are no significant efforts to provide support to build capacity of Roma grassroots organizations and community groups, a factor that, in practice, is reducing their participation 745 , an issue that has been raised by the UN OHCHR, ERIO 746 , the Irish Immigrant Support Centre 747 and the OSEPI 748 amongst others.

To increase effective participation of Roma communities and the sustainability of the results, there is also a need to build the administrative capacity of local authorities with regards to anti-Roma discrimination 750 .

Some efforts have already been carried out in this regard, with local authorities (under the \u2018for Roma with Roma\u2019 transnational campaign); joint programmes with the Council of Europe (e.g. ROMACT, ROMED and ROMATED programmes); and networks of transnational cooperation between authorities at national and local level, as well as Roma NGOs 752 ( for more information see \u2018Coordination\u2019 Section 3.5 above). 3.8.2 What measures were adopted to ensure the continuity of the activities carried out thanks to the EU funding? Country analysis and stakeholder interviews suggested that Member States have taken limited measures to ensure the continuity of the activities carried out with EU funding. As indicated in Section 3.7.1 above, whilst sustainable funding is a high priority at a policy level, in practice Member States relied to a large extent on European funding in the implementation of the NRIS, and continuity of activities has not been guaranteed after the EU funding stops. 3.8.3 Are there any mechanisms in place to ensure a sustainability check at policy implementation level? Regular monitoring and periodic evaluations are the main mechanisms in place to ensure a sustainability check at policy implementation level. While in principle both Member States and the Commission have reporting obligations about the implementation of the framework, in practice there are no mechanisms in place to ensure a sustainability check at policy implementation level because of data and information gaps.

An evaluation commissioned by the EP in 2015 755 noted that almost none of the MS provided details regarding progress in the implementation of the Strategy and, wherever references were made, targets, baselines and indicators set by the majority of the Member States were generally poor while the monitoring mechanisms were weak 756 . Reporting and Monitoring mechanisms established were not sufficient in evaluating the effects of activities undertaken as part of the strategies. Another weakness of the existing monitoring mechanisms was that Roma communities had limited involvement in the monitoring of Roma-focused projects, measuring discrimination and determining the degree to which mainstream services are responsive and accessible to Roma needs 757 . The situation has gradually improved in response to the introduction of ex-ante conditionalities in the EU funds 758 . In its Mid-term review of 2017 759 , the Commission stated that in the future, national strategies should focus on \u201ca limited number of critical areas and targets, allowing for the combined use and aligned monitoring of targeted and mainstream policy, legal and funding tools\u201d. The Commission considers that a greater impact can be achieved by defining \u201cspecific national quantitative targets with indicators for selected inclusive reforms and major targeted interventions under each area\u201d (education, employment, health and housing) 760 .

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 180 3.8.4 To what extent are the outcomes/benefits of the policies implemented via the NRIS and EU Framework expected to continue post 2020? Stakeholder consultations suggested that the long-term sustainability of the outcomes will be questioned if the EU Framework does not continue after 2020 as established mechanisms have not been fully institutionalised and funding has not been guaranteed for the post-2020 period. In education, and to an extent employment, the results are more likely to be sustainable, as they based in a longer-term cultural change at individual and community level. This would not be the case though with policies and measures introduced in housing and health. Whilst some mechanisms are in place and have been institutionalised, they are still in the process of consolidation and need a longer timeframe to become an integral part of the policy-making processes. Many interviewees, including NRCP representatives, have stressed that most of the current national policies and structures created around the NRIS (NRCP, systems of coordination, monitoring and reporting, events, systems of consultation to the civil society and Roma organisations) would stop or would be less operational and more symbolic, if the EU framework does not continue after 2020 763 . There is the need for more time to ensure greater sustainability and long-term impact of policies in place and for the consolidation of working structures at both EU and national level. Consolidation will depend on their legitimation, which will in turn depend on effectiveness in achieving tangible results, and effectiveness will be related to consistency and available means. Depending on the initiatives, positive effects may continue in some areas as they have brought cultural changes at individual and community level. This is the case for example in both mainstream and targeted measures in education. Stakeholder interviews suggested that improvements in Roma participation in ECEC, compulsory secondary school attendance and decreasing secondary school drop-outs are expected to continue in the coming years. Increasing Roma parents\u2019 commitment towards education and the openness of the educational system supports this positive trend. If the NRISs were discontinued there would be the risk that some programmes with positive impact would stop, for example programmes aimed at supporting the school system process (monitoring attendance, involvement of families, supporting homework, etc.) but some of the long-term effects of the programmes were expected to continue. The long-term effects of educational measures due to cultural change were discussed in case study reports (e.g. Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland) as well as in workshop participants that was held Brussels in March 2018. The \u2018Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma Communities\u2019 also confirmed the finding that interventions that led to institutionalisation and changing cultural attitudes were more likely to promote sustainability 764 . The most promising example was observed in Serbia where education sector interventions were institutionalised 765 . The long-term benefits of initiatives in other areas such as health and housing are more questionable as initiatives are usually short-term, ad hoc and have not brought the institutional or cultural changes that are required to be sustainable in the future. The \u2018Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma Communities\u2019 found that in employment the sustainability of interventions was minimal. In housing, the evaluation found that more time was needed to determine the sustainability of alternative models (e.g. \u2018village 763 As documented in country studies and interviews. 764 EPRD, 2015 \u2018Thematic Evaluation on IPA Support to Roma Communities\u2019: http://www.evropa.gov.rs/Documents/Home/DACU/12/193/Thematic%20Evaluation%20on%20IPA%20Sup port%20to%20Roma%20Communities%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf. 765 Ibid.

Similar conclusions were reached about the sustainability of housing and health initiatives in the Bulgarian, French and Greek country case studies. To guarantee the long-term benefits of programmes and projects a longer timeframe is required. Many programmes and projects initiated prior to the EU framework were only short-term and relied on annual extensions, with interruptions in some cases. There is a lack of consolidation of these funds in the institutional budget, consequently they are developed as transitory projects rather than long-term and sustainable programmes. Changes in political leadership, new priorities or budget constraints put the sustainability of such programmes at risk. This view was clearly expressed also by respondents to the NGO survey as indicated in Table 36. Table 40.

The end of ESIF would result in the discontinuation of many programmes if there is not continuity in the next programming period. In the countries where more Roma are living, many programmes and projects are highly dependent on ESF and in some cases on ERDF and EAFRD, with more cases only co-funded by national budget to a small extent (around 20%). Several interviewees have reported that most of the new initiatives addressing Roma inclusion have come as a result of the EU framework and its support by ESIF (especially ESF) and would not be continued if there were to be a discontinuation EU funding. 766 Ibid.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 182 3.9 Equity Key findings The EU Frameworks aims at ensuring social inclusion and equality of treatment of all Roma. The analysis focuses on three main sub-groups: women, children and youth; to the extent possible, reference is also made other sub-groups, such as Roma migrants and EU mobile Roma, LGBT, elderly, or disabled. The assessment suggests that the EU Framework addresses the different needs of vulnerable subgroups within the Roma population only to a limited extent and would benefit from a much stronger focus on multiple and intersectional discrimination. Despite increasing focus at EU level on the fight against discrimination and anti-Gypsyism, awareness raising activities implemented in several countries appear insufficient to halt and break down the rising levels of discrimination and anti-Gypsyism throughout the EU. Assessing the proportionality of funding distribution among Roma and other vulnerable groups, or the extent to which mainstream and (non-Roma specific) targeting programmes are available to Roma, proves very difficult in the face of the limited availability of analysis and evidence at national level. Sources suggest that the absence of indicators, targets, timelines and disaggregated data limit the EU Framework\u2019s progress in achieving equity. 3.9.1 Has there been sufficient level of awareness raising efforts for fighting discrimination and addressing anti-Gypsyism In its 2011 Communication on the EU Framework, the European Commission called on Member States to prioritise stepping up their efforts in the fight against discrimination, including multiple discrimination, and racism 767 . The 2013 Council recommendation increased attention on anti-discrimination , which was mentioned as one of the main achievements of the EU Framework at EU level by over 69% respondents to the OPC . The evidence suggests, however, that awareness raising activities have not been implemented in all countries and that they have not been effective in those countries where they were implemented. Awareness raising measures have been implemented in several countries on general Roma issues 768 or specifically on discrimination this population group faces 769 . In Finland , for instance, activities focus on sensitising Roma on the existence of multiple discrimination and Roma NGOs to encourage them to recognise and fight multiple discrimination 770 . In Portugal , one of the activities consisted in distributing leaflets on fighting discrimination in schools 771 . In other countries, including in the enlargement region, such activities are planned 772 . Despite these efforts, Roma remain the most discriminated population group in Europe today 773 . Several sources point out that discrimination and anti-Gypsyism, including hate crime and harassment of Roma, remain major issues in all areas and this in all the 767 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, National Roma Integration Strategies: a first step in the implementation of the EU Framework\u2019, COM (2012) 226 final, p. 13. 768 CY1; DE3; EE2; PT1; PT2; PT3; SE3; WB2. 769 CS-FI, CS-PT, BE2, HR2, IE5, NL5, IE2, IE5, NH4, PT1, SE2. 770 CS-FI ; FI1. 771 CS-PT. 772 PL1; WB8 (Bosnia and Herzegovina). 773 EUI3 ; EUI8.

While Roma issues have been put on the agenda and are better understood across countries since the adoption of the EU Framework, such awareness does not necessarily result in goodwill and motivation to take action 775 . The majority of the OPC respondents identify rising discrimination and anti-Gypsyism as main challenges to Roma inclusion at both the EU and national level 776 . Most of them consider that there is \u201clittle awareness among the majority about the Roma equality and the mutual benefits of Roma integration\u201d. In this sense, some of the stakeholders at national level complain that awareness raising efforts are not continuous 777 , that more needs to be done 778 or that the connection between the awareness raising efforts and the EU Framework is not clear 779 . In some cases, interviewees reported that no activities on awareness raising were planned in the implementation of the EU Framework in their country, be it on Roma issues in general 780 , or specifically on discrimination against Roma 781 . At least two of the key documents from civil society on anti-Gypsyism stress the problem of institutional discrimination that reproduces existing patterns of disadvantage 782 . Additionally, an EU level interviewee explained that anti-Gypsyism has many more manifestations than discrimination, including hate speech, hate crime and access to justice 783 . According to several NGO participants to the Workshop , anti-Gypsyism is, with some limited and partial exceptions, generally not recognised or tackled as a specific forum of racism by countries, institutions, legislation or policies. Whereas official EU documents now refer to anti-Gypsyism as a special form of racism, this seems to have had only limited impact at the national level. In fact, most OPC respondents (a little of two-thirds) agree \u201cthat the fight against anti-Gypsyism is today stronger at EU level than in their respective country\u201d. This situation explains that calls are made to provide a bigger focus on anti- discrimination and anti-Gypsyism in the EU Framework , which would need to include awareness-raising measures 784 , particularly so on the particular situation of the youth and women 785 as well as on institutional racism 786 . 774 OPC ; CS-SK; EUI3 ; EUI7. 775 EUI5. 776 When asked whether rising discrimination and anti-Gypsyism was a main challenge (in the 2011-2016 period) in respect of Roma main challenges inclusion at the European level (Q11.1), 86.3% of the respondents rather agreed, 10.3% rather disagreed, and 3.4% did not have an opinion.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 184 3.9.2 How proportional has the available funding been distributed among interventions benefiting Roma and other vulnerable groups? This evaluation question closely relates to evaluation questions discussed in previous sections, including Section 3.3 on Coherence), Section 3.4 on Effectiveness and Section 3.5 on Efficiency. As was explained in those Sections, the analysis conducted within the framework of the mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 found that the funding sources generally failed to make a strong reference to the Roma, thereby hindering the investigation into the proportionality of funding distribution among interventions benefiting Roma and other vulnerable groups. Information on funding for vulnerable groups was not collected and questions cannot be answered in a comprehensive manner. 3.9.3 To what extent do the Framework and the National Roma Integration Strategies address the risk of multiple discrimination among Roma? The EU Framework and the NRIS address the risk of multiple discrimination among Roma only to a limited extent. EU Framework Despite the European Parliament\u2019s call to ensure protection of vulnerable subgroups and to include the fight against multiple and intersectional discrimination in the objectives 787 , the 2011 EU Framework does not address the risk of multiple discrimination among Roma, but rather marginally refers to a few vulnerable subgroups\u2019 specific issues, including Roma children\u2019s access to education and Roma women and children\u2019s access to healthcare 788 . The 2011 EU Framework fails to include a separate and detailed gender awareness section, mentioning gender merely three times. That being said, over 69% of respondents to the OPC noted the increased attention on the protection of Roma women following the 2013 Council Recommendation as one of the main achievements at EU level. The 2011 EU Framework also mentions young Roma only a few times, including when describing the higher share of people under 15 among Roma (35.7%) compared to the overall EU population (15.7%) and in relation to education 789 . The EU Framework currently misses a specific focus on youth 790 . While recognizing the heterogeneity of Roma communities, the 2011 EU Framework also mentions: i. \u2018mobile Roma communities with citizenship of the country or of another EU country\u2019; ii. \u2018mobile and sedentary Roma communities who are third-country nationals, refugees, stateless persons or asylum seekers\u2019. The Framework fails to identify the specificity of Roma who are EU mobile citizens (only partly included in point i., together with mobile domestic or autochthonous Roma) and lacks a focus on Roma migrants 791 . However, there is evidence showing that recently arrived Roma migrants 787 European Parliament, Resolution of 9 March 2011 on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion, P7_TA(2011)0092, par. 68, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=- //EP//NONSGML+TA+P7-TA-2011-0092+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN. 788 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Midterm review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies\u2019 COM (2017) 458 final, available at https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2017/EN/COM-2017-458-F1-EN- MAIN-PART-1.PDF?utm_source=WHO%2FEurope+mailing+list&utm_campaign=b5f24dc0b4- EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_10_23&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_60241f4736-b5f24dc0b4-110535997. 789 European Commission, \u2018Communication on an EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020\u2019, COM (2011) 0173 final. 790 EUI3. 791 There is no common definition of Roma migrants or EU mobile Roma across Member States.

Like any newly arrived in a given country, they are not \u2018accustomed to the given society, the labour market and the services available to them\u2019, they might be faced with language barriers and have difficulties in accessing public services meant only for residents 792 . Country studies confirm the high level of discrimination faced by Roma migrants and EU mobile Roma for being Roma and migrants at the same time, their precarious living conditions, and issues related to their residence status 793 . For example, in France, Roma migrants (including EU mobile Roma) have often faced hardship in respect to evictions. Until 2014, also those with EU citizenship experienced difficulties in obtaining a residence permit and, thus, a work permit 794 ; although all the restrictions were lifted in 2014 and both Romanian and Bulgarian citizens were free to work in France, migrant Roma have been living suffering difficulties in all areas 795 . In this overall context, several interviews with stakeholders have highlighted the concerns related to Roma migrants and the need to recognise it as a specific area of action of the EU Roma Framework 796 . The majority of OPC respondents (between 63% and 73%) identified the insufficient focus on gender mainstreaming, Roma youth empowerment and mobile Roma moving within the EU as some of the main challenges of the EU Framework. During the EU level scoping interviews 797 as well as during the workshop discussions 798 , the need for the EU Framework to focus more on intersectionality 799 was stressed to ensure that all Roma subgroups are included in the EU Framework. National Roma Integration Strategies The situation and needs of Roma subgroups at risk of social exclusion and marginalisation are insufficiently addressed at national level 800 . The results of the OPC minority \u2013 also known as \u2018domestic Roma\u2019, they are historic communities with the same rights as the majority population\u2019; Roma who recently immigrated coming from the new EU member states \u2013 \u2018recently arrived\u2019 Roma with EU citizenship rights, also known as \u2018 EU mobile citizen Roma \u2019; Roma who migrated from former Yugoslavia in the 1990s \u2013 non-EU citizens who, in the meantime, became long-term residents (EUROCITIES (2017), Roma Inclusion in cities - Mapping of the situation of Roma in cities in Europe). In our report, we refer to two categories: 1. Roma migrants, intended as Roma who are non-EU citizens (regardless of the length of stay and the acquisition of the long-term residence status); 2. EU mobile Roma are Roma with citizenship of another Member State. The sources consulted and the interviews do not always distinguish between these two categories, but refer to \u2018Roma migrants\u2019 as including both the categories. 792 EUROCITIES (2017), Roma Inclusion in cities - Mapping of the situation of Roma in cities in Europe. 793 CS-AT and CS-FR. 794 Following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU, France and 18 other Member States had restricted access to the labour market for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.

The evidence from the 11 country studies and the targeted stakeholder consultations in other countries, seems to suggest that slightly more countries do capture multiple discrimination issues in their NRIS 801 , than those that do not 802 . The extent to which they do include them varies from a very limited focus on multiple discrimination in Slovenia 803 , to a reasonable coverage in Ireland 804 , and an extensive focus in Bulgaria. A focus on multiple discrimination issues in the NRIS does not necessarily reflect in the measures that are being implemented, as is for instance the case in Belgium 805 . On the other hand, in some countries where multiple discrimination is missing from the NRIS, programmes sometimes do focus on the specific needs of vulnerable subgroups, be it to a limited extent 806 . The country studies and the targeted stakeholder consultations suggest that whenever special attention is given to vulnerable Roma subgroups at national level, Roma children, youth, and women are most likely to be included 807 , and Roma with disabilities to a much lesser extent 808 . Various sources , including the workshop , the country studies and stakeholders interviewed at national leve l, indicate that several other subgroups currently receive only very little and insufficient attention , if any at all, in the EU Framework and at national level, including the situation and needs of Roma migrants 809 , LGBTI Roma 810 , and Muslim Roma 811 , as well as the distinction between urban and rural Roma 812 . Regarding Roma migrants or EU mobile Roma, these sub-groups are targeted by mainstream policies , addressed to all migrants. For example, in Germany , no distinction is drawn between migrants on the basis of their national or ethnic origin. Thus, there are no specific integration measures for migrant Roma 813 . Similar approaches have been taken in the other Member States. In France , some measures address Roma migrants and EU mobile Roma only as part of interventions related to camps 814 . While such a mainstreaming approach allows Roma to access relevant services addressed to migrants, it also implies that Roma migrants or EU mobile Roma \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, National Roma Integration Strategies: a first step in the implementation of the EU Framework\u2019, COM (2012) 226 final, p. 13. 801 Including BE, BG, EL, FI, HR; HU; IE; RO; SE; SI; former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 802 Including DE; FR; IT; NL; PT; SK; UK. 803 SI1. 804 IE5. 805 BE2. 806 CS-SK. 807 CS-BG ; CS-EL; CS-FI ; CS-HU ; CS-RO ; CS-SK; HR2; SE2. 808 CS-BG; CS-FI; HR2. 809 Two NRCP participants to the workshop; CS-FR; CS-ES; CS-FI; WB6 (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). 810 CS-SK. 811 IE5; SE2.

S everal sources point to the importance of reliable, disaggregated data and evidence for the development of a more diversified approach to Roma inclusion in policies at different levels as well as for the analysis of the differential impacts of projects on various subgroups 816 . 3.9.4 To what extent do the Framework results address the specific needs of Roma women? Considering the lack of a gender perspective and consistent consideration of gender issues in the EU Framework and most NRIS, the Framework results address the specific needs of Roma women only to a very limited extent. Various stakeholders interviewed at EU level highlight the absence of a gender perspective in the EU Framework and call for a stronger focus on Roma women (see Section 3.2 on Relevance). Roma women and girls make up a vulnerable subgroup given the multiple discrimination they face based on their ethnic origin and their gender in the areas of education, health, employment, housing, discrimination and rights awareness, trafficking in human beings, marriage, voting and political participation 817 . As a result, Roma women often find themselves in an overall worse socio-economic situation compared to not only Roma men but also to non-Roma women 818 . Certain groups of Roma women, including Roma women with disabilities, elderly Roma women, single Roma mothers, and Roma widows with dependent children, face extreme vulnerability to social exclusion and marginalisation 819 . Gender differences are noticeable among Roma regarding employment, and to a lesser extent in health (self-reported health situation) and education (early school leaving)\u2014 (see table below). The differences, between Roma men and women have not changed (in terms of statistical significance of the data) between 2011 and 2016, except in respect to employment: the gap with Roma men was of 18 percentage points in 2016 against 11 points in 2011 (34% of Roma men declared to have \u201cpaid work\u2019 in 2016 against 31% in 2011). In addition, the gender gap on the share of young persons (16- 24 years old) with current main activity neither in employment, education or training, increased from 11 points (62% of Roma women versus 51% of men) in 2011 to 17 815 EUI4, CS-AT. 816 CS-BG; Several NGO participants to the workshop, including from the enlargement countries; NRCP participant from an enlargement country; UNICEF: Child rights in Central and Eastern Europe and central Asia (issue 2, 2014).

Of these seven, three were part of the selection of the country studies 823 and further examination showed that they all lacked explicit measures for women outside of a single policy area (e.g. health in the case of Slovakia, or education in the case of Greece). Furthermore, the absence of an explicit gender focus in the EU Framework has translated into the NRIS lacking indicators and targets to tackle Roma women\u2019s specific situation as well as is a lack of (political) commitment at the national level to take a more proactive approach to addressing gender needs 824 . Many NRIS either take a gender-neutral approach 825 or they lack explicit gender measures in nearly all areas except for health 826 . While the inclusion of references to gender equality and women\u2019s rights can be found in most NRIS , little appears to be done in terms of implementation . The Workshop Discussions confirm that, when in place, gender mainstreaming measures often remain ineffective 827 . Moreover, in the few NRIS where the specific situation of Roma women is considered, no specific measures, deadlines and resources are included to tackle those specific challenges 828 . Literature suggests that all sections of the NRIS\u2019 annual monitoring should include a women\u2019s rights and gender equality perspective 829 . Figure 12, taken from the NGO survey , demonstrates that the needs of Roma women remain largely unmet.

Source: NGO Survey While the extent of the Framework results to address the specific needs of Roma women seems largely limited, the interviews conducted in the 16 countries not covered by the case studies offer some interesting examples . For example, in Sweden , women are a special target group whose needs are considered separately in health, access to social services, and civil society participation 832 . As proof of this, more than 50% of complaints to the Swedish Ombudsman were lodged by Roma women 833 . In Portugal , it was noted that women themselves are the drivers of change and that specific policy measures addressing women\u2019s needs have been implemented, such as through the OPRE programme 834 . In general, the reviewed literature suggests that health mediators have been especially effective for support access to healthcare for women and girls 835 . At EU level, it should be mentioned that the EC and the Council of Europe put in place in 2016 a joint programme to improve the access to justice of Roma and Traveller women (JUSTROM) in five Member States (Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Romania) 836 . In addition, while the literature merely generally stresses the need to pay special attention to the gender dimension when adopting an integration approach to Roma inclusion 837 , the 2015 evaluation on IPA support to Roma communities mentions it specifically in relation to housing in the enlargement countries 838 . In fact, some enlargement countries also provide a positive example, not only in housing, such as in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia where, the National Plan for strengthening the position of Roma women includes the goal of Roma women and girls\u2019 832 SE3. 833 SE2. 834 The OPRE programme in PT exists to promote Roma women\u2019s integration in education at graduate level (PT1). 835 European Commission, Roma Health Report \u2013 Health status of the Roma population.

The available evidence suggests that the Framework results did not address the specific needs of Roma youth to a large extent. In its 2016 assessment of the EU Framework, the European Commission called the situation of Roma youth \u2018particularly worrying\u2019 842 . Lack of Roma youth participation as well as increasing levels (56% to 63%) of young Roma aged 16 to 24 who are not in employment, education or training (NEET), with a significant gender gap (72% among young Roma women compared to 55% among young Roma men) 843 , are among the most challenging problems this subgroup faces 844 . Several measures at EU level that invest in the employability of young Roma, including the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative, fail to reach out to vulnerable groups such as Roma at the local level , despite the use of the notion \u2018hard to reach groups\u2019 845 . 839 WB11 (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). 840 WB7 (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). 841 WB3 (Regional Cooperation Council). 842 European Commission, \u2018Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Assessing the implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the Council Recommendation on Effective Roma Integration Measures\u2019, COM (2016) 424, p. 9 and 17, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/roma-report-2016_en.pdf. 843 While the NEET situation of young Roma has significantly worsened overall, FRA data uncover some differences between Member States and even an improvement in the share in some countries, including Portugal (decrease from 79% to 52%). 844 Council of the European Union, Conclusions of 8 December 2016 on Accelerating the Process of Roma Integration, 8 December 2016, 15406/16, par. 19 and 37, available at http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12225-2016-INIT/en/pdf.

Only 18% of the OPC respondents agree that the Roma youth is more empowered now than in 2011. In a Policy Paper submitted during the OPC , PEER similarly states that the European and national Roma inclusion policies insufficiently explore the potential role Roma youth could play in initiating change 846 . National level research indicates that only a small number of countries include references to the needs or special situation of young Roma in their NRIS 847 . Stakeholders from several countries explained that this does not necessarily translate into the implementation of (sufficient) special measures addressing the needs of this subgroup 848 . One factor that could explain the absence of a focus on Roma youth at the national level, is the lack of statistical data on Roma youth , which was identified in several country studies as a hindering factor to get insight in the situation of young Roma 849 , to advocate for Roma youth measures 850 , or to analyse the extent to which young Roma benefit from mainstream measures 851 .

The majority of the stakeholders consulted at the national level state that the needs of Roma youth were somewhat addressed in the Member States as well as the enlargement countries 856 , often so with a specific focus on education 857 . The results of the NGO survey seem to confirm that the key policy measures and programmes for Roma integration implemented at national level to reach the objectives of the NRIS addressed the needs of Roma youth only to a limited extent , with some differences across the different policy areas covered.

A few interesting examples in this regard were identified during the analysis. At EU level, there was the organisation of a high-level event on Roma youth empowerment in 2016 to encourage the active inclusion of young Roma in Roma inclusion policy 861 . At national level, a Slovak programme targets young Roma through activities promoting the emancipation of young people from marginalised Roma communities, strengthening their community organising capacities, and realising their involvement in public life 862 . 3.9.6 To what extent do the Framework results address the specific needs of Roma children? Roma children are among the most vulnerable subgroups and often find themselves in unfavourable conditions, including facing discrimination, trafficking in human beings, early marriage, and bullying . The 2011 EU Framework does little by way of addressing the specific needs of Roma children, except in that it increased awareness of the need. During the OPC , increased attention on the protection of Roma children following the 2013 Council Recommendation was mentioned by over 69% of the respondents as one of the main achievements of the EU Framework at EU level. In addition, one of the stakeholders interviewed at EU level credits the EU Framework for its work in having the issue of child marriage become more prominent and less taboo 863 . However, no separate or detailed child awareness section exists in the Framework. One outcome of this, according to the European Parliament , is very limited political will at national level to adopt more active approaches to Roma inclusion 864 . In 2015, the European Parliament stressed the need to prioritise Roma children in the promotion of Roma access to education, healthcare and housing when implementing the EU Framework 865 . Along these lines, the European Commission\u2019s 2016 assessment of the EU Framework calls the situation of Roma children \u2018particularly worrying\u2019 and called for a focus on this subgroup in mainstream and targeted measures promoting the participation of Roma 866 .

The European Parliament also points to a lack of indicators or targets to address the situation of Roma children 867 . Looking further at national level through the country studies , Member States differ in their level of Roma child-focus and the issues they encounter. Some Member States, including Greece, Romania and Spain, fail to specify the relevant measures they have implemented or how measures affected Roma children . It appears that national authorities sometimes report changes and measures as having been implemented within the NRIS even though they were not, in fact, part of the NRIS 868 . Such was the case in an unspecified Member State regarding child vaccinations of Hepatitis A in segregated ghettos 869 . Other Member States, such as Ireland, run into budgetary and monitoring issues that slow down progress in this area 870 . Beside health, one of the areas that seems to have done the most for Roma children is education. For example, countries such as Sweden, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria mention access to education for school children in their NRISs 871 . The comparative Figure below, taken from the OPC , shows the education measures that respondents feel have improved since the start of the Framework. Figure 15. Perception of whether Roma children needs were addressed in the area of education Source: OPC.

While many of the NRIS fail to adequately focus on Roma children, some interesting examples can be taken from various sources . For instance, in Lithuania , as part of the NRIS\u2019 action plan, people from the Vilnius Public Health Bureau went to community centres, including Roma ones, in 2014-2015, to talk with children and to educate them on healthy lifestyles 872 .

Also, the Bulgarian national budget finances additional training within the Ministry of Education\u2019s inclusive education approach which targets vulnerable children, including Roma children, in education 874 . Overall, despite the implementation of transnational and national policies and strategies on Roma inclusion in recent years, the literature suggests that Roma children\u2019s potential remains unexplored 875 . This was found to be the case in our analysis as well. For example, several of the country studies and targeted stakeholder interviews provide very limited information on specific measures of Roma children in their Member State. In addition, only one of the 65 respondents to the NGO Survey replied to the question regarding children\u2019s rights/protection. Several interviewees also stated that, despite some attention to Roma children\u2019s needs in their respective countries, anti- discrimination legislation/policy measures are either weak 876 , fail to translate into the implementation of special actions 877 , or are postponed to future dates instead of focusing on the issue now 878 . 3.9.7 Are there adequate policies in place to address social inclusion and non- discrimination of other vulnerable groups? Considering that the sources reviewed within the framework of the mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 did not include qualitative or quantitative information on the topic of the social inclusion and non- discrimination of other vulnerable groups , no analysis can be provided to formulate an answer for this question. 3.9.8 To what extent are mainstream and (non-Roma specific) targeting programmes available to Roma Good practice demonstrates that a constant, long-term approach that blends both mainstream and targeted actions is needed to promote the social inclusion and address non-discrimination experienced by the Roma. As discussed previously, in practice, most Member States have predominantly taken mainstream approaches that target vulnerable and disadvantaged populations of which Roma are a sub-group. The objectives of the EU Framework are generally reflected in these mainstream national policies, but specific references to the Roma and their needs (as well as the specific needs of other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups) are minimal . Mainly due the absence of ethnic data collection in most Member States, there appears to be an overall lack of evidence as to whether or not Roma do use such mainstream and (non-Roma specific) targeting programmes that are, in theory, available to them. Considering the overlap between this evaluation question and the Coherence-question \u2018To what extent did the EU Framework contribute to mainstreaming Roma integration into European and national policy\u2019, these questions were merged.

The principles of the EU Framework are grounded in, amongst others, the provisions in the Treaties of the European Union, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Racial Equality Directive. Conceived within a timeframe that was aligned with the Europe 2020 Strategy 882 , the 2011 Framework called upon Member States to formulate or enhance existing National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) in order to remove barriers preventing Roma from enjoying their fundamental rights, and to bridge gaps across social sectors between Roma and the general population. Enlargement countries, i.e. the Western Balkans and Turkey, have significant Roma populations and have consistently contributed to the Framework process and its proposed measures. Promoting non-discrimination and effective social integration alike, the EU Framework recommends both specifically Roma-targeted measures, and that Roma priorities should be better integrated into mainstream policies. This can be achieved by ensuring a mainstreamed approach to Roma integration and endorsing the goals in the four crucial areas of access to education, employment, healthcare and housing. The Roma integration goals in these four areas include specific targets with regard to both advancing the Roma population and to closing the gaps with the general population. It is recommended that indicators be developed at the national level. As horizontal measures, attention should be paid to strengthening non-discrimination measures and empowering the Roma both individually and collectively, in addition to protecting Roma children and women and reducing poverty through social investment. Likewise, both the 2011 Framework and 2013 Recommendation invites both Member States and the Commission to allocate funding (European Union and national), to ensure successful Roma integration, establish managing structures (notably, but not limited to, National Roma Contact Points (NRCPs)) and to appropriately monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the National Strategies. Local administration and equality bodies are to be involved in the NRIS. Since 2012, the Commission had been reporting annually on the implementation of the Framework. 883 Likewise, the issue has been subject to debate 879 EC. 2011.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 199 and a series of studies and reports in the European Parliament 884 and the Court of Auditors has published a report on the topic. 885 This report represents a mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework. Analysing the time span of 2011-16, its objective is to assess the implementation status and achievements of the EU Framework, in order to fine-tune it for the remaining implementation period 2018-20, and to provide insights for the development of possible new policy proposals for the post-2020 period. The evaluation criteria applied are relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, EU-added value, equity, sustainability and coordination. The report takes stock of Roma integration measures put in place by the EU, the Member States and the enlargement countries. Throughout the evaluation, a number of methods have been applied to gather sufficient evidence in support of the study objectives. Specifically, the team undertook a literature review; compiled eleven in-depth country case studies in a mix of countries some of which had large and others small Roma populations 886 ; conducted interviews with country experts in all other EU Member States 887 and some enlargement countries 888 ; conducted expert interviews at the European level; analysed the submissions to the Open Consultation on the EU Framework for NRIS and a survey to Roma NGOs; and assessed a wide range of European-level policy, legal, programming and financial documents (such as records on ESIF funds and the Commission\u2019s Roma Online Reporting Tool). On the 15 th of March 2018, a workshop was organised that brought together a diverse range of stakeholder participants from European civil society, Member States (including from NRCPs), enlargement countries, international organisations and Commission staff from a number of Directorate Generals; the workshop provided a space to validate initial findings, voice additional insights and receive feedback and opinions from participants. Results of the evaluation are conditioned by the limited access to rigorous data, particularly longitudinal, and sources that statistically verify a range of issues related to Roma inclusion, including programme expenditure targeting Roma and their coverage through mainstream programmes and service provision. In general, there is lack of up- to-date data on impact, or the effectiveness of existing measures. Measurement is often available at project level, but does not allow for reporting on policy indicators at the population level. Furthermore, the lack of ethnically disaggregated data at LFS or SILC level aggravate this limitation. Whilst the diversity of situations between and within countries has been taken into account, the main focus is on evaluating the EU Framework, rather than on assessing every single NRIS. 4.1 Overall Situation The EU Framework has generated an overall positive trend in terms of structures, processes and outcomes. Nevertheless, this process has not yet been translated into particularly substantive outcomes. The gap between the Roma and Non-Roma population remains very high across Member States and enlargement countries. Additionally, progress is unequal in different Member States.

Discrimination against Roma, both men and women, continues to be a critical problem. Whilst evidence is inconclusive, consultations indicate stagnation or even a rise in exposure to discrimination and anti- Gypsyism. 889 Governance mechanisms that endeavour to tackle Roma exclusion and discrimination are in place at the EU and national level, but their function is still limited and not consolidated 890 . In general, NRIS do not connect effectively to mainstream policies, as they do not involve key departments and stakeholders in a consistent, cooperative way. Economic resources have been activated and there is more investment in Roma inclusion through EU funding. 891 However, these are still scarce: particularly at the national level. Civil society participation at all stages of European multilevel governance has been fostered, however at national level social actors have limited opportunities to participate effectively in decision-making about matters that directly affect them. 892 4.2 Key findings on outcomes The Framework defined specific Roma integration goals in four areas, together with a focus on the cross-cutting issues of discrimination. The 2013 Recommendation also covered in addition to the core policy areas, horizontal issues (anti-discrimination, protection of Roma women and children, poverty reduction, empowerment) and structural measures (coordination, monitoring etc.). Together, these goals form a common vision of the necessary components for Roma integration. An overall positive trend can be detected in some areas, although this has not yet been translated into substantial improvements to the social integration of Roma. Moreover, this trend needs to be qualified according to different countries and sectors, as well as the respective socio-economic situation of different Roma groups. Furthermore, in the same area there may be progress on specific issues and stagnation or even regression in others. 893 It is however important to highlight that six years is a short period to make significantly improvements across the different areas of focus. Structural changes require time and real impact may not be seen until after a generation. A critical issue is whether previous negative trends have been reverted.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 201 establish this, the evaluation is not conclusive. However, there are some indications that a change in trend has occurred in some cases, as in education. Education is the area in which the most pronounced progress could be observed. 894 Participation of Roma in ECEC has improved since 2011 in most countries, 895 from 47% in 2011 to 53% in 2016. Attendance in compulsory education has also improved, from 86% to 90%; and early school-leaving rates have decreased from 87% to 68%. All this is resulting in reducing the gaps: progress has been made in reducing the gap in participation in ECEC. However, considerable differences remain (53% Roma compared to 90% non-Roma 896 ) between countries and by gender; while compulsory education attendance figures are now not far from the general population (90% Roma compared to 96% non-Roma). Positive results in education are related to mainstream policies in this area, completed with adequate specific support in some cases. 897 In addition, recent survey results by FRA found no significant gender gap in compulsory education attendance of Roma children. School segregation and educational attainment have been identified as critical areas: the share of Roma students attending classes where \u201call classmates are Roma\u201d has increased (from 10% to 15%) and one to two thirds of Roma children attend schools where most or all children are Roma; reportedly, this trend is less evident in EU13 898 , which is also evidenced by the infringement procedures for school segregation of Roma children started by the European Commission in Hungary, Slovakia and Czech Republic. 899 The educational attainment of Roma, evidenced in ESL rates, has improved but challenges remain. Despite the fact that the ESL rate among Roma decreased by 19% between 2011 and 2016, the gap between Roma and non-Roma remains high: as of 2016, the rate of Roma ESL was still 24 times higher than the population a whole 900 . No improvement has been observed in access to employment. The proportion of Roma who are in paid work \u2013 including self-employment and occasional work \u2013 remains similar (from 26% to 25%): moreover, there is a significant gender gap which is widening. The share of young Roma, aged 16-24, who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) has increased from 56% to 63%, again with a notable gender gap of with 72% of Roma women in a NEET situation, compared to 55% of Roma men. There is a considerable gap between the percentage of Roma and non-Roma NEETs, which has increased from 43.1 % in 2011, to 51.5% in 2016 901 . Within the context of Roma NEETs, there is a distinct gender difference observable when statistics are disaggregated by gender: 72% of Roma girls and women qualify as NEETs, while 55% of Roma boys and men do. So far improvements detected in education scarcely result in higher employment rates, and the transition from education to employment remains a 894 These statements are based on data for 9 EU MSs, for which data were collected in a comparable way for both years. These countries account for over 80% of the overall estimated Roma and Travellers population in the EU (as per Council of Europe). 895 seven out of the nine 896 These figures represent a gap between Roma and non-Roma in participation of ECEC of 37%.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 202 challenge. Several reasons have been provided for the absence of improvement in employment: among them the consequences of the economic crisis, the existing prejudices and discrimination, the absence of adapted support measures and insufficient qualification. 902 The EU-MIDIS II reports that discrimination based on ethnic or immigrant background is highest in employment. The Special Euro-Barometer 437 on discrimination in the EU in 2015 confirms these findings, particularly for the Eastern European MS. 903 Health self-perception has improved but medical health insurance coverage continues to be limited. The reported self-perceived health status of the Roma is equal to that of the general population, with notable differences across the MS, and compared to previous years, more Roma consider that their health is good or very good (from 55% to 68%), with some differences by gender. Nevertheless health care coverage has not increased (78% to 74%), with significant differences between countries. Access to health insurance and health services, including health promotion and disease prevention, poses special problems for many Roma resulting in many difficulties, namely in the area of sexual and reproductive health services, and in addition to vaccinations. 904 Very little change has been achieved in Roma housing conditions . The housing situation for many Roma families continues to be dramatic; while some countries have seen progress, in others the situation has deteriorated. In 2016, the average number of persons per room was still 0,7 (0,6 in 2011), 30% of households did not have tap water inside the dwelling (29% in 2011) and the share of people living in households having neither toilet, shower, nor bathroom inside the dwelling was reportedly 38% (36% in 2011). Most of the households reportedly have an electricity supply (92% to 96%). Available data does not indicate a decrease in discrimination issues in the field of access to housing, but on the contrary in some countries a notable increase can be observed. In the years under scrutiny, very little was done to improve Roma housing: housing segregation continues to be a problem in some countries, both in urban and rural areas; and Roma demographic concentration and physical segregation in areas with lack of services and unsafe environments perpetuate stigmatisation. Many housing conditions are largely substandard and the gap in access to public utilities remains. Forced housing evictions of Roma, sometimes related to institutional violence, continue to be reported across a wide range of Member States and EU candidate and potential candidate countries. 905 Manifestations of anti-Gypsyism \u2013 namely discrimination, hate-crime, hate- speech and hate-motivated harassment of Roma \u2013 continue to be a matter of 902 Gatti, Roberta et al. 2016.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 203 high concern in European societies, despite evidence of improvement in several areas. Regarding the experience of direct discrimination, according to surveys, the overall share of Roma who felt discriminated against when in contact with schools (as a parent or student) has not decreased significantly (17% to 14%); there has been a significant decrease when accessing health services (20% to 9% in the case of men and 19% to 7% in the case of women). 906 In the past five years, the share of Roma who felt they were discriminated against when looking for housing has dropped slightly (45% to 41%); the rates of Roma who felt they faced discrimination \u201cwhen looking for a job\u201d and \u201cat work\u201d still remain high (40% and 17%, respectively), despite a considerable drop by 10% in the first category. Hate-motivated harassment over the past 12 months due to Roma background is reported to have increased in all countries, reaching up to 29% of Roma in some country. 907 Physical violence, motivated by anti-Gypsyism, has reportedly increased in many countries, and physical violence toward the families is reportedly frequent (13%). According to the consultations, Anti-Gypsyism has increased, fuelled by racist political parties and the intolerant positions in some mainstream political parties. 908 All this was seen by the stakeholders consulted to have influenced negative attitudes and prejudices towards Roma that need to be tackled. Individual and structural discrimination remains a reality for many Roma in their daily lives, notably in employment and when accessing public services. 4.3 Key Findings on structures and processes At the policy level, the EU framework has helped to signal the importance of the Roma issue in the European agenda and has generated initial awareness for more decisive action. The most notable achievement of the Framework is that the Roma issue is more present in the political and institutional agendas at the EU and national level - including in the enlargement countries. 909 This is reinforced by the annual reporting of the Commission, as well as by a number of reports and resolutions adopted by the European Parliament. Institutional processes have been stabilised since 2011. This translated into calling on all Member States and enlargement countries to establish an NRIS or integrated set of policy measures, 910 as well as an NRCP. Coordination between Member States and the European Commission has established clear lines of communication that are often crosscutting to Ministries and DGs. A system of reporting between NRCPs and the Commission has been established and successively improved. This has led to better knowledge on the respective measures and projects in process, despite the operational challenge to clearly determine the amount of funds channelled 906 Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS II). 907 Facts of harassment relate to: offensive or threatening comments in person; threats of violence in person; offensive gestures or inappropriate staring, offensive or threatening e-mails or text messages and offensive comments made about them online. 908 Anti-Gypsyism as underlying cause for discrimination has been consistently mentioned in the consultation for this evaluation, such as in the 15 March workshop. It has been highlighted by submissions to the open consultation as well as in specific contributions, see: Carrera, Sergio, Iulius Rostas, and Lina Vosyli\u016bt\u0117. 2017.

Stakeholder cooperation has improved and a communities of practice and policy have emerged, such as those facilitated by the Roma Platform or the EU Roma Network. 911 Opportunities for funding through the ESIF funds have been opened, specifically since 2014, whilst national allocations of funds has been slower. Participation of civil society representatives in the overall process has been strengthened, in addition to the structured engagement of Roma organisations. At national level, more policy units and services departments are aware of Roma needs and have a better understanding of Roma inclusion issues, due to the NRIS process. However, the implementation of the EU Framework demonstrates some weakness. To date, only limited achievements have been identified with regard to the living conditions of Roma, tackling discrimination and removing barriers to exercising their fundamental rights. At the national level, many NRIS are unfocussed in their objectives and their mechanisms of planning, implementation and evaluation are weak. NRCPs have limited institutional weight and lack capacity to develop their mission. Implementation of the EU Framework remains fragmented, due to lack of consistency between objectives in NRIS, few large-scale programmes, limited national resources and underdeveloped implementation mechanisms. Most of the NRIS lack specific targets and effective implementation and monitoring mechanisms. Most Member States have reported that they currently invest more economic resources in Roma inclusion, that Roma integration is to some extent on their agenda and that they consult Roma organisations more often. Nevertheless, in many cases the efforts have translated only into small, short-term projects and activities rather than in consistent policies and programmes inserted into mainstream public policy. There are still only a few cases where a NRIS has resulted in inclusive mainstream policies and explicit but not exclusive programmes . As principles, both \u201cexplicit but not exclusive\u201d and \u201cinclusive mainstream policies\u201d, have to coexist and give coherence to the NRIS. 912 Harmonisation and synergy rarely happens. Most countries rather embark on policy oscillation between the two of them. Furthermore, an integrated approach combining sector policies is still missing in most cases. Likewise, reporting systems frequently have only weak mechanisms in place to generate valid data on impact at programme level, and there are no routine data collection systems on the Roma at population level. 913 Antidiscrimination has not been taken up sufficiently as a crosscutting element, either in the strategy and less so in practice, according to a number of civil society organisations. 914 The participation of 911 The European Network on Roma Inclusion under ESI Funds (EURoma Network) brings together public authorities responsible for Roma policies and those responsible for ESI Funds from fifteen EU Member States, as well as the European Commission, with the aim of improving the use of ESI Funds for the promotion of the social inclusion, equal opportunities and fight against discrimination of the Roma community. www.euromanet.eu 912 EC 2012: What works for Roma inclusion in the EU - Policies and model approaches, Brussels https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/864560d3-3572-4e3f-a017- 9304a8c1550d/language-en 913 Ethnically disaggregated data collection is a contentious issue, which in some countries is inhibited by constitutional provisions.

The connection between legal, policy and financial instruments together with the institutional coordination mechanisms form the working basis of the EU framework.

Other Member States are under examination regarding education as well as housing. In 2008, a new instrument has been added with the Council Framework Decision on combatting Racism and Xenophobia. While anti- Gypsyism has been recognised as a specific form of racism by the CoE - but not consistently by Member States - mechanisms available should be used to combat Roma discrimination, hate speech and harassment. Commission initiatives such as the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, the work of the EU High Level Group on combating racisms and other forms of intolerance and EU funding supporting projects on preventing and combating hates speech and hate crime play will remain important in the fight against anti-Gypsyism. (2) Policy : The Commission's Roma Team has played a substantial role in engaging key departments of the European Commission in the implementation of the Strategies. 917 This process of internal coordination, through the Task Force and other instruments, has improved over time and has demonstrated results. Country-specific recommendations have been addressed to five Member States in the European Semester as well as references in Country Reports on education, employment, social inclusion in others. The challenge has been to include the Roma issue in EC flagship initiatives and key social reforms, such as the Social Investment Package, the Skills Agenda, the Youth Guarantee or European Pillar for Social Rights. (3) Financial : The 2014-2020 Structural Funds regulations have opened up new opportunities for investing in Roma by allocating EUR 1.5 billion under investment priority in the ESF (IP9ii), and the possibility to develop integrated housing operations under the ERDF amongst others. In particular, the thematic ex-ante conditionality contributed to ensuring that Member States put in place effective NRIS. 918 Most Member States have made use of these possibilities and more ESI funds have been allocated to Roma through other investment priorities, notwithstanding the difficulties in determining the precise amount of funding allocated and the limited absorption of these funds at this stage. 919 915 European Roma Grassroots Organizations Network ERGO 2016, Countering the Shrinking Space for Roma Civil society, Brussels; European Roma Rights Centre 2013: National Roma Integration Strategies: What next?, Roma Rights \u2013 Journal of the European Roma Rights Centre; 916 This comes strongly out in the case studies.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 206 In terms of Governance the regular meetings with the NRCPs, the annual communications and the annual system of reporting are in place and many Member States have reported positive opinions to this process. The role of the FRA in gathering data and evidence for the evaluation, providing tools for the improvement of data collection systems and fundamental rights monitoring, in addition to giving guidance to Member States has supported this process. The EU framework has established a permanent system of cooperation with key actors: cooperation with the Council of Europe includes several joint programmes. Likewise, civil society organisations and Roma civil society, international organisations, such as UN Agencies and OSCE, and academia have been engaged in the process. 920 Thanks to the Framework, many disperse initiatives are now better known and aligned. Today, more actors are engaged in Roma inclusion and exchange and coordination is improving. This has resulted in gathering knowledge, concentrating economic resources and strengthening forces for Roma inclusion. Several elements, which had either been initially conceived in the EU Framework or emerged afterwards as needs, are not sufficiently addressed in the approach as it is currently applied by Member States. Roma empowerment (both individually and collectively) has been a horizontal issue, but is not often translated operationally, or equipped with sufficient funds. 921 Furthermore, the Roma situations and social inclusion trends in different countries are different and in continuously changing. In this sense, the EU framework has not been sensitive to particular sub-groups, and has not paid special attention to the need of specific groups: namely children, EU-mobile Roma and Roma migrants, amongst others. Likewise, a gender-sensitive approach to addressing both Roma women and men has not fully evolved. Another issue is the focus on the four priority sectors: whilst it has helped to clearly orient priorities, other sectors have possible been underexposed. Many Member States formulated additional priorities, including issues of rule of law, crime, media, political participation, or Roma culture. Poverty reduction as an objective has lost weight against the other sectors, as expressed in the limited attention towards social investment policies. 4.4 Relevance In respect to the question of whether, and to what extent the original objectives have proven to be appropriate in view of Roma needs, the original objectives set in 2011 were confirmed to be appropriate overall to the Roma inclusion needs at the time: both in the Member States, and in the enlargement countries. Overall, the four priority areas have been confirmed as key to Roma inclusion, although some of the goals lacked ambition and some specific objectives where defined narrowly. The objectives similarly continue to be relevant today in both Member States and enlargement countries: all of them are far from being reached, except in the case of the target of universal primary education enrolment. The evaluation has also identified possible additional specific objectives which would be relevant according to current needs (see Recommendations). While the objectives remain valid for all countries (including enlargement countries), they insufficiently take on board the different country contexts and diversity of Roma situations, which require a higher degree of adaptation and differentiation of the 920 European Commission n.d. \u201cEU Platform for Roma inclusion: Frequently asked questions\u201d [website]; Open Society European Policy Institute 2017: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, Budapest/Brussels. 921 Much of the critique by ethnically Roma organizations is geared towards the little investment that is dedicated towards strengthening self-organization and the capacities for policy analysis and advocacy.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 207 respective dimensions of the objectives, so that they can be prioritised according to distinct national and Roma circumstances . Most Member States, have Roma mobility within and between Member States, in particular following the lifting of restrictions to the freedom of movement of citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, are not adequately considered, particularly by NRIS. 922 Generally, the specific disadvantages or women and specific responses to Roma youth have not been sufficiently been taken into account. 923 In addition, more attention is needed to interconnectedness and complementarity across the four policy areas, and with regard to the integrated approach towards programming. Evidence has confirmed the importance of combining the social inclusion and anti- discrimination objectives of the EU Framework; however, these have not been sufficiently balanced in practice, which, in part, appears to be due to limited awareness among implementers of the distinction between the two objectives. The high levels of discrimination, anti-Gypsyism are critical issues that find limited reflection in the NRIS. 924 Efforts have not focused as much on institutional forms of discrimination. 925 4.5 Coherence In respect to the question of whether, and to what extent the EU Framework contributed to mainstreaming Roma integration into European and national policies, initial progress is recorded at the EU level, and to a more varied extent (mostly a lesser degree), at country level, both in Member States and enlargement countries. At the EU level, progress has been made in linking the EU framework with legal, policy and financial instruments and this trend is ongoing. The Racial Equality Directive, together with the Council\u2019s Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia of 2008 and other instruments have provided a normative ground for the monitoring of the fundamental rights situation of Roma. 926 The Commission has followed up on the implementation of the Racial Equality Directive. 927 Three Member States have been submitted to infringement procedures for school segregation of Roma children 928 .

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 208 related issues have been included in the Semester Processes. 929 However, the lack of specific measurable targets for the area of anti-discrimination in the EU Framework constitutes the basis for a missed opportunity to reinforce policy measures to fight discrimination against Roma. 930 The Roma integration needs have been reflected in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the European Semester Process including through Country Specific Recommendations in some Member States 931 . The EU framework is not fully taken-up in key EU social policies. In key initiatives - such as Youth Guarantee, Skills Agenda, VET and the Alliance for Apprenticeships, the Pillar of Social Rights, Investing in Children - Roma integration is mentioned, though most frequently in a cursory manner. However, linking the agendas with Roma inclusion both at DG level and on the ground seems challenging. 932 Substantial progress has been made in linking Roma integration priorities with EU financial instruments. More Structural and Investments Funds in the new 2014-2020 programming period have been allocated to Roma. Allocations under Roma targeted IP 9ii is available for 12 Member States that selected this IP; detailed quantitative information on the exact level of financial allocations specifically targeting Roma under other ESF IPs is however not available. Having an NRIS has been set as an ex-ante conditionality for accessing ESIF. Investment Priority 9ii and the eligibility of housing actions in ERDF provide for specific funding windows oriented towards Roma integration. 933 All this has provided additional opportunities to align Roma needs with mainstream policies. 934 At national level, in the four policy, evidence suggests that the EU Framework has contributed to mainstreaming Roma integration into policies to a limited extent across the Member States and the enlargement countries.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 209 to which this can be attributed to the EU Framework could not be measured. Evidence in this context is particularly limited in the health sector, where the lack of targeted policies and data, have been emphasised as factors impeding such mainstreaming. The EU Framework more clearly contributed to the area of education in terms of drop-outs and furthering primary school participation of Roma children. In terms of employment, objectives are generally part of mainstream policies and often lack specific targeted measures or reference to Roma integration. In terms of housing, equally, there is no evidence of housing segregation and forced evictions remain problematic. With respect to trafficking in human beings , only two NRIS (from the eleven where country studies were carried out) included targets or measures to combat trafficking. The contribution of the NRIS to the fight against trafficking appears thus marginal in most countries, even though such countries have active policies and measures focusing on trafficking in human beings. The NRIS have contributed to the fight against discrimination, racism and hate speech in a number of countries by including an anti-discrimination objective 935 or indirectly via the Racial Equality Directive 936 . Nonetheless, in some countries it was not possible to identify a clear contribution, either due to the absence of policy objectives 937 and measures, or the contribution was limited due to limited scope of policy measures 938 and budget of anti-discrimination institutions 939 . 4.6 Effectiveness The achievement of the objectives of the 2011 Framework has shown measured progress in some areas (education, health) and insufficient progress in relation to the objectives of employment and housing. Results are limited and are unequal across sectors. Many Roma have experienced improvements in access to services, most notably in education. Some improvements have been achieved in health, while in employment and housing the situation remains critical. 940 Anti-discrimination has not been established as a cross-cutting principle to guide policies. 941 Therefore, key mainstream policies in the areas of education, employment, health and housing affecting Roma are not oriented by an equal opportunities approach. Also, anti-Gypsyism and discrimination continue to hamper Roma inclusion. There are substantial differences between countries. The progress remains unequal across Member States. In respect to Roma-non-Roma gap in compulsory education enrolment rates, for instance, in Romania the gap has widened, while in Greece, it is still around 40%. On the issue of rates of Roma medical coverage, while most countries have made little progress, Czech Republic and Hungary register a fall in the rates of medical coverage of Roma by more than 10 percentage points. The reasons for achieving only limited results are the need for more time, a lack of political will, 935 CS-AT, CS-BG-, CS-RO, CS-SK, CS-IT, CS-HU, CS-CZ, CS-ES 936 CS-SK; CS-ES 937 CS-FR, CS-EL 938 CS-AT, CS-BG, CS-EL, CS-CZ, CS-SK 939 CS-RO, CS-BG 940 Evidence derived from EU MIDIS II survey, cited above. 941 European Roma Information Office 2017: ERIO Position Paper on the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and a post-2020 strategy as a contribution to the Mid-term review of the European Commission, Brussels http://cloud2.snappages.com/ecc3fa83da15cf423fe3aaa342f545fa355b24f3/ERIO%20position%20paper_Mi dterm%20assessment%20EU%20Framework_FINAL.pdf ; Chopin, Isabelle, Catharina Germaine, and Judit Tanczos 2017: Roma and the Enforcement of Anti-Discrimination Law, Brussels. http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=47560 ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 210 insufficient funding, deficient coordination between the national and local level, and lack of integrated and long-term projects of critical size. At EU level, the EU framework has been effective in creating a process of positive trends by involving structures, engaging actors, creating working mechanisms, establishing synergies with other policies and to a limited extent attracting EU funds. The issue of Roma inclusion is on the political agenda, there is engagement of the European institutions, with the establishment of a clear mandate, targets and processes. Annual reporting is in place, though, generates limited evidence of progress towards achieving the objectives of the EU Framework. Opportunities for EU funding have been opened, and different stakeholders are working together with greater participation of civil society representatives and Roma organisations. At the national level, change is also tangible, but to a lesser extent and depending on countries. Today, in some countries, there is better understanding of the Roma issue and there are strategic policy documents in place. In their implementation most NRIS lack an integrated approach and the anti-discrimination perspective is absent 942 . NRCPs have limited weight to influence Ministries in order to mainstream Roma issues and influence key sector policies to be receptive for the inclusion of the Roma. 943 There is a disconnect and inconsistency between the national and local/regional levels. Often measures are fragmented and project-focused, which leads to discontinued provision of services, thereby restricting the establishment of a rights-based approach. Country reports display frequent inconsistencies between objectives, programmes, resources and mechanisms of implementation. Furthermore, in some countries, there are some negative external factors that have influenced inclusion and coordination efforts, such as the economic crisis and the growing popularity of political actors and movements with anti-integration agenda. Stakeholder cooperation of public authorities and civil society has increased . At national level, the NRIS have brought together a range of different stakeholders, including civil society representatives. Roma involvement has been formalised, but often remains superficial. Roma participation has increased at the national level and most NRIS have systems of consultation in place with Roma civil society. However, the need remains for more effective Roma engagement at all levels, including in terms of ensuring a gender perspective. 944 The role of civil society participation is still limited in terms of stakeholder involvement in monitoring progress. Furthermore, an articulation of participation between Roma NGOs and mainstream social NGOs rarely occurs in practice, and Roma issues are barely present in the mainstream social inclusion agenda. 945 Local level capacity to implement NRIS remains limited and it is highly dependent on EU funded projects. 942 These claims had been widely voiced during the deliberations in the 15 March workshop, see as well ERIO 2018 and UN-OHCHR 2018. 943 Open Society European Policy Institute 2017: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, Budapest 2017; Roma Civil Monitor pilot project 2018: A Synthesis Report on Implementation of National Roma Integration Strategies in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, Budapest; 944 Roma Civil Monitor 2018: Synthesis Report on the Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 211 At the EU level, there has been significant investment in consultation processes, such as the Roma Platform. 946 The Commission has successfully facilitated cooperation between stakeholders at various levels and across countries. While further progress can still be made in the remaining period, substantial changes are unlikely to take place. Changes in discriminatory attitudes or changes in health and education parameters take many years, or in the case of housing, also substantial investments (which have not been planned). The rapidly falling unemployment rates and labour shortages in the EU provide some conditions for improvement of the employment situation of Roma and may contribute to achieving some progress in that respect. 4.7 Efficiency With respect to the question on what factors influenced efficiency of EU and national interventions, the coordination instruments in place at the EU and national level have in many cases improved due to the EU Framework. Efficiency has increased as funds were spent in a more coordinated and targeted manner. Coordination, exchange of information, planning and reporting have been identified as critical areas for improving efficiency. Amongst the critical areas of progress are a better integration of NRCPs into wider government policy making process , which signifies a move from the NRCP representing a symbolic unit, to becoming efficient advocates for mainstreaming within sector ministries. Existing monitoring and reporting systems are weak at the national level and feed into a fragmented monitoring system at European level. The reporting system at the EU level has successively improved over time. It is considered to be helpful for most Member States as it provides better information and facilitates easier comparisons between countries. Nevertheless, many countries consider that the information requested is difficult to process, particularly when it involves data compilation by other departments, namely from the regional or local level. Also, some redundancies with EU Semester Process and EU funding reporting have been identified by some Member States as being burdensome. There is strong qualitative evidence that the introduction of the Framework has increased the funding on interventions targeting Roma and, of equal importance, that the EU funds was spent in a more coordinated manner. Evidence has emerged on the return on investments in the social inclusion of Roma in the areas of education, showing significant long-term economic benefits. The effect of attending pre-primary education was estimated to be the equivalent of more than a year of formal schooling (PISA 2013), as individuals who attend ECEC perform better at school and are more likely to remain in education for longer 947 . An additional year of formal schooling was estimated to lead to an increase in earnings of 10%. 948 In general, only scarce robust evidence could be obtained on the efficiency of the strategies as a whole. Only partial data from some Member States on national and EU funding for some 2015 and 2016 was available, and even this data needed be subject to sensitivity analysis to gain a more objective understanding of the actual levels of spending. 946 See the latest meeting of the European Platform for Roma Inclusion in November 2017 on \"Transition from education to employment\" http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?item_id=607095 947 Janna van Belle (2011) ECEC and Care (ECEC) and its long-term effects on educational and labour market outcomes Janna van Belle.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 212 There are significant potential monetary benefits from closing the gaps in employment, earnings and education. These changes may lead to a positive long-term economic impact of around EUR 333 million per year. 4.8 EU Added Value EU action has provided added value to national Roma policies and their implementation through political, governance and financial dimensions. Roma integration would not have advanced as it did without the EU Framework. At the political level, the EU has stimulated political action and fostered political will to act on Roma inclusion issues. At the governance level, it has provided policy guidance, a monitoring and reporting framework, supported greater accountability and transparency, and opportunities for mutual exchange and coordination. One of the key advantages of EU action is to foster policy learning both within public administration and a wider community, by supporting initiatives such as the NRCP network, the EU Roma Network and the Roma Platform. 949 The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has been fully aligned to the Framework objectives by generating evidence on living conditions and discrimination patterns, monitoring rights violations, sensitising the general public on issues of fundamental rights and discrimination and training and guiding public authorities and social actors in better implementing policies geared towards Roma integration. 950 At the financial level, EU funds have supported the implementation of the NRIS. In some countries, Roma inclusion has found its place in the national political agenda due to the orientation from the EU political agenda. Whereas in other countries, notably those with higher Roma populations or previous engagement in the Roma Decade 951 , the EU Framework has strengthened existing structures. In all the countries, albeit to a differing degree, the EU Framework has contributed to a stronger sense of ownership of Roma issues. In that sense, as the Framework raised the attention on Roma issues in countries with a smaller Roma population, mainly in Northern and Western European Countries, an incipient European agenda had been constructed. 952 EU action is necessary as many national Roma policies have been put in place due to the EU Framework. Member States alone would do less towards Roma inclusion and experts all agree that without EU guidance, Member States would have devised their policies and implementation mechanisms in a different, most likely less effective manner. In other cases, where specific Roma policies existed prior to the EU framework, the EU framework guided and focused the national policies by identifying priorities, improving the planning and monitoring and strengthening their previous processes. In many countries, much of the funding for Roma inclusion has been triggered by EU funding, while there seems to be more reticence to invest domestic money into Roma integration. In some cases this has led to an over-reliance on EU funding. Often, ESIF funded interventions do not fully integrated into national public policies and budgets. However, EU funds have contributed, in many cases, towards the scaling up of existing projects, intensifying actions and improving the quality of interventions. Should the EU Framework discontinue, it is likely that the political will and commitment to Roma inclusion will be reduced, especially at the regional and local level. This would translate into stopping the NRIS implementation and negatively affect the living and working conditions of Roma, not only stopping but also potentially reversing the current trend towards an improvement of Roma situation. 949 See the work of DG Justice on non-discrimination of Roma here https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice- and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/roma-and-eu_en 950 See the web site of the Fundamental Rights Agency dedicated to Roma issues here fra.europa.eu/en/theme/roma/ 951 AL, BiH, BG, CZ, ES, HU, HR, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, ME, RO, RS, SK. 952 In the workshop discussion, an inquiry amongst all participants led to 97% percent agreeing that there is EU Added Value with regard to Roma inclusion in the Member States.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 213 4.9 Sustainability At present, the effects of the EU Framework are little likely to last after 2020. Insufficient measures have been taken to ensure that Roma integration is inscribed in mainstream measures in the four key areas. Furthermore, both sustainable funding and solid community engagement procedures have not been consolidated. Projects with a mainstream approach are more likely to be sustainable than targeted ones. Positive trends in results may endure in some areas as in education, where inclusive reform of mainstream policies have been more effective. Nevertheless, substantial and continued political commitment, public action and funding of NRIS is still needed to secure the blossoming positive change in the trend towards better integration and revert the risk that some programmes would disappear. 953 Mechanisms in place are still in the process of consolidation. Most of the current national policies and structures created around the NRIS (NRCP, systems of coordination, monitoring and reporting, events, systems of consultation to the civil society and Roma organisations) would stop or would be less operational and more symbolic if the EU Framework does not continue after 2020. 954 There is a need for more time to ensure greater sustainability and long-term impact of policies, and for the consolidation of working structures at both the EU and national level. Phasing out Roma integration from ESIF would result in the discontinuation of many programmes as a significant number of the new initiatives addressing Roma inclusion have been developed due to the EU Framework and its support by ESIF, especially ESF. These funds are inadequately consolidated in the institutional budget. Consequently, much of the action is developed as transitory, one-off projects rather than long-term and sustainable programmes. Changes in political leadership, new priorities or budget constraints could put the sustainability of such projects at risk, if it is not supported by a European Framework. Substantial measures need to be adopted in order to guarantee sustainability . There is a need for a more rights-based approach as a foundation of institutional awareness and consistent structures that are inclusive and responsive to diversity. Not all Member States have yet conceived of Roma integration as a long-term commitment that requires permanent structures and budgets. Working structures, programmes and budgets need to be integrated into mainstream policies and not just considered as short- term complementary actions. Guaranteeing the continuation of programmes and projects requires a longer timeframe and many programmes and projects initiated prior to the EU framework were only short-term and relied on annual extensions, with interruptions in some cases. 955 4.10 Coordination At EU level, coordination mechanisms are considered effective in supporting the dialogue among different DGs, among NRCPs and between NRCPs and the European Commission, and between the European Commission, civil society and other stakeholders. Coordination structures and layered systems of EU monitoring and knowledge sharing \u2013 such as the Roma Team, the Task force and its linkages into different DGs 956 , Network of NRCPs, the EU Roma Network, European Platform for Roma Inclusion \u2013 have resulted in a better definition of the policy agenda. 953 Open Society European Policy Institute 2017: Revisiting the EU Roma Framework: Assessing the European Dimension for the Post-2020 Future, Budapest/Brussels 954 As documented in country case studies and interviews. 955 See the successful programming principles outlined in EC 2012: What works for Roma inclusion in the EU - Policies and model approaches, Brussels 956 JUST, EMPL, EAC, SANT\u00c9, NEAR, HOME, REGIO, AGRI ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 214 This has led to more precise engagement of the different departments dedicated to Roma issues within their institutional environment, namely line Ministries at Member State level and DGs at EU level, respectively. However, within the Commission, limited visibility of the task force may have decreased its efficiency. Coordination with EU Funds has been strengthened at EU level . ESIF regulations 2014-2020 have been sensitive to Roma needs. This has resulted in opening more opportunities for funding programmes targeting Roma, as well as other vulnerable groups, at the national and local level. The EU Roma Network, which brings together NRCP and ESIF managing authorities, has been a prime space for knowledge exchange and a definition of good practice. At national level, the establishment of NRCPs has represented a positive step and has led to improvements in the cooperation among institutions and stakeholders. However, given their mandate and powers, the NRCPs only have limited influence on the design and implementation of mainstream policies and, more generally, on policies implemented by other institutions at the national and local level. Coordination is not yet well integrated into the policy cycle of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. NRIS are little known, even in some cases by key administrative departments in the Government. There is need for strengthening the capacity of NRCPs for improving coordination. Relevant stakeholders have been engaged around the EU Framework. Stakeholder cooperation and dialogue has been developed, amongst others, by regular means such as the European Roma Platform at EU level, National Roma Platforms at Member State level, and consultation meetings with civil society organisations (CSOs). In this way, Roma issues have been mainstreamed in civil society dialogue, generating better consensus and aligning forces. 957 The EU framework has been sensitive to the consultation of Roma organisations and Roma leaders, but meaningful participation does not yet comprise the ability to influence decision-making. The presence of Roma has been prominent in many events and the Commission has supported different initiatives aimed at encouraging greater participation. At the national level, the EU Framework contributed to boosting stakeholder participation, including Roma representatives and CSOs, via the National Roma Platforms, whose capacity building was supported by the Commission. At the national level, the involvement of civil society organisations in the monitoring and evaluation processes remained limited, while the EU-supported the Roma Civil Monitor project involved over 90 NGOs in 27 Member States in monitoring NRIS implementation. 4.11 Equity Roma policy has been subject to the wider mechanisms for monitoring of discrimination and human rights. The EU Framework has made permanent reference to the EU legal instruments protecting human rights and equal opportunities. The FRA has played an important role in collecting and analysing data to establish a measurement of compliance and achievement. Anti-Gypsyism as special form of racism has been included in official documents of both the European Commission and Parliament, but had only limited influence at national level. 958 National Equality 957 To the Platform meetings, the Roma summits can be added.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 215 Bodies as well as judicial systems within Member States have not been sufficiently engaged in balancing the wider anti-discrimination objectives with Roma needs. 959 The analysis suggests that the EU Framework generally fails to address the different needs of vulnerable subgroups and would benefit from a much stronger focus on multiple and intersectional discrimination. The analysis suggests that the implementation of the EU Framework generally lacks a gender perspective. Partially, this had been amended by the new orientation of the 2013 Council recommendation. The marginalisation of Roma women and girls in all sectors, including political participation, has not found adequate policy responses. In particular, Member States have not given sufficient support to tackling child and early marriage, and strengthen outreach by and access to mainstream services for victims of domestic violence. EU-mobile citizens and third country nationals, particularly those migrating to the EU15, are barely considered in the NRIS of reception countries. The need to guarantee their protection is not fully considered in the NRIS or their implementation. In some cases, national practices of forcefully returning Roma migrants have disregarded the overall objective of the EU framework. The absence of an explicit gender focus in the EU Framework has translated into the NRIS lacking indicators and targets to tackle Roma women\u2019s specific situation as well as is a lack of (political) commitment at the national level to take a more proactive approach to addressing gender needs 960 . Many NRIS either take a gender- neutral approach 961 or they lack explicit gender measures in nearly all areas except for health 962 . 5 Recommendations Roma exclusion and discrimination have existed in Europe\u2019s societies for centuries. Overcoming this situation requires long-term commitments. The EU Framework is the beginning of a process that, despite the many limitations and considering the massive task ahead, has demonstrated positive results and an initial change of trends. Member States alone would not have achieved the same results. The EU Framework has played a substantive role in the achievements by combining legal, policy and financial instruments. EU funds have contributed to mobilising public action for Roma inclusion. It is essential that NRIS, guided by a common framework, are continued and improved. Whilst the initial phase has achieved some tangible, albeit limited results, the overall process must now be strengthened and better focussed, with emphasis on enhanced political commitment, the introduction of measurable targets and rigorous monitoring, more effective implementation supported by adequate funding, and participatory governance systems. 959 EC 2014: Joint Report on the Application of Racial Equality Directive and of the Employment Equality Directive - Com(2014)2., Brussels https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52014DC0002&from=EN 960 European Roma and Travellers Forum, Report: National Roma Integration Strategies.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 216 Based on the findings of the evaluation, this section identifies the key challenges for the future and proposes recommendations, both general and specific. While some of them are valid for all actors, other are specific to specific stakeholders. Where possible they refer to the remaining period of the EU Framework 2011-2020 or to the post 2020. 5.1 Key recommendations Timeframe 2018-2020 Roma needs should be better integrated in mainstream policies and social protection systems: Effective inclusion of Roma happens when mainstream policies in the key areas of education, employment, health and housing are sensitive and responsive to their specific needs. To this end, policies need to compensate for the specific disadvantages and become more accessible to Roma, including targeted measures where necessary. Most of the current policies aiming at Roma inclusion are still peripheral, ad hoc (i.e. mostly based on projects) and lacking a systemic perspective. 963 Steps should be taken to improve the sustainability of NRIS: The present evaluation shows that the sustainability of the results of the EU Framework could be secured only if the following steps are undertaken by the Commission and Member States: (i) allocation of EU and national funding is consistent; (ii) inclusive public policies that recognise the needs of the most vulnerable, both Roma and non-Roma are developed; and (iii) Roma are involved through consultation in the decision making process. Timeframe 2020 onwards The EU Framework and the NRISs should continue after 2020: There is a strong consensus on the negative consequences on Roma integration if the Framework were to be discontinued. It is crucial that the process continues in the long-term in order to achieve meaningful structural changes. EU institutions, Member States and enlargement and neighbourhood countries share the duty of guaranteeing human rights, promoting equality and combatting discrimination. Without the EU Framework, Roma issues are likely to receive much less attention in the EU policy agenda. In some countries, the NRIS would cease to exist; in many others it would be substantially weakened, therefore further reducing political commitment to Roma inclusion. The profile of the future EU framework and the NRIS should be raised: An upgraded EU Framework should help second-generation NRIS to be more effective: (I) Legal: While the 2013 Council Recommendation has been an important step, there would be scope for a follow-up Recommendation or similar instrument which, building on achievements to date, sets out the main challenges and priorities. (II) Political: High level commitment needs to be secured and the tendencies, in some countries, of declining political priority at national and local level have to be reversed. (III) Funding: EU, MS and enlargement and neighbourhood countries have to commit to effective financial support, recognising that closing the gap will require substantive and sustained funding. Guidelines on the use of ESI Funds should clearly orient interventions towards non-segregation and effective inclusion, and determine eligibility. (IV) Empowerment: Effective Roma participation and engagement is one of the main elements for impact. Enlargement and neighbourhood countries should be included in a future EU Framework: The Western Balkan countries and Turkey already participate in the structured dialogue with Member States on Roma generated by the Framework. An enhanced engagement with the enlargement countries provides an unprecedented opportunity to support reforms improving the status of Roma. These countries could 963 A number of successful programming principles have been identified. These are summarized in the Common Basic Principles (annexed in the Court of Auditors\u2019 2016 report op cit), see as well EC 2012: What works for Roma inclusion in the EU - Policies and model approaches, Brussels ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 217 fully benefit from the EU Framework after 2020. Their inclusion in the Framework will allow for the use of further guidance and conditionalities during the accession process. Benchmarking Roma situation, both in terms of equality and inclusion, will make Enlargement countries\u2019 governments to commit to sustained inclusion and anti- discrimination efforts. 5.2 Sector Priorities The Framework has defined the 2011 Roma Integration Goals. These have been taken up in the NRIS to varying degrees and according to the national contexts. While the conclusions identified the goals as generally relevant, they point to adjustments in specific targets, such as, for example, extending towards secondary education. However, for the remaining implementation period 2018-20 an adjustment of the objectives and targets does not seem reasonable in order to maintain the consistency of national planning and target setting. Therefore, the readjustment of sector priorities refers to the post-2020 period. After 2020, if the EU Framework is continued, such potential policy initiative on Roma inclusion, should include anti-discrimination as one of the priority areas, as well as a crosscutting priority. The human rights approach to Roma integration is necessary and has to be strengthened. The integration of Roma forms part of a wider agenda of equality and fundamental rights. The European Union and its Member States have to comply with a series of obligations both in terms of social rights and equal treatment of minorities, provided in the EU Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Racial Equality Directive of 2000, the Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia of 2008 and the Council Recommendation on Roma in 2013. These obligations have lately been reiterated in different policy commitments, such as in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 964 Anti-Gypsyism has not been sufficiently tackled as a specific form of racism. The concept of anti-Gypsyism has various manifestations, such as discrimination, harassment or hate crime against Roma. It includes both acts by majority populations as well as institutional forms of discrimination. 965 Tackling Anti-Gypsyism should be operationalised by detecting instances where State institutions fail to respect Roma rights when co-producing or reproducing prejudice and stereotyping, as well as when failing to protect Roma from rights violations by third parties. 966 The value of the anti- Gypsyism concept lies in shifting the obligation towards public institutions to deliver on 964 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is supported by a solid framework of goals, targets, indicators and statistical data to monitor progress. Of these, the following are of particular relevance to the Roma inclusion in Europe: 1.3 social protection floors, 2.1 hunger and food security, 3.8 universal health coverage, 4.1-6 access to quality education, 6.1 access to safe drinking water, 11.1 affordable housing. Gender equality is transversal to all goals (and indicators) and specifically mentioned in goal 5. Equal treatment is covered in a crosscutting manner and specifically in target 10.3. Relevant are protection from violence 16.1 and political participation 16.7. Target 17.18 calls for ethnically disaggregated data collection. 965 ECRI defines Anti-Gypsyism as a \u201cspecific form of racism, an ideology founded on racial superiority, a form of dehumanisation and institutional racism nurtured by historical discrimination, which is expressed, among others, by violence, hate speech, exploitation, stigmatisation and the most blatant kind of discrimination.\u201d See ECRI (2011), On Combating Anti-Gypsyism and Discrimination against Roma, September 2011. 966 EP 2017: Report on Fundamental Rights Aspects in Roma Integration in the EU: Fighting Anti- Gypsyism (2017/2038(INI)); Chopin, Isabelle, Catharina Germaine, and Judit Tanczos 2017: Roma and the Enforcement of Anti-Discrimination Law , Brussels. http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=47560; FRA 2018: A persisting concern: anti-Gypsysm as a barrier to Roma inclusion, Vienna http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2018/roma-inclusion; Carrera, Sergio, Iulius Rostas, and Lina Vosyli\u016bt\u0117. 2017.

Reports suggest that there is a need to distinguish between the social exclusion due to poverty and the civic violation of rights due to discrimination, even though there is an overlap between the two (i.e. some Roma may be both socially excluded due specifically to discrimination). 967 This needs to be taken into account in policy design. To support the above, the following is recommended: \uf09f NRIS should define specific objectives on reducing discrimination in key areas of social life and include concrete measures aimed at tackling hate crime and hate speech caused by anti-Gypsyism. \uf09f Discrimination, as a driver to economic inequality and poverty, could also be incorporated in a post-2020 EU coordination mechanism on economic policies, such as the present European Semester Process. \uf09f The FRA could support European institutions and Member States in the formulation of priorities or design of policies by furthering their understanding about the specific ways and areas in which discrimination impedes social inclusion of the Roma. \uf09f While the funding linked to anti-discrimination and anti-Gypsyism within a potential future successor of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship (REC) programme could be further strengthened, anti-discrimination could be \u2018mainstreamed\u2019 not only in European Structural and Investment Funds but also in Cohesion Funds, particularly in thematic areas targeting employers, educational, health institutions, or housing authorities. \uf09f Member States should ensure addressing anti-Gypsyism in all Roma related policies/programmes/projects as cross-cutting element. After 2020, the European Commission should work towards an enhanced framework which should maintain the four priority areas, but specify an individually adaptable set of targets within the areas per country and consider including some new specific objectives. To this end, country specific targets could be set up by Member States from a more detailed list of optional targets per area provided by a potential renewed EU Framework (differentiated targets in a common framework). Member States should develop \u2018second generation\u2019 NRIS, updating their objectives and prioritise according to their national and Roma particular circumstances. The Framework needs to provide a flexible yet harmonised set of objectives and optional targets to be able to better take into account the heterogeneity of the Roma population and their differentiated needs, in addition to the country-specific situation and needs. While objectives and targets are valid for all countries, including enlargement countries, the different country contexts and the diversity of Roma situations have led to the following recommendations: \uf09f A joint planning framework, allowing for the national adaptation of a shared set of targets, could improve the quality of NRIS. (1) The objectives of NRIS need to be specified and disaggregated, including nationally adapted targets for sub- sectors. (2) The objectives should identify specific, quantified and time-bound targets in each area that will be detailed according to country situations (differentiated targets in a common framework). (3) Targets should be absolute, as well as relative in relation to the general population to work towards reducing 967 Alliance against Antigypsyism. 2017. Antigypsyism - a Reference Paper.

(4) Gender inequalities and gender specific needs should be more present in the future set of targets. \uf09f Planning and target setting needs to include quality criteria. Measures can be implemented in different ways and tailored to national and local specificities, but they should be developed and implemented based on the Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion, 968 in particular Principles 1 (constructive, pragmatic and non-discriminatory policies), 2 (explicit but not exclusive targeting), 5 (awareness of the gender dimension) and 10 (active involvement of Roma). A forward looking evaluation of the NRIS, which includes gatherings of lessons learnt, is the necessary condition for drafting the second generation NRIS. \uf09f NRIS should be updated according to the needs, the situation of specific groups and the increasing diversity of Roma situations and trends within Member States and Enlargement countries. In this sense, the EU Framework needs to be more sensitive and include specific provisions to particular sub-groups: (1) children, with regard consideration in health, housing, and education inclusion policies; child protection, or countering of trafficking in human beings; (2) the special disadvantages of Roma women and girls (often victims of multiple discrimination); (3) migrant Roma from third countries, including stateless Roma; (4) mobile Roma who migrate between EU Member States. The situation of both EU-mobile citizens and third country nationals, particularly within EU15, is a matter of concern, which needs explicit measures in the strategies and human rights-based practices, to avoid evictions and expulsions of non-national Roma. 969 The sector objectives are still relevant but need to be adjusted in terms of weight and in the definition of sub-sectors. \uf09f In education , even though current priorities such as ECEC and care and compulsory education completion should remain important, early-school leaving rates, participation and completion levels in secondary education, access to vocational training (with special relevance for Roma women and girls) and school segregation, should be pointed out. More focus needs to be spent on the transition from ISCED2 to ISCED3 and higher. \uf09f In employment , school-to-work transition and quality vocational training are a priority given the high rate of Roma NEETs. Persisting high levels of discrimination in finding work or at the work place should be addressed also via policies, not simply judicial remedies; specific measures to encourage or facilitate employment of Roma in public administration. Policy measures to increase employment levels of Roma women who are NEET should also be considered. 970 \uf09f In health , access to universal health care insurance coverage remains a priority. This includes ensuring preventive health measures, in particular for women, children, and people with disabilities, in both targeted and mainstream provision. Increased understanding of the health situation of the Roma is needed to better formulate priorities. Member States and the European Commission should 968 The 10 Common Basic Principles (CBP) on Roma Inclusion were annexed to the Council conclusions of 8 June 2009. These are: 1) constructive, pragmatic and non-discriminatory policies, 2) explicit but not exclusive targeting, 3) inter-cultural approach, 4) aiming for the mainstream, 5) awareness of the gender dimension, 6) transfer of evidence-based policies, 7) use of EU instruments, 8) involvement of regional and local authorities, 9) involvement of civil society, and 10) active participation of Roma. They have been replicated in the annex of the 2016 report of the Court of Auditors. 969 The issue of housing and forced eviction is commented in detail in UN-OHCHR 2017: Lessons Learned: Views in the Context of Mid-Term Review of Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2012-2020, Brussels 970 On Strengthening Roma Inclusion in Public Procurement see UN-OHCHR 2017: Lessons Learned: Views in the Context of Mid-Term Review of Implementation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies 2012-2020, Brussels ",

Specific highly deteriorated micro-regions or segregated urban areas could be declared of specific European interest, with respective incentives. The EU could provide added value by providing targeted support through priority programmes through ESIF/ERDF or Cohesion Funds to some highly deprived areas. 973 After 2020, the four priority areas should be framed into a coherent policy design. Member States should adopt integrated approaches and ensure that social protection systems and policies address the different needs of vulnerable subgroups, and in particular those subject to multiple forms of discrimination. Whilst the focus on the four priority sectors has helped to orient the priorities, other areas that could benefit from focused attention are: \uf09f Roma empowerment and civic participation would benefit from dedicated measures to strengthen the voice of Roma in the policy process. This ranges from community action support to scientific and academic research, as well as involving regional and local authorities and local civil society. Specific action towards fostering remembrance of the Roma Genocide and supporting a pan- European articulation of Roma culture form part of this. 974 \uf09f Poverty reduction as a horizontal objective has lost weight against the sectors. While all four policy areas of education, employment, health and housing are important determinants of poverty, a more focused approach that takes into account other determinants of poverty and support measures (e.g. social protection policies) should be considered. \uf09f Trafficking in human beings : Ensuring a coordinated effort in the EU action between the post- 2020 NRIS and EU legal and policy framework on trafficking in human beings is essential. Better coherence between NRIS and national anti- trafficking policies is needed, either by inclusion of trafficking-specific objectives and measures in the NRIS, or by ensuring coherence between national anti- trafficking policies and NRIS. Policy measures in the four main EU Framework sectors have strong prevention effect on trafficking in human beings and synergies need to be established. 971 A creation of a critical mass of expertise might concentrate much of the dispersed research and evidence. A number of existing initiatives, some of them in cooperation with WHO or ECDC, could feed into this focus. See the existing Roma health Initiatives of the WHO Europe Office http://www.euro.who.int/en/health- topics/health-determinants/roma-health 972 The Commission already has already formulated guidelines on the use of ESI Funds that are sufficiently detailed to move towards effective housing operations, see EC 2015: Guidance for Member States on the use of European Structural and Investment Funds in tackling educational and spatial segregation, Brussels http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/guidelines/2015/guidance-for-member- states-on-the-use-of-european-structural-and-investment-funds-in-tackling-educational-and-spatial- segregation; EC 2011: Guidance note on the implementation of integrated housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities under the ERDF, Brussels http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/cocof/2010/cocof_10_0024_01_en.pdf ; 973 Such as Lunik IX in Kosice, SK, Ferentari district in Bucharest, RO or rural areas at the Slovak-Hungarian Border. 974 OSCE 2015.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 221 5.3 Programming criteria and funding systems NRIS in the future need to be prioritise policies that are ambitious in terms of scale and depth: large scale policies that reach critical mass of the Roma or targeted sub-groups and have long-term effects. The trend should be towards human rights- based programming, with more focus on building systems and changing mainstream provision, as opposed to single action projects. Moving from a project-based approach to long-term, systemic and mainstreamed policies on Roma inclusion will require careful, evidence-based design that allows for scalability. Targeted and mainstream approaches should go hand in hand , and take account of the following: \uf09f Mainstream programmes have to incorporate an inclusive approach. Mainstream policies in the key areas of education, employment, health and housing need to be inclusive to all Roma in order to avoid discrimination. This means that they have to reach Roma, and, more importantly, \u2018compensate\u2019 for their disadvantages so that Roma have, proportionally, the same degree of access. \uf09f Targeted programmes, on the other hand, should be devised to compensate for specific Roma disadvantages. Explicit but not exclusive programmes and projects need to compensate for the disadvantages of the Roma according to their specific needs and have to provide additional support to ensure their effective equal access to rights and mainstream public services. These programmes should not exclude other vulnerable groups. 975 Timeframe 2018-2020 Member states should evaluate their ongoing NRIS to ensure learning uptake by both public, social and private actors on the relevance and effectiveness of programming principles and the degree of adherence. This would allow for an improved future NRIS that are more relevant to Roma and societal needs; it will help Member States to have a more informed position in the discussion of the future of the EU Framework; and ultimately it will contribute to more effective future inclusion policies. The Commission should promote existing and develop further guidance, train managing authorities and actors and assess the adherence to programming principles. 976 975 These conditions for smart programming have been agreed upon within the framework of the Common Basic Principles; Council of the European Union 2009: Council Conclusions on Inclusion of the Roma, Luxembourg. www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/lsa/108377.pdf; see OSF 2014: Toolkit on Programming the Structural Funds for Roma Inclusion in 2014-20.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 222 In detail the following actions could be taken immediately: \uf09f Member States should be encouraged to better streamline their different funding streams, including national or municipal funding into an integrated, holistic set of measures to tackle Roma inclusion, in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of Roma. \uf09f The use of instruments such as Country-Specific Recommendations (CSR) under the European Semester has proved to be effective. 977 This European Commission should further assess whether other EU Member States may also need Roma specific actions in order for the EU to meet the 2020 target of lifting 20 million out of risk of poverty and social exclusion. \uf09f The EC and Member States should make further use of existing monitoring mechanisms, including civil society monitoring, to make sure that the funds are efficiently spent and that they have the desired effect on Roma. This could be done via ad-hoc mid-term evaluations or civil society monitoring of major multi- year projects under implementation. The EU framework should continue to strengthen its coherence with relevant EU policies. The EU Framework is coherent overall with other EU policies, such as the Youth Guarantee, Skills Agenda, VET and the Alliance for Apprenticeships, and Investing in Children. However, in the four policy areas \u2013 education, employment, health and housing \u2013 the evidence reviewed suggests that the EU Framework is not fully taken up in these EU policies. Roma inclusion is mentioned, but linking the agendas operationally with Roma inclusion both at DG level and on the ground seems challenging. Furthermore, in the future the EU framework and NRIS should be framed within the upcoming initiatives on social policies, namely the European Pillar of Social Rights as well as the Sustainable Development Goals framework. The EU framework has triggered political attention and has created national level planning, implementation and measurement frameworks embedded in wider consultation procedures. Having achieved this, EU action could retreat gradually from routine implementation and focus more strategically in applying its means, both political and financial. Whilst consolidating the achievements, the EU action could additionally focus on issues that are beyond the reach of Member States, for example by creating innovative social policy or seeking to achieve a multiplier effect by generating knowledge. Amongst this is clearly the support to EU-level exchanges, such as specific networks of Roma issues or students exchange in the ERASMUS+ framework. The Roma Platform could be rebooted with a more transformative design by focusing its agenda on relevant EU policies. The EU Roma Network could play a stronger role by supporting the alignment between NRIS and ESIF implementation at MS level. Timeframe 2020 onwards After 2020, all national strategies should be planned according to SMART 978 programming principles. NRIS in the future should detail both how their respective education, employment, health and housing policies will be inclusive towards Roma, and what explicit measures will be developed to overcome specific disadvantages and ensure effective equal access of Roma in the different areas.

The NRIS need to be framed in the emerging consensus on EU social policies and, at the national level, translate these policies into practice with longer term programmes, more integration, more up-scaling, reaching of a critical mass of the Roma population, and local engagement for achieving impacts. Future NRIS must be part of a broader narrative of inclusive structural reform that benefits all discriminated and excluded groups. Framing Roma issues within the agenda of the European Pillar of Social Rights and their targets will allow Roma to be visualised for both audiences focussed on non- discrimination and social inclusion. NRIS should be allocated sufficient funds for their implementation. After 2020, second-generation NRIS should detail the budget allocations and account for expenditures in annual reports. EU Funds should be better aligned with NRIS. At the national level, more comprehensive connections between funds and strategies need to be established. Moreover, there is strong evidence to suggest that funds invested thus far are thoroughly insufficient to solving the current needs for social inclusion. Furthermore, national strategies cannot be funded almost exclusively by European funds, as is the case in some countries. \uf09f NRIS\u2019 Action Plans should include an explicit and detailed budget commitment, and implementation reports should provide account of the budget implementation. \uf09f The links between EU political and financial priorities and the EU Roma Framework should be further strengthened. \uf09f The EU needs to be more proactive in providing incentives for Member State to implement the policies in their NRIS (eg. additional funding upon reaching certain NRIS milestone targets). The EU\u2019s existing organisational, technical and financial capacities need to be aligned in order to strengthen and communicate such incentives. This requires effective inter-service coordination between DG JUST, DG EMPL. DG REGIO and the ESIF managing authorities. \uf09f Key departments of line Ministries at the national level (education, employment, health, and housing) should be involved in the planning of the NRIS and specify key legal and funding measures they will use for the Roma integration. \uf09f NRIS should present in a consistent manner an analysis of how their respective social protection systems \u2013 in areas such as minimum income, access to support and benefits \u2013 are inclusive to Roma, and provide incentives for activation and inclusion. The upcoming multi-annual financial framework (MFF) should be connected to the policy priorities of the future EU Roma Framework. ESIF Regulations should more explicitly refer to the eligibility of interventions for Roma by both keeping a specific investment priority on Roma and also by including references in relevant general objectives related to education, employment, social inclusion and housing. Ex-ante conditionality should include further obligations with regards to the quality of second-generation NRIS. These should include quantitative targets by areas, monitoring systems and guidance on programming principles (smart combination of mainstream policies and the explicit but not exclusive actions, see above) and measures for combating all forms of discrimination and promoting equal opportunities.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 224 5.4 Governance and working structures 979 The working structures at EU and national level need to be consolidated and the architecture needs further completion in the future. At European level, governance structures have been managed through the structures of the Roma Team in DG Justice and the Roma Task Force with its linkages to different DGs, 980 the Network of NRCPs, the European Platform for Roma Inclusion, and the FRA that supported systems of EU monitoring and knowledge management. In order to increase and deepen the system in the future, new steps have to be taken to ensure that: \uf09f Interdepartmental coordination and partnerships intensify. A more qualitative, focused and operational approach across DGs could include new EU and national actors, particularly those responsible for mainstream policies. \uf09f The positive dynamic of EU level cooperation with an involvement of all relevant stakeholders in the Strategy, including civil society and international organisations and academia, should continue in the future by increasing participation in the monitoring and evaluation processes, with a more focused and operational agenda and by supporting synergies. Transparency towards CSOs needs to be increased. \uf09f Cooperation between policy makers, researchers, social intervention practitioners and Roma activists needs to be further encouraged. To this end, the agenda of Roma Platforms, seminars and other events should be more focused on specific topics and events, and be more results-oriented. Furthermore, current exchanges and debates could give way to more pragmatic joint actions and initiatives. Roma inclusion issues need to be more present in all relevant EU policies notably in education, employment, social inclusion, and justice. EU and national level responsibilities should be made explicit, in line with the challenges and qualitative steps proposed for the future of the strategies: \uf09f The Pilar of Social Rights is very relevant for Roma and should take into account their needs in its implementation. \uf09f The EU could play an important role in the next phase by pushing Member States to make a connection between the NRIS and sectorial policies at the national level, by mentioning Roma in sectoral policies and by monitoring their implementation. \uf09f There is a need for improved coordination at all levels and especially with the NRCP. Suggested improvements include: more structured dialogue; an agenda focused on specific issues to avoid repetition of debates; provision of advice and technical support by the Commission; support to bilateral or multilateral thematic working groups; facilitating a forum for exchange and mutual learning, etc. A better preparation and follow-up of the meetings are areas for specific improvement. At national level, the NRCPs should be strengthened in terms of mandate, institutional capacity, human resources and budget. NRCP have to move from nominal units to efficient advocates for the mainstreaming of Roma inclusion within all relevant policy areas and engage key departments at national level in the process. 979 In this section, a distinction between the 2018-20 timeframe and the post-2020 framework has not been made, as the recommendations focus specifically on the deepening of the existing structures and a linking up with collateral structures, and are thus both relevant to the short and the longer term. 980 Besides JUST, the DGs EAC, EMPL, REGIO, SANT, AGRI, NEAR, HOME form part of the Roma taskforce. FRA is also part. Other DGs - SG, BUDG, RTD, ECFIN, COM \u2013 are involved when needed. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 225 Taking into account the administrative organisation and specificities of each country, the NRCPs need to be strengthened in their mandate, capacity and means to: \uf09f Ensure a permanent dialogue in working with departments which are relevant for Roma integration, in order to foster more involvement form their side; \uf09f Work in close alignment with authorities responsible for managing ESIF; \uf09f Have the capacity and adequate structures to work with regional and local level actors; \uf09f Involve all relevant actors in National Roma policies; \uf09f Strengthen the system of consultation and dialogue with Roma civil society organisations and count on their support and means for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the progress of the NRIS. Possibly, this dialogue should be scheduled alongside the budgeting cycle and Semester process. \uf09f Strengthen local level capacity (or local or regional government administrations) to implement NRIS. To achieve this, the NRCP will require more intensive support from the European Commission, with a more focused and pragmatic agenda in the meetings and improvements to the annual system of reporting. DG JUST, in coordination with the respective DGs, should encourage the NRCP to engage other key departments at national level in the process. At both European and national levels, Roma organisations should count on better support and participation. Effective Roma engagement at all levels must be continued and the agenda built around future challenges of the EU framework, in order to build a cumulative knowledge-base and avoid repetitions of deliberations. The European Commission and Member States need to ensure the participation of Roma CSOs in the policy process, especially in design, implementation and monitoring: \uf09f The Commission and Member States should guarantee quality participation, including capacity-building, empowerment and training of Roma CSOs. For this to happen core funding should be assigned. \uf09f Roma CSOs need to be included in the design of mainstream policies, as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of these. \uf09f Permanent strong civil society monitoring structures with adequate resources to increase transparency and interactions are necessary for participation and democratic oversight. European Institutions and Member States should support the strengthening of civil society organisation capacity, without affecting their political and financial independence. 5.5 Monitoring, reporting and measuring Each NRIS should have its own comprehensive monitoring and reporting system. Despite the efforts made by the Roma Team and the FRA and despite some progress at national level, monitoring and reporting systems associated with the Roma Strategies are still weak and need substantial improvement. NRIS monitoring and reporting system must be both consistent with their own administrative procedure, whilst also being compatible with the EU Framework and able to provide information at policy and programme level in the context of: (1) Information on explicit targeted actions/programmes that have been developed in the framework of the strategy, such as budget, beneficiaries, results and (2) Actions undertaken for promoting more inclusive mainstream policies with Roma in the key areas, including results/impact at population level.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July, 2018 226 So far, countries have only been asked to report on process indicators. In order to measure overall development and effectiveness of the interventions in a post- 2020 scenario, EU MS and enlargement and neighbourhood countries should also report on results and outcome indicators. Besides common indicators, MS should provide an assessment based on solid data on the situation and develop their targets, including outcome indicators, accordingly to their respective needs. NRISs should be able to explain how they will measure results in a consistent manner. A critical concern for measuring results is that there is no baseline for setting indicators. Member States have argued on the practical and legal difficulties for collecting ethnically disaggregated data in most countries. However, no legal obstacle exists against voluntary self-declaration which could circumvent the reluctance of the Roma to declare their identity. Based on the Council Recommendation, the FRA has made substantial progress in this field. At European level, it is possible to gather quantitative data from many countries, while for the rest other means of gathering information are in place. Additionally, new initiatives are in place related to municipalities. The EU, including Eurostat and the FRA, should assist in this task. Timeframe 2018-2020 At the EU level the current annual reporting system and its tool needs to be refined to present an updated picture of the outcomes of the NRIS. The current Roma reporting tool is a positive step but presents several weaknesses. Improvements suggested include the following: \uf09f The annual reporting obligation for Member States, established as of 2016, should be transparent and public, while feedback and recommendations loop beyond NRCPs and the EU Roma Team, to include the respective national line Ministries and DGs; based on the Structure-Process-Outcome (SPO) indicator framework proposed by the FRA and on the current experience. 981 \uf09f EU institutions should continue to strengthen information systems and data collection in all areas at Member State level in order to track progress. Possible improvements of the annual reporting tool could include: (1) collecting more qualitative information to provide context to the data provided and help to provide a commentary when data is missing; (2) ensuring data availability and appropriate disaggregation at the local level to ensure appropriate data exists to monitor implementation, achievement and efficiency; (3) including subnational actors, both regional and municipal, in targeted capacity building efforts to improve the quality and reliability of the reporting tool; (4) ensuring that the monitoring and policy guidance issued by the Commission is specific, concrete and focussed and reflects the specific national guidance; (5) include user- oriented feedback-loops in order to signal to those technicians that are charged with data inputting that the tool has a meaningful outlet. In the future framework, NRIS should strive towards reliable ethnically disaggregated data collection. Specifically, NRIS should be able to: \uf09f Define specific quantitative targets according to their national situation. \uf09f Define how they will report on its respective specific quantitative targets. \uf09f Collect gender disaggregated data. Monitoring and evaluation systems should be strengthened by different means after 2020.

It is necessary to increase the accountability of all stakeholders, which requires a long-term stable monitoring and evaluation systems: \uf09f The EC should promote data collection, including data on ethnicity, with the support of the FRA. It should continue systematically involving other EU agencies in completing and contrasting data. \uf09f FRA surveys should allow for monitoring of the main objectives of the EU Framework (i.e. allowing to assess gaps between Roma and majority populations (not \u2018populations living nearby\u2019, as at present).

Bulgaria or Hungary). \uf09f Independent and external regular evaluations should be ensured based on participatory methodologies including Roma community members. \uf09f An evaluability assessment should be undertaken to identify the returns of social investments of the NRIS and also on losing human capital and social opportunities by not investing. 982 \uf09f The Commission should continue to support the Roma Civil Monitor and other monitoring mechanisms that ensure that civil society can fulfil a key function as watchdog monitor and serve as a comparison to the data reported by member states. More specific methodological guidance and structure could be provided to organisation undertaking civil monitoring to ensure comprehensive monitoring of all EU Framework objectives, and objective validity of results. \uf09f Monitoring systems after 2020 should move from process indicators to outcome indicators. \uf09f After 2020, enlargement and neighbourhood countries should continue to be covered initiatives (such as surveys or civil society monitoring) to monitor their progress towards achieving their NRIS objectives. 5.6 Bench-marking, policy learning, and cooperation Up to now, the principal actors in the cooperation between the European Commission and the Member States were the Roma Team and the NRCP. Occasionally, FRA has engaged with the Member States and other DGs in supporting data collection and strengthening human rights monitoring. In line with the new challenges proposed for the EU framework there is a need for a more systematic and permanent agenda that engages key actors.

This agenda should be developed in close cooperation with the NRCP, and engage relevant DGs, the FRA and the key departments responsible for Roma integration at national level, together with the cooperation of other actors. \uf09f The agenda should provide political guidance to devise a renewed Framework for second generation NRIS, based on the existing experience and knowledge and the shortfalls and strengths in the implementation of the NRIS. Therefore both national level NRIS evaluations and the Framework evaluation should provide specific evidence that could feed into the definition of a post-2020 scenario including its tools. \uf09f Other European Union institutions, namely the Council Presidency Trios and the Parliament, have to be closely involved. \uf09f The agenda should focus on the specific priorities of the strategies in the future, specifically the priorities for improving the situation in the four key areas, effective anti-discrimination policies and efficiency of legal instruments, better implementation of ESIF/IPA and NDICI funds, improving systems of monitoring and data collection, etc. \uf09f The agenda should progress towards a more pragmatic approach and dialogue by focussing on specific issues and avoiding repetition of debates. \uf09f The Commission should facilitate that NRCPs engage in exchanges (including bilaterally), to ensure that Europe-wide best practices are effectively channelled and local solutions are promoted elsewhere. NRCPs should be encouraged to cascade such information on a systematic basis to the national stakeholders. \uf09f The agenda should create the bases for discussing in detail, based on the mid- term evaluation, the concrete improvement for challenges post-2020. This evaluation points to a rather incremental approach of consolidating the achievements, fine-tuning the priorities, governance structures and implementation instruments and transition to a second generation NRIS framework based on the explicit lessons learnt. Timeframe post 2020 The European Commission (DG Just) should systematically support the policy learning and to foster the cooperation between Members States and through DG NEAR to countries in the enlargement and neighbourhood regions. The Roma Team has focused until now on the monitoring of the strategy, preparation of communications, events, etc. In the future, an additional crucial role will be to support the policy learning and to foster the cooperation between Member States, and enlargement and neighbourhood countries through DG NEAR. Its role and mandate as facilitator has to be strengthened. The EU Roma Network represents a key transmission belt for these activities, which could be reinforced. This can be done by different means, such: \uf09f Supporting mutual learning by organising workshops, debates, seminars, etc. and strengthening capacities through training activities. Specific issues need to be identified because results may be challenging (e.g. housing and resettlement) or specific expert knowledge may be needed (e.g. VET). \uf09f Promoting the exchange of experiences, exchange of good practices and facilitating the transfer of experiences that have demonstrated success in order to analyse how similar problems may have similar or different solutions according to contexts. \uf09f Support the coproduction of working methods and working tools by engaging experts and activists.

In that sense, their work also contributes to the systematisation of knowledge and exchange of practices, amongst others with equality bodies. The FRA has the capacity to train and guide in monitoring and provide guidance and transfer know-how on fundamental rights issues related to Roma (i.e. supporting in data collection, in piloting experiences, field training in rights monitoring etc.).

Clarification of the information needed for estimating the cost (value) of an IO (price of the required administrative activity on an IO): \uf09f Time (T) \u2013 the number of hours each need to perform required actions for implementing an IO.

The time in the administrative cost calculation relates to all activities relating to the Roma framework (reporting etc.) and to coordinate the implementation of the NRIS in each Member State. Where no information was provided in the reporting tool or qualitative interviews, it was assumed that a single individual worked on the NRIS (the NRCP). Information in the reporting tool indicated that there were 164 individuals responsible for NRIS. It was assumed that these individuals worked full time on NRIS.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July 2018 233 Sensitivity analysis for financial information There is a degree of uncertainty around the expenditure on Roma inclusion in the EU taken from the reporting tool. This is because some Member States provided expenditure information, whereas others provided no values for expenditure \u2013 this means it is unclear if they spent nothing on Roma integration or if they could not estimate a value. Additionally, all the financial information is self-reported, and it is unclear what activities are included in the spending data in each country, if this is consistent across countries and if the data is accurate (as it is self-reported). To reflect this uncertainty, a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken. This uses information about the estimated size of the Roma population, the number of ESF beneficiaries, data on national expenditure by category (taken from Eurostat) and qualitative information from each nation to assess whether the spending was accurate, and to vary some of the information provided. The sensitivity analysis for the financial information used the following data manipulations to provide high and low estimates for the total level of spending on Roma inclusion : \uf09f Total Government expenditure by category for the whole population was collected from Eurostat. The Government expenditure was multiplied by the proportion of the total population which is Roma, to estimate the expected amounts MS spend on these measures for Roma. This was done to provide a baseline measure against which the reported national expenditure could be compared against, to examine if the reported values appeared to be realistic. The Roma population may have less access to mainstream measures than the general population, therefore different spending scenarios were explored. The scenarios where on average the Roma population access half of the mainstream measures that would be expected (if they accessed mainstream measures in the same way as the rest of the population), and where the Roma population accessed one third of the mainstream measures that would be expected have been explored. \uf09f These scenarios were compared to the total expenditure for Roma inclusion reported in the online reporting tool, to test the robustness of the reported expenditure. This analysis showed that generally, the reported level of expenditure on Roma integration was below one third of the expected Government spending on the Roma population for these measures . This suggests that, with some notable exceptions, the reported levels of total expenditure are realistic. \uf09f The exceptions to this, where the online reporting expenditure seems unrealistically high, are: - Housing expenditure in HU and SK in 2016; and in RO in 2015. However, this could be due to infrastructure investments which are reported elsewhere in the national accounts. - Health expenditure in HU in 2015, which is reported to be nearly half the total mainstream expenditure on health for the whole population; - Education expenditure in the UK, which is reported to be five times the size of the expected expenditure for the Roma population. The inflated value of housing expenditure in Hungary is the result of very high targeted expenditure. The remaining reported values for targeted expenditure are very small in comparison to the estimated Government spending on the Roma population (both reported and in the scenario analysis), therefore there is no reason to assume that this data is significantly inflated. However, it is likely that targeted funding is under-reported in the EU as a whole, as many nations have reported no targeted spend. ",
        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July 2018 234 To provide the estimated monetary values in the sensitivity analysis of targeted spending , the following assumptions have been made: \uf09f In a low estimate, the targeted expenditure for education in HU in 2015 has been excluded from the analysis. The estimated spent for housing in RO in 2015 has also been removed. Where a Member State has not responded, it is assumed that there is no spending on Roma inclusion. \uf09f In the low estimate, where Member States report that there has been no targeted spending, it has been assumed that there is no spending. \uf09f In the high estimate, where a Member State has reported no spending, it is assumed that the mainstream spending is one third of the expected mainstream measure spending on Roma, multiplied by the ratio of targeted to mainstream spending taken from the national reporting tool. \uf09f Where Member States have not responded, the same assumption has been made. \uf09f Finally, the estimation of FEAD programme funding for the Roma population is based on an assumption that 10% of the \u201cmigrants, participants with a foreign background, minorities (including marginalised communities such as the Roma)\u201d category is targeted at the Roma population. In the sensitivity analysis, this assumption has been varied. In the low estimate, a 5% assumption has been used; in the high estimate 15% of FEAD spending for ethnic minorities is assumed to be spent on Roma integration. The sensitivity analysis provides a low estimate of the level of targeted expenditure of EUR 29 million in 2015 and EUR 34 million in 2016; and a high estimate of EUR 424 million in 2015 and EUR 157 million in 2016 . A sensitivity analysis of the direct cost of the EU Framework and NRIS (the administrative cost) is also subject to a degree of uncertainty, and a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken. The assumptions that have been varied in this sensitivity analysis were: \uf09f In the low estimate, staff members were assumed to work 50% of their time on the EU Framework and NRIS; the other 50% of their time was spent working on other tasks not related to the Framework or NRIS. \uf09f In the low estimate, the labour cost was assumed to be 90% of the labour cost reported in Eurostat; \uf09f In the low estimate, staff were assumed to work the average number of hours per year as reported in Eurostat; \uf09f In the high estimate, staff members were assumed to work 100% of their time on the EU framework and NRIS. \uf09f In the high estimate, the labour cost was assumed to be 110% of the labour cost reported in Eurostat; and \uf09f In the high estimate, staff were assumed to work the 110% of the average number of hours per year as reported in Eurostat. \uf09f The calculation of the administrative cost in the sensitivity analysis follows the same approach as for the main analysis.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July 2018 235 Method for calculation of potential benefits The spending on Roma integration in the areas of Education, Employment, Health and Housing can lead to multiple economic and social benefits. Where possible, these have been quantified and monetised. The economic and social benefits are described below. ECEC results in better educational attainment, employment prospects and future earnings . Better integration with children from other backgrounds, reduces social inequalities. The positive effects of early school education has been explored in several studies, which found that children who participate in early education remain in education longer. In turn, the effect of children remaining in education longer is an increased probability of being in employment and higher average earnings once they are employed. The effect of an extra year in education is estimated to be an additional 10% of earnings. 984 This increase in earnings has been applied in the calculation here. However, this assumes that the quality and quantity of ECEC provided for Roma children is comparable to the quality and quantity of ECEC for the general population. Early School Leavers face barriers in entering the labour market (obtaining a job) and on average have lower earnings once they are employed. Additionally, their levels of health and wellbeing and social participation are lower than those who remain in school, which generate additional social costs. 985 The economic cost of ESL per year is assumed to be the same as the cost per NEET per year, which is presented below. In the evidence reviewed, the identified costs of ESL and NEET are similar, and the costs of being NEET and an ESL are often used as proxy measures for each other 986 . The change in the number of Roma who are ESL has been multiplied by the annual cost of being NEET to estimate the annual costs of changes in ESL in the Roma population. Individuals who remain in education for more years are less likely to commit criminal acts, therefore improving the participation rate and duration of time spent in education can lead to a reduction in criminal activity. Better educational achievement leads to an improved economic activity (and labour market participation), increased levels of income and better community engagement. All of these factors are associated with individuals being less likely to commit crime. Therefore, there is a negative relationship between educational achievement and criminal activity (as education increases, criminal activity decreases). 987 This is not necessarily a causal relationship. Data on the number of crimes reported to the police show that in 2015, an estimated 12 million crimes were committed in the EU. The value of the crimes committed is estimated to be EUR 120 billion (including the cost to society, victims and the judicial system). 988 Changes in the employment rate of Roma individuals . By supporting Roma individuals into paid employment, there is an economic benefit to the Roma community (through increased earnings). There is also a benefit to the Member State Government, as moving individuals into paid employment increases the amount of tax received.

The cost per NEET for each Member State was converted to 2016 values using GDP deflators. 990 These costs are presented in the table below. The costs included in the analysis are the costs to the public purse (benefit payments) and private costs (income generated).

The FRA provides indicators for Roma inclusion in 2011 and 2016 \u2013 therefore the changes between these years can be estimated. The cost of Roma exclusion, and the benefits from reducing this exclusion, have been measured for: \uf09f Employment (the rate of employment and the rate of young people who are NEET); and \uf09f Education (Early school education and Early School Leavers). The economic benefits of improvements in housing and health have not been estimated, as there is no evidence of changes in these areas. On the issue of housing, most indicators do not show any changes, while the slight improvement in access to electricity could not be attributed to specific policies. In health, there is no reliable data to show changes in improved health status (in terms of increased life-expectancy or less work absenteeism and increased productivity). Some of the economic benefits that have been estimated (such as increases in earnings) will be supported by improvements in housing and health among the Roma population. 989 Eurofound (20015), Young People and \u2018NEETs\u2019 990 The Eurofound research does not provide an estimated cost of NEETs for HR.

        "Mid-term evaluation of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 July 2018 237 The values from the quantitative analysis of different benefits should not be summed together, as there is a degree of double counting of effects. The method used to estimate the effects and the results are presented below: A standard method was used to identify the change in the education and employment participation rates among the Roma. The change in the Roma participation rates between 2011 and 2016 have been examined in the first instance. This was calculated by subtracting the 2016 values from the 2011 values. Secondly, to try to explain how much of this change was in line with the general population and how much was specific to the Roma population, the changes in the rates for the Roma population were compared to the changes in the rates of the general population. This change was estimated as some of the changes among the Roma population will be driven by wider Government policies or economic conditions. For example, if the employment rate among the general population decreased because of weak economic performance, then it would be expected that the employment rate among the Roma population would also fall. Therefore, a decrease in the employment rate among the Roma population would not be due to Roma integration problems, but rather the economic performance of the Member State. The steps involved were: \uf09f To measure the change in the identified indicators for the general population using data from Eurostat by subtracting the 2011 values from the 2016 values. \uf09f The percentage point change in the general population was multiplied by the 2011 Roma value (taken from the FRA data) to estimate an expected Roma value in 2016 (assuming the indicator for the Roma changed in the same way as for the general population). \uf09f The expected Roma value for 2016 was subtracted from the actual observed value of the Roma indicator in 2016. This provided an estimate of how the Roma rate has increased/decreased above or below the rate of the general population. \uf09f The same approach has been used to estimate the change in indicators for the five expansion countries (AL, BA, ME, RS and MK), using UNDP-WB-European Commission data. It is important to note that the benefits of Roma integration discussed below estimate the benefits of Roma inclusion by changes in participation or achievement over time. These changes could have been caused by the introduction of the Roma framework, or by other external factors. It has not been possible to estimate the benefits directly attributable to the introduction of the Roma framework. Employment The rate of employment among the Roma population increased significantly in two Member States between 2011 and 2016, (HU and PT) 991 , but has decreased in all enlargement countries (see figure below). The rate of employment among the Roma population increased at a faster pace than in the general population in three of the countries where data is available (EL, HU and PT, see Figure A1.10). In six Member States, employment in the Roma population is below the expected level (if it had changed at the same rate as the general population).

This shows that in the two Member States where the rate of employment of Roma individuals had improved compared to the general population, an additional 40,500 Roma individuals were employed. This would lead to an estimated increase in earnings of EUR 204 million for the Roma community and an extra EUR 54 million in tax receipts.
