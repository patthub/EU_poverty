        "Foreword The Committee of the Regions is a long-standing supporter of Fair Trade. This was clearly expressed in its 2010 opinion 1 drafted by Kerstin Kiessler (PES/DE), which recognized the role of Local and Regional Authorities \u201cas important players in a Fair Trade policy\u201d and also called for a \u201cEuropean Fair Trade Strategy\u201d to be launched and to be promoted and implemented at the local and regional, as well as at national and EU levels. Unfortunately, this call to action did not generate a concrete follow-up by the European Institutions as the CoR had hoped for and therefore we have decided to renew our call. 2015 being a landmark year for development at EU and at international level, the CoR sees it as an ideal opportunity to put this topic at the top of the EU agenda on sustainable development and accepted our proposal for an own-initiative opinion highlighting the role of local and regional authorities. The Lisbon Treaty grants the European Union an exclusive competence on trade. But it also establishes that, in its relations with the wider world, the EU should contribute to \u201cthe sustainable development of the Earth, solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights\u201d 2 . Furthermore, the Union is required to take account of the objective of poverty reduction and eradication in all actions likely to affect developing countries. Trade has a central role to play in today\u2019s economies: according to the World Trade Organization, since 2000 world trade has increased almost threefold. Trade exchanges are of key importance for the EU for two main reasons: first of all, the EU is the world's largest trading block, and 90% of the global growth in the next 20 years is expected to be generated outside of Europe 3 . The EU's main policy priority in trade is and will remain to seek greater liberalisation of markets through the removal of barriers to trade and granting of market access for European companies. This way trade can contribute to economic growth and job creation in the European Union. In an increasingly interconnected world, trade flows must also improve the living and working conditions of people both in Europe, and in the trading partner countries. Besides seeking open market access to third countries for European companies, the EU does encourage its trade counterparts to respect environmental and social standards. This is done by offering preferential EU market access to countries which ratify and implement international conventions relating to human and labour rights. Moreover, recent trade agreements signed by the EU include trade and sustainable development chapters. All these are positive steps in achieving a fairer trade system. However, the EU should not turn a blind eye to the reality in which most of the imported or processed goods are produced in third countries. Long and complex supply chains often fail to ensure a fair income for those at the beginning of the chain. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, small producers provide over 80 per cent of the food consumed in a large parts of the developing world. Despite their crucial role in feeding the world\u2019s growing population, small-scale farmers remain largely marginalized from world trade. Additional mechanisms should be put in place to allow should small producers in the developing countries to reap the benefits of the current trading system. Fair Trade is an easy way in which the EU can reconcile its trade and sustainability concerns. By promoting it, the EU does not contradict the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality by which all EU legislative and policy measures have to abide. The Committee of the Regions' own-initiative opinion expresses indeed the need for 1 Committee of the Regions Opinion \"Contributing to sustainable development: the role of Fair Trade and non-governmental trade-related sustainability assurance schemes\u201d COM (2009) 215 final. 10 February 2010 2 Article 3.5 of the Treaty on the European Union 3 Source: DG Trade website (cid:76) ",
        "a fully-fledged EU Fair Trade Strategy that mainstreams this concept across various EU policy areas: trade, development and sustainable consumption and production. The promotion of Fair Trade principles should be a collective objective of the European Union. That is why, to start with, the European Union should ensure that actors having the potential to promote Fair Trade (EU citizens, local authorities, public authorities, companies, consumers, civil society) have access to the information and the tools to do it, and that there are no major obstacles for them to support Fair Trade. There are already many examples of Fair Trade promotion at local and regional level: the Fair Trade Towns campaign gathers to date more than 1.500 communities in Europe. In some countries the concept of Fair Trade provinces and regions is also becoming very popular. Both Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom have declared themselves Fair Trade nations. In my country Germany, many of these good practices are encouraged by the German Fair Trade Capital award. That is why we think the EU should follow this initiative and launch a \u201cEuropean Fair Trade Capital\u201d scheme, similar to and building on already existing schemes that would give incentives to European municipalities to carry forward their commitments in Fair Trade. It would not only reward the various modalities of Fair Trade support by cities in Europe, it would also help to disseminate the good examples to encourage other cities to take action in this area. This Award should be part of a far-reaching proposal for the uptake of Fair Trade by public authorities, companies and consumers in the EU. In this way, citizens both in their role as voters and as economic actors can be made aware and make informed choices if they want to support fair trading principles. The existing local and regional support to Fair Trade so far depends, however, very much on the national context and the policy environment in which these authorities operate. This situation has been examined in the study commissioned by the CIVEX Commission and the main findings of which you will find in this publication. Based on comparing different national situations and identifying some common elements and problems, the study includes policy recommendations at EU, Member State and local and regional levels. The study shows that in order to promote Fair Trade effectively at EU level and thus have an effect also on the other levels of governance, a mix of regulatory and policy interventions across the EU landscape are needed. In the above mentioned own initiative opinion of the Committee of the Regions, recommendations are made as to how the regional and local governments in the EU can promote Fair Trade in their respective territories. This can be done by supporting awareness raising among the public and the economic actors, through the procurement of Fair Trade products, but also by encouraging the creation of Fair Trade businesses and networks. In particular, the exchange of good practices and the creation of learning communities in this filed should be encouraged. The European Portal of Decentralised Cooperation 4 offers a prime tool to this end. This publication includes a collection of practices from different local and regional entities in different fields such as awareness raising, public procurement and partnerships with the South. I am very happy about the wide variety of good ideas represented, and I would like to thank all the contributors as well as those colleagues who have contributed to this collection, because it does show that local and regional authorities all over the EU are active and committed in working towards a fairer global trade system. As mentioned earlier, the European Year for Development 2015 provides the right opportunity to push for an ambitious approach to Fair Trade, using it as a benchmark of greater coherence of all EU policies. In addition, the future United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals after 2015 must recognise the role of local authorities as \"enablers\" in development policy, 4 www.cor.europa.eu/portal (cid:76)(cid:76) ",
        "and the EU and its active local and regional levels should be at the forefront of this movement. In this context it is important to note that the recent European Commission Communication on the post-2015 development framework identifies trade as a key tool to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, besides recognizing the contribution of Fair Trade schemes to economic, environmental and social benefits. We need to build on that and hold the other EU institutions, but also our Member States to their words, by using the vast stock of experience which we have built up in our towns, cities and regions. In conclusion: the implementation of the new development framework at European, national, regional and local level will provide us with an excellent framework and challenge to pursue an ambitious stance on Fair Trade driven by the EU. I look forward to working with and through the Committee of the Regions, its members and its networks, but also with all of you for the follow-up of this important topic by the EU institutions.

        "1 Introduction The challenge Currently there is no EU-wide definition of fair trade but European institutions have converged over the definition of the Charter of Fair Trade Principles (2009) that: 'Fair Trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalised producers and workers \u2013 especially in the South. Fair Trade Organisations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.' 1 The academic and policy literature describes two complementary channels for fair trade marketing in EU Member States (MS): the 'integrated-supply route' under the World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO) and the \u2018product -certification route\u2019 b ased on the Fairtrade International (FLO). 2 Some examples based on the former route include the activities of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Artisans du Monde (FAM)\u2019s member local associations and worldshops 3 in France and Ctm Altomercato \u2019s distribution channels in Italy; while the latter has been seen as most successful in the UK where major supermarket chains have switched 'entire product lines to Fairtrade labelling' 4 . Fostering market growth in fair trade products and raising awareness has been achieved through diverse paths where one of the most widespread initiatives, involving mainly local, but also some regional authorities remains the 'Fair Trade Towns' campaign, started in Garstang in North West England. 5 Despite the differences of implementation across countries, fair trade has three basic components: 1 World Fair Trade Organization and Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, 2009.

",
        "2 a. Better terms of trade for the poorest within supply and distribution networks, and especially for producers of primary products in developing countries; b. Environmental sustainability; c. Improved social standards and social equity. Recently fair trade has become more mainstream in how some products are produced and marketed in the EU and a number of effective fair trade strategies and policies have been pursued at national and sub-national level. Existing documents guiding fair trade on European level include the 2009 European Commission Communication 'Contributing to sustainable development: the role of Fair Trade and non-governmental trade-related sustainability assurance schemes' recognised the presence of fair trade and the variety of approaches. 6 This was accompanied by the Committee of the Regions\u2019 opinion which called on the need to adopt a European Strategy and action programme for fair trade for Local and Regional Authorities (LRAs). 7 The Communication also recalled developments since 1999 when it first presented a report detailing the development of the sector, reviewed in the following section. Since 2009 the fair trade agenda on the EU level has temporarily lost momentum at the very moment that it had gained public, political and corporate credibility, and at a time when it can play a significant role in rebuilding the European economy and generating employment, both within the EU and in developing countries. Part of the exercise undertaken here was to identify what instruments to put in place at EU and MS level in order to unlock the full potential of LRAs in promoting fair trade. Approach and methodology The broad approach followed in this project has endeavoured to make a start in this respect, by taking stock of the experiences of different LRAs of the EU, and then identifying how some of the core lessons of this varied and rich set of experiences could be applied more widely and systematically across the EU. In short, we have tried to work out how the system could be scaled up to an EU level, drawing on what may broadly be called best practice. An evaluation of the relative effectiveness of these various strategies was not possible within the framework of this exercise, so we concentrated on trying to identify the various approaches adopted, which could be considered while exploring next steps. We have also considered these proposals with reference to other significant policies of the EU, namely, trade, competition, commercial, agricultural and other 6 COM (2009) 215 final. 7 Opinion of the Committee of the Regions of 10 February 2010 on Contributing to Sustainable Development: the Role of Fair Trade and Non-governmental Trade-related Sustainability Assurance Schemes (CdR 214/2009). ",
        "3 relevant policies, all of which need to be reconciled to the fair trade agenda. Material, information and references relating to the experiences of the LRAs was provided by the European Committee of the Regions (CoR), and these were supplemented by interviews and literature review. While this process generated a lot of material, demonstrating a complex mix of policy strategies and policy configurations, time and other constraints obviously limited the depth and detail of this exercise. Our observations with reference to these issues are summarised in the section on policy recommendations. In terms of the policy configurations, we start from a country classification due to the little available data on the sub-national level (see recommendations). In the process of grouping the countries, the note makes a differentiation between financial and political support from the different levels of governance, the role of LRAs, and consumer awareness and sales of fair trade certified products. The criteria used to loosely classify the countries reviewed are included below. 8 These criteria are used as guidance and the final classification has been based on discussions with LRAs and other stakeholders. - Estimated retail sales by country (latest available data, Fairtrade Foundation reports, see Annex 5). - Number of Fair Trade Towns (latest available data, Fair Trade Towns reporting, see Annex 2). - Degree of development of fair trade market and structures (literature review of policy and academic literature, collecting information on number of actors, activities and documents). - Legislative measures focusing explicitly on fair trade (literature review of selected legislative texts; interviews). - Presence of other activities dedicated to fair trade (literature review of policy and academic literature; interviews). - Development of fair trade policies on the sub-national level (literature review of policy and academic literature and interviews). The policy challenge in the context of the EU and its Member States is to identify, evaluate and implement the appropriate mix of regulatory, policy and market based approaches that work in mutual support of fair trade objectives. To be successful and accepted, this mix would have to simultaneously demonstrate that the overall package of measures succeeds in the following evaluation: - That WTO principles and rules relating to the EU\u2019s internal market principles and competition policy have been taken into account; 8 Due to the scope of the study, the expert team has not been able to be exhaustive in the review of all documents and has based its conclusion on those indicated in the study. ",
        "4 - That the options selected represent the most cost effective of the various alternatives; - That the principle of subsidiarity has been respected; - That the objectives of development in the exporting countries with respect to the three pillars of sustainable development are fully met, namely: o Economic viability o Social equity o Environmental sustainability. In this context the EU should reconcile its sustainability and trade liberalisation objectives by anticipating and addressing the stakeholders\u2019 concerns in an effective manner. Overall findings The broader macro-economic policy context within which all European states have to operate for the time being is going to remain difficult. The availability of resources for any major investment on the LRA level will continue to be problematic. At the same time, the commitment to rebuild Europe\u2019s economic model to reflect policy coherence and to align internal and external objectives provides a major opportunity to promote fair trade, sustainability and ethical objectives, but needs to be considered in the light of constraints on resources. Moreover, there is a question of whether an integrated fair trade agenda that currently links LRAs with developing countries will succeed in turning fair trade (with sustainability and ethical concerns) into a mainstream economic activity. If it is contemplated that this agenda will ultimately become an EU-wide agenda, then this needs to be made clear at the outset. Defining the level of ambition is therefore of paramount importance. As part of the process of determining the level of ambition, it would be necessary to back this with a strong economic and business case. That is: given the right policy and regulatory framework, it would be possible to assure high quality products at competitive prices, fully compatible with environmental and ethical concerns, while also ensuring fair returns to producers in developing countries. The second major finding is that further clarity regarding the objectives, principles and procedures relating to the fair trade agenda, especially where environmental and social issues are involved, needs to be defined and elaborated with greater precision. This would invariably be an ongoing process as the policy framework evolves, but it needs attention at every stage of policy implementation. ",
        "5 The third major finding is that this contemplated policy framework needs to be reconciled with existing and settled policy areas (agriculture, trade policy, commercial policy, neighbourhood policy), and must not find itself in conflict with regulatory provisions arising out of trade agreements, competition policy, and state aid rules. Inconsistencies would need to be ironed out and resolved as a matter of priority, and LRAs in particular would need access to legal and regulatory advice. The fourth major finding is with respect to information, monitoring and evaluation requirements. It goes without saying that information flows help improve decision making and project implementation, while consultation procedures are similarly enriched by higher quality data and information. Effective comparative studies, together with other sources of credible information, would form the basis for the quest for better policy and regulatory practice, assessments of what works and what does not (good practice), and awareness raising. For the business community, it would provide valuable inputs into designing business models, and where consumers are concerned, with information about trends, tastes, and interests. Improvements in EU-level information generation, monitoring and evaluation are therefore necessary and justified. The fifth major finding concerns national governments and their role in this overall arrangement. By and large, they have the resources and capacity to ensure that fair trade, environmental, ethical and developmental objectives are met. If there is clarity about the overall structure of the agenda flowing from the EU, then national governments can address many of the specific concerns of LRAs, consumers, and businesses, through other policy tools and mechanisms. Tax regimes, subsidies, regulations, infrastructure development and capacity building can all be addressed more effectively by national governments, and the section on policy recommendations elaborates this in further detail. In terms of structures and models, this study found that the EU level is in the best position to reconcile top-down and bottom-up approaches, essentially through an approach that looks at complementarity. This came through fairly clearly from the literature review and interviews, where the promotion of a coordinated approach to fair trade by EU actors and across EU policy areas is seen as a major advantage. An EU-coordinated approach can play a major role in promoting the fair trade agenda in two areas in particular, and these relate to labelling and public procurement. Both these areas require significant legal capacity and skills, together with detailed knowledge of the technicalities involved and the various international commitments that may apply. A common labelling regime, ",
        "6 previously put forward as an option for regulatory action on the European level 9 , remains an option to be further explored (see Policy recommendations, page 31). The final major recommendation relates to LRAs and what they can do. Taking into account the variable capacity, experience and interest, in order for LRAs to be able to support fair trade a whole range of national and EU policy measures have to be put in place. Committing themselves to these priorities, and devoting resources to building internal capacity, would be the best way forward. There are at the same time, a wide array of sensitive local issues that they would need to deal with in the process. Ranging from extensive existing obligations and limited resources, to a limited understanding of the wider benefits of fair trade, are just examples of the challenges they face. By and large, stronger clarity at the EU level can play a role in guiding and advising national and sub- national authorities of the advantages and difficulties involved in the process. The policy context at different levels: identifying policy instruments and modalities In the domestic policy context, governments traditionally adopt a multiplicity of approaches that have to operate within various national and EU-level rules and frameworks. These include: - Procurement policies - Tax and subsidy incentives - Credit and financing facilities - Marketing support - National labelling schemes - Product standards, etc. The use of one or more of these policy instruments in an appropriate combination so as to achieve cost-effective and pro-competitive solutions is complicated by the decentralised regulatory power in many countries. Aligning local endeavour in one part of the system with global trade rules, commercial structures, with the organisation of producer and processing markets in third countries, will be challenging. 9 Ibid. 2 at 123.

        "7 1. Existing framework to regulate fair trade 1.1 Recent developments in the EU-level framework One of the main reasons for this increased interest is that fair trade has continued to grow in the number of farmers and workers involved and the volumes of products sold on fair trade terms. 10 This tendency has also been paralleled by a general call for recognition of LRAs as central actors in development policy and for their widened engagement in the achievement of fair and balanced growth both across the EU and globally. In this regard, essential input has been provided by the Commission Communication on Local Authorities: Actors for Development 11 and the opinion of the CoR was adopted in April 2009. 12 The role of local and regional authorities as strategic partners in EU external policies has been widely discussed in light of increasing the effectiveness, coherence and accountability of the EU. The position of LRAs has further been recognised in communications by the European Commission, such as the recently published one Empowering Local Authorities in partner countries for enhanced governance and more effective development outcomes . 13 The communication reiterates the vast potential of the cooperation between European LRAs and developing countries as the means to strengthen decentralisation and local governance through inter alia peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing and transferring experience. With regard to fair trade and LRAs in particular, we look at the progress achieved since the previous opinion of the CoR. 14 The CoR\u2019s opinion called for 'a common European Fair Trade Strategy for Local and Regional Authorities to be drafted, accompanied by an action programme that fulfils environmental and social criteria, in order to support fair trade and environmental and social procurement.' 15 This has not been achieved, but the EC has addressed the other key recommendations, including attempts to clarify the legal context of sustainable public procurement. 10 Fairtrade International (2013).

        "8 For a decade the legal basis for public procurement in the EU was provided by Directives 2004/18/EC, until the new EU Public Procurement Directive was adopted in 2014. 16 The Directive represents the EU\u2019s guidance on how to include fair trade criteria in tenders, highlighting the role of LRAs in promoting the purchase of fair trade products, or other ecological, ethical or solidarity approaches. 17 In the new Directive, the general principles of procurement (Article 18) recognise the role of the Member States in 'taking appropriate measures to ensure that in the performance of public contracts economic operators comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions' 18 . In particular, the award criteria or contract performance conditions can 'relate to the supply or utilisation of fair trade products in the course of the performance of the contract to be awarded' which is in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU. 19 The adoption of the new Directive could be considered as an example of the consistent efforts of the EU to integrate social and environmental criteria into the procurement procedures. The admissibility of Fair Trade criteria \u2013 alongside other social considerations \u2013 in public procurement was already contemplated in Buying Social \u2013 A Guide to Taking Account of Social Considerations in Public Procurement 20 , issued by the Commission in 2011. The Commission published the Communication on Trade, growth and development in 2012, aiming 'to further facilitate fair and ethical purchasing choices by public authorities in Europe'. 21 In order to increase synergies between trade and development policies, the Commission states in the paper that the EU has to 'ensure that economic growth and development go hand in hand with social justice, including core labour standards, and sustainable environmental 16 Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.

There is more on DEAR below in the section 'supply side' (page 28). 24 1.2 National, regional and local approaches In comparison to the focus on public procurement at European level, and since the CoR\u2019s opinion on fair trade, local and regional administrations have increasingly been involved in the development and implementation of policies targeting fair trade and sustainability issues. Despite the progress made, wide differences persist across the EU. These can be grouped according to the level of involvement of the national, regional and local level in fair trade promotion; the scope of involvement across possible initiatives: public procurement, subsidies, awareness raising, educational activities, developing new partnerships and organising events; and the extent to which existing policies have been implemented and monitored. The approaches also differ in the dynamics between the multiple levels of governance, the evolution of the local economic systems and the extent of the actors involved in shaping and development initiatives. Finally, the approaches vary in the extent to which they are transferable to other places and timing, both in advanced and developing and emerging economies. Taking this into consideration, very different configurations exist where four groups have been defined as a result of the criteria identified in the section on approach and methodology (page 3): 22 Idem. 23 Idem. 24 DG International Cooperation and Development.

        "10 - High awareness raising and recognition: countries where fair trade policy and practice have high levels of recognition, both market-based and policy-oriented/ regulatory approaches \u2013 e.g. the UK, Germany, Belgium (especially Flanders), Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Ireland 25 ; - Medium to high awareness raising and recognition: countries where actors involved in fair trade are very engaged but policy and practice is still not mainstream \u2013 e.g. France, Italy, Spain; - Medium to low awareness raising and recognition: countries where fair trade activities are picking up speed after a slow start \u2013 e.g. Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia; - Low or no awareness raising and recognition: countries where fair trade is still under-recognised and practices both by grassroots and LRAs are underdeveloped \u2013 e.g. Bulgaria, Romania, Portugal, Latvia and Lithuania. In addition to this division, examples of existing approaches fall within the following broad groups: a top- down approach driven from the national level\u2019s explicit support for fair trade and sustainable development (e.g. France, Sweden); LRA-driven approaches where the regional and local authorities have taken the initiative for fair trade engagement (Belgium, Italy); grassroots driven approaches (UK) and lastly, mixed approaches (Germany, the Netherlands). The difficulty with this division lies in the allocation of the Central and Eastern Member States as well as some of the Southern countries to such classification. The reasons for this have been a very informal mode of development of fair trade activities across the national and sub-national levels and also the limited number of activities overall. 26 1.3 Low or no awareness raising and recognition (Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) Despite overall developments on the EU level, low or no awareness raising and recognition exists in a number of the EU Member States. Among those with low awareness raising, there is a further division: countries with reported sales of fair trade products and those with negligible sales of such products. In the former group fall Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania where fair trade product sales have been driven by 'Finnish FLO quality label organisations [...] which support start-up campaigns and issues licenses for the three countries'. 27 They are still in the process of building their own processes and organisational structures in support 25 See Annex 2 for the ranking of Fair Trade Towns per country. 26 Interviews 1 and 4. 27 CTB - Trade for Development Centre http://issuu.com/tradefordevelopmentcentre/docs/oost-europa_- _english_version, page 4.

        "11 of fair trade and there is little to report in terms of approaches, 'at present there are no local companies yet with labelled products on the market, just international retailers.' 28 Most recently, Hiiu District of Estonia became the first Fair Trade Town in the country on Thursday 23 October 2014 29 . The second group of slow movers, countries where fair trade is still under-recognised and practices both by grassroots and LRAs are underdeveloped, includes Bulgaria, Romania and to an extent Greece. Previous detailed studies of EU Member States also highlight the very slow pace of development of fair trade markets. 30 Some of the barriers are reviewed in subsequent chapters. There are very little data on fair trade markets and activities on a sub-national level. 1.4 Medium to low awareness raising and recognition (Poland and Czech Republic) In the group of those countries who are picking up speed in the development of fair trade activity, particularly in Poland, on the sub-national level this has been driven primarily by a 'community of enthusiastic people' or even individual initiatives. 31 The reasons for this type of formation process have been discussed previously from a historical perspective, highlighting the lack of freedom of associations and networks of non-governmental organisations as well as little history of grassroots creation during the Communist period. 32 In the past years the Czech Republic has been termed the 'island in Central and Eastern Europe' due to the fast pace of development of various initiatives, the achievement of Fair Trade Town status and the ongoing activities and partnerships. 33 Overall very little research has been done to date on the situation in Central and Eastern Europe with regard to local and regional authorities and even though there has been some progress with joint activities, they have not been documented in detail. 34 Further to the interviews conducted and the literature search, it could be seen that there is a link between the levels of fair trade and the overall development assistance a country provides to developing countries and commitment to 28 Idem. 29 7th International Fair Trade Towns Newsletter, 23 October 2014. http://www.fairtradetowns.org/news/7th- international-fair-trade-towns-newsletter/ 30 Ibid 2. 31 Interview 4. 32 Interview 4. 33 Interview 4 34 CTB - Trade for Development Centre http://issuu.com/tradefordevelopmentcentre/docs/oost-europa_- _english_version ",
        "12 development goals. 35 In Poland, the Czech Republic and to an extent in Romania, support for economic, social and environmental issues is enshrined in legislative and non-legislative documents on development cooperation, and if existing, strategic documents on sustainable development or the Europe 2020- inspired National Reform Programmes. This process goes hand-in-hand with the recognition of Poland and the Czech Republic as emerging donor countries by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) where development cooperation has emerged as a part of their foreign policies. 36 The Polish development cooperation agenda has been driven by a number of strategic documents, including Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2012 \u2013 2015 37 and National Reform Program Europe 2020 of Poland and especially the dimension on Corporate Social Responsibility 38 . Similarly the Czech Republic\u2019s policy is guided by the Development Cooperation Strategy 2010 \u2013 2017 , where the focus is placed on strengthening the systems of partner countries and increasing the capacity of their development participants so that they can play a more active role in formulating and implementing the development policies of their countries. To this end it established a system of cooperation with NGOs, including the provision of funding for development activities at both the level of individual NGOs and in the Czech Forum for Development Cooperation (FoRS). This tendency has been paralleled by further recognition of consumers of development issues as well as support for fair trade on the national and sub-national levels. Looking into more consolidated frameworks for support of fair trade, we examine a selection of countries: medium to high awareness raising and recognition (France, Italy) and high awareness raising and recognition (Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, the UK) which are discussed below and where we highlight some of their particularities and modalities of support. These countries have been selected to represent a range of fair trade organisational structures and regulatory experiences as well as geographical balance.

        "13 1.5 Medium to high awareness raising and recognition (France, Italy) 1.5.1 France Support for fair trade principles has been inscribed in the national French legislation and authorities showed wide engagement as early as 2005 when it became part of its Small Business legislation. 39 It can be seen that fair trade is now fully part of the national strategy for sustainable development, which is considered a binding commitment at national level. The recently amended Article 60 of the Law for SMEs (by article 94 of the law 2014-856) also highlights the importance of North-North trade. 40 The dominant paradigm of world trade patterns has two principal features. Trade between North and South is inter-industry and arises due to traditional comparative advantage, largely determined by differences in endowment patterns. North-North trade is defined as trade among the rich countries of the North and is mostly intra-industry. It is largely based on economies of scale and product differentiation. 41 A recent study on fair trade in Europe provides further background on this tendency for support of North-North trade and what it means for LRAs. 42 In 2013, the ministers in charge of development policy launched a National Action Plan for fair trade after a government-wide consultation with the aim to ensure coherence across issue areas such as trade, tourism, ecology, agriculture and development. The main goal of the Action Plan is to provide a boost to fair trade in France, substantially increasing the proportion of purchase of fair trade products in the basket of French consumers by setting precise targets: multiplying the number of producers in the South engaged in fair trade production and doubling, within five years, sector jobs in France; as well as ensuring that the Plan\u2019s implementation is regularly monitored. This plan also links to the recent French draft policy and programming Law on Development Policy and International Solidarity, which 'promotes the development of trade based on fair trade and contributes to the support of social and solidarity economy initiatives and microcredit in recipient countries'. 43 Also in 2014 the government initiated its second National Action Plan for Sustainable Public 39 Loi n\u00b0 2005-882 du 2 ao\u00fbt 2005 en faveur des petites et moyennes entreprises, Article 60, http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006052103&dateTexte=20100719 40 Loi n\u00b0 2014-856 du 31 juillet 2014 relative \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie sociale et solidaire, http://www.developpement- durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/loi_no_2014-856.pdf 41 Helpman, Elhanan (1981).

        "14 Procurement 2014-2020 (PNAAPD). 44 The plan aims to organise national actions for sustainable procurement and unite the different actors in charge of public procurement in State, local authorities and public hospitals. 45 In terms of practical application, the Plan relies on civil society representatives (e.g. La Plate-forme Fran\u00e7aise du Commerce Equitable (PFCE) ) as a key tool to support fair trade initiatives on the sub-national level, in particular: strengthen the attractiveness of fair trade; develop the competitiveness of fair trade companies by opening new markets and expanding existing ones; gather economic indicators on the fair trade markets; increase knowledge of the impact of fair trade and help with the forward thinking and activities of French players in Official Development Assistance 46 (ODA); as well as produce a practical educational guide for public and private purchases. 47 As previous studies have reported 48 , France was the first country to adopt a 'legislative and institutional framework exclusively devoted to fair trade.' 49 The Minister for Social and Solidarity Economy and Consumption continues formalising the exchange of good practices with several countries, North and South, within cooperation agreements and partnerships. These agreements contribute in particular to promoting fair trade and strengthening activities on a sub-national level. Fair trade on the level of LRAs is primarily driven by the Territoires de Commerce equitable , the French version of the international project Fairtrade Towns. The campaign team provides a framework for support to LRAs and citizens. LRA activity is also strengthened by their partnership with the French Agency for Development \u2013 AFD. AFD has signed about 30 partnership agreements with French local governments that have expressed strong interest in international aid. It has provided funding through trilateral agreements (each co- signed by AFD, a local government in France, and a partner municipality in a developing country). 50 44 France also ratified on 26 February 2014 the new EU directive on public procurement and plans to transpose the Directive within two years. 45 Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9cologie, du D\u00e9veloppement durable et de l'\u00c9nergie (2014), Plan national d'action pour les achats publics durables 2014-2020, Consultations publiques, June 2014, http://www.consultations- publiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/plan-national-d-action-pour-les-achats-publics-a512.html 46 The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as 'those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are: provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and each transaction of which: a) is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and b) is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent).' http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm#Definition 47 Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9cologie, du D\u00e9veloppement durable et de l'\u00c9nergie, 'Soutenir au plan institutionnel les acteurs et les principes du commerce \u00e9quitable', http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/05-11.pdf 48 See Brigitte and Dine, Janet (eds).

        "15 Another initiative which has to be observed and evaluated is the 'Local Fair Trade Charter', launched in June 2014 which sets fourteen principles aimed at developing fair trade relations in support of smallholder and agroecological agriculture in the French situation and context. 51 1.5.2 Italy Italy is characterised by regional-level legislation, which to a varying degree covers the modalities of fair trade support in the absence of a standard framework at national level. 52 The reason for selecting Italy is the fact that the proposed fair trade bill presents the most ambitious legislative initiative in the EU. As recently as November 2014, Italy has put forward a bill for Provisions for the regulation and promotion of fair trade 53 which aims to establish a regulatory framework and a legal status specific to a world in constant growth, quantitative and qualitative, such as that of fair trade. The draft law provides the background to the growth of fair trade in Italy, where the General Assembly of the Italian fair trade (AGICES) brings together 92 fair trade organisations, each of which produces multiple working and voluntary opportunities across sixteen Italian regions. In Italy the world shops continue to have a central role for both commercial and awareness raising activities. The law also provides a detailed overview on the dynamics on a regional level, with Tuscany being the pioneer in developing a fair trade law. In drafting regional laws to promote fair trade, the authorities have considered four key elements: 54 - the recognition of the social and cultural value of fair trade by the region; - the presence of the definition of a fair trade organisation; - support for organisations involved in the dissemination of fair trade products; - support to the practices of fair trade purchases of Local Authorities. According to the Italian national authorities themselves, the main feature of the Tuscany and Abruzzo texts in particular is 'the strong emphasis on the importance of the self-regulatory system which organizations of the sector have developed in recent years'. 55 At the same time, they highlight the need for incentives and enabling factors. 51 France has national 'local fair trade' charter. http://www.befair.be/en/content/france-has-national-local-fair- trade-charter 52 Interview 1. 53 Da Villa et al.

        "16 The specific objective of the proposed national-level framework is not to replace these activities but to provide: i) an official recognition of the role played by all those who participate in fair trade activities and establish precise definitions (Article 2); ii) give a guarantee to the public and especially to consumers about the transparency and fairness of the production processes and methods through a certification system to document the conformity of production processes (Article 6); iii) support and fund initiatives for fair trade products and organisations active in this area. The interventions which will be financed through the fund include: - different modes of facilitation and incentives for organisations investing in fair trade (Article 9); - promotion of public goods within the offices of fair trade (Article 10); - institution of a National Fair Trade Day (Article 11); - establishment of the Fund for Fair Trade (Article 14) 56 . Further examples from Italy include the recently adopted General regulations on international cooperation for development which highlight the principle of subsidiarity and the participation of fair trade organisations in international development. 57 1.6 High awareness raising and recognition (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK) 1.6.1 Germany Germany has a number of diverse configurations across LRAs. At the level of the Federal Government, the 2012 Progress Report of National Sustainable Development Strategy explicitly defines its support to fair trade, emp hasising sustainable and environmentally - friendly procurement and civil society. Under the aegis of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder express their sustainable procurement alliance by promising 'to consult with environmental and social standard systems, e.g. The Common Code sull'approvazione e l'applicazione di nuove leggi regionali e nazionali sul commercio equosolidale e gli acquisti pubblici solidali' 56 With a budget of 1 million Euros for the year 2015 based on the commitment to raise funds taken in the Assembly of the Chamber of Deputies from government pro tempore November 26, 2012, accepting the agenda no. 9/05 535-A / 007 (Duilio, Lulli). 57 Legge 11 agosto 2014 , n. 125, Disciplina generale sulla cooperazione internazionale per lo sviluppo, page 10, http://www.cooperazioneallosviluppo.esteri.it/pdgcs/Documentazione/NormativaItaliana/legge%2011%20agosto %202014%20n.%20125%20-.pdf ",
        "17 for the Coffee Community and Fairtrade . 58 The strategy\u2019s focus is on ways to stimulate demand, inviting 'the citizens of Germany to get involved in global development through an engagement campaign \u2013 by purchasing fair trade products, by volunteering in civil society organisations, by donating, campaigning and many other forms of active engagement'. 59 Well-known flagship projects that involve awareness raising events include the Fair Trade Action Week and The Capital of Fair Trade 60 . In terms of cooperation practices, the Fair Procurement Network, created in 2007, prompts sub-national authorities to buy fair trade products and waive goods that are produced by child labour or in violation of minimum social standards. 61 Other key actors assisting fair trade by LRAs include the Service Agency Communities in One World (SKEW) and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) . 62 The Service Agency Communities in One World (SKEW), a division of Engagement Global gGmbH 63 , supports local actors in realising sustainable, municipal development cooperation on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and supports the uptake of fair trade practices by municipalities. 64 SKEW is intended to assist the development of capabilities of municipal-level German actors within local authorities and non-governmental organisations in the fields of fair trade/fair procurement and global municipal twinning arrangements, but also migration and development. It has a broad structure which involves federal, state and local governments as well as NGOs. SKEW is also intended to make a contribution to realising the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 58 National Sustainable Development Strategy 2012 Progress Report, page 184. 59 Ibid at 209. 60 Organised by the Fair Trade Forum, the Fair Trade Action Week happens once per year and aims to increase consumers' awareness of fair trade issues and to encourage them to purchase regularly fairly traded products. Organised in every two years by Service Agency Communities in One World (SKEW), a body that supports local actors in realising sustainable, municipal development cooperation, the 'Capital of Fair Trade' is a competition which awards 'promotion of fair trade local activities, including city marketing campaigns, school projects and joint public-private activities. Recognition is also given to bodies that purchase fairly traded products, for example public authorities that serve fairly traded coffee and canteens in municipal institutions that use fair trade products.' Based on the municipal contributions submitted in 2009 to the campaign 'Capital of Fair Trade', The Service Agency Communities issued in November 2010 a practical guide on Fair Trade in municipalities. The guide is an information tool for city administration and civil society showing them actions of structural measures, information awareness, municipal procurement, fair city marketing, marketing and sales of fair trade products, and development education.

It supports local authorities in partner countries in the 'fields of democratisation and decentralisation and assists involvement of municipal projects and twinning arrangements in technical cooperation'. 65 Most recently, the German Section of Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) published a comprehensive report entitled 'Municipal Charter for the Future \u2013 One World \u2013 Our Responsibility, Sustainability at Municipal Level' 66 , which aims to contribute to the initiatives accompanying the European Year for Development 2015 by 'supporting decentralisation processes, participating in the establishment of autonomous local governments, and sharing with their colleagues from the South the lessons they have learned with municipal services.' 67 The importance of the Municipal Charter for the Future is in its provision of a comprehensive description of the tasks municipalities perform in the areas of sustainability, including fair trade. Acknowledging the variation of structures and resources across countries, the Charter clarifies the role of municipalities in global supply chains and thus can serve as an example for a EU-wide Charter. 1.6.2 The Netherlands The Netherlands has one of the oldest structures in place to support fair trade 68 . Over the past years, the Netherlands has undertaken a review of its development policy and created the post of Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to underline coherence between the two policy areas 69 . In light of this, one of the private sector instruments that it supports is the Sustainable Trade Initiative IDH 70 ( Initiatief Duurzame Handel ), started in 2008 as a 'multistakeholder initiative of private companies, NGOs, trade unions and the Dutch government with the aim of 65 Ibid 59 at 5. 66 This Municipal Charter is part of a joint initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development Charter for the Future which aims to unite the efforts of state, civil society, the scientific community, the business community, regions and municipalities in developing a joint contribution to the European Year for Development 2015. 67 Stated in introduction by Karl - Heinz Sch\u00e4fer, Mayor of Pohlheim and President of the German Section of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions in Council of European Municipalities and Regions/ German Section (2014), Municipal Charter for the Future.

It has developed into a key player in accelerating the use of Voluntary Sustainability Standards (like UTZ and Rainforest Alliance certified) and other efforts to improve the sustainability in supply chains for commodities from developing countries. 73 The initiative has been defined as 'modern business-like public/private cooperation' and is one of the key tools of the Dutch government to pursue an integrated agenda for aid, trade and investment. 74 In the assessment of the IDH, the evaluators follow a general theory of change leading to the idea that to drive the process of market transformation in supply chains, an initial level of public support is necessary to establish the standards and launch the training. From this assumption it follows that once a 'certain market share of sustainable produce is reached, other companies would follow, and less or no external support would be required'. 75 Therefore, public support through for example, subsidies and Official Development Aid can bridge the period between set-up investment and tangible benefits which would serve as an incentive to economic operators. This approach resonates with the infant industry theory and the decision of when an industry should be protected. 76 The possible role of government in establishing the long-term public-private partnership includes 'subsidising pilot programmes, convening frontrunner market players and NGOs, creating networks and exchanging knowledge of mainstream players, strengthening transparency and competition, to putting legislation in place'. 77 The IDH\u2019s Action Plan Sustainable Trade 2011-2015 has been defined as a 'public-private sustainability investment portfolio' supported by 70 private companies, CSOs, labour unions and trade associations, coordinated through IDH. 78 Other institutional partners include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 71 Government of the Netherlands (2014).

The development and implementation of IDH serves as a very good example of an innovative approach undertaken by the national authorities to enable developments on the sub-national level. Another interesting initiative from the Dutch government is a dedicated government agency supporting exports from small producers in developing countries, CBI. 81 Together with the Dutch Association of World Shops (DAWS) with funding from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CBI has established the Upscaling Gifts & Living products project. The project aims at improving European market access for producers of fair trade Gift & Living products. 'The target countries are six African countries \u2013 Egypt, Kenya, Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda \u2013 as well as Vietnam and Indonesia.' 82 Such initiatives provide an example which can be replicated at EU level in order to facilitate the EU market access of SMEs in developing countries. 1.6.3 Belgium In Belgium the system of multi-level governance gives independence to sub- national authorities to conduct policy making, which is clearly reflected in the policies implemented by the City of Ghent. 83 The formation of a common sustainable development strategy is essentially based on regional approaches as national level strategy does not exist. Belgian policy-makers are currently negotiating National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS). 84 Being a federal state, adopting a national strategy requires the coordination between the federal government, the regional and the community governments. The adoption of a NSDS would also be applicable to sub-national levels, which would incentivise stronger coherence between the different political levels. 85 On the regional level in Belgium, the Walloon and Flemish governments have actively promoted fair trade.

In terms of fair trade, the document highlights that the government 'intends to systematically favour in the canteens of regional governments, public interest organizations and other regional institutions, products from the Walloon agriculture, organic farming, local produce and seasonal and those of fair trade. To do this, a central market is implemented to encourage public authorities to favour, in terms of consumption of agricultural products, purchase of goods and services produced locally and sustainably'. 87 This commitment to sourcing ethical production and consumption also exists in two consecutive Regional Policy Statements: 2009- 2014 88 and 2014-2019 89 of Wallonia, where the government also reiterates support for North-North fair trade. The Flemish government takes the commitment to fair trade further by outlining a vision for the international dimension of its policy by 2050 to fully be based on the principle of a fair world. 90 Another stakeholder in support for fair trade activities by LRAs is the Trade for Development Centre (TDC) which is a programme of the Belgian Development Agency (BTC) programme. The Centre gives smallholders in the South the opportunity to develop in a sustainable way by supporting a range of fair trade-related initiatives. It is involved in awareness raising, disseminating and exchanging information, as well as organising the yearly 'Week of Fair Trade' in Belgium. 91 1.6.4 Denmark The Danish approach to fair trade support is primarily based on direct financial support (grants) and promotion of labelling.

Finally, under jointly the Strategic Framework for Priority Area Growth and Employment 2011-2015 and the Responsible Growth \u2013 Action Plan for Corporate Social Responsibility 2012-2015 , the Danish International Development Agency (Danida) contributed a total of DKK 1,5 million (EUR 201,500) to financially support the promotion of Fairtrade-labelled products by Fairtrade Mark Denmark (FMD) which serves as a bridging phase until application criteria and procedures for the new Corporate Social Responsibility & fair trade facility have been completed. The type of activities which are financed include: i. guidance and assistance to companies on product development and supply chain management and growing the assortment of fair trade products; ii. optimise the marketing of Fairtrade labelled products; as well as iii. raise awareness about development challenges and the Fairtrade labelling. 100 Grants from Danida have almost solely been used for activities motivating consumers and commercial actors by creating awareness about Fairtrade since FMD has a high degree of independent earning without external financing. The Fairtrade Mark Denmark: Bridging Phase can serve as an example for bridging finance to LRAs while they establish their own source of financing. 101 1.6.5 The United Kingdom Like the Netherlands, the UK has established structures and processes in support of fair trade without the existence of legislative background. Government support to the various sub-national levels has been substantial and has followed the product-certification route. 102 The United Kingdom is the country with the highest amount of Fairtrade Cities, formally recognised by the Fairtrade Foundation as a city where there is strong support for Fairtrade by local residents, businesses/organisations, schools, faith communities and community groups. According to the Fairtrade Foundation 2014 Factsheet, the UK is currently the biggest Fairtrade market in the world, with GBP 1.5 billion (EUR 2,02 billion) 99 Fairtrade City is part of the global Fairtrade Towns campaign see page 1.

Overall UK support to fair trade is largely linked to the way fair trade promotion has developed, particularly that it has been largely grassroots based. 104 It started through the initiatives of local residents and NGOs as well as consumers with a desire for ethically sourced products in general. In the UK, compared to other Member States, fair trade initiatives are largely driven by the grassroots and much progress has been made at town level. Currently, steps are taken to improve cooperation within counties. 105 UK Government policy, reflected in the Eliminating World Poverty: Building our common future . White Paper on International Development , highlights the association between fair trade and sustainable development by identifying the purchase of goods produced and traded as a tool that has the potential to contribute to international development efforts in a way that is sustainable over time. 106 The mode of support for fair trade focuses on start-up grants and procurement guidelines but also ethical procurement by public administration. In particular, in 2009, the UK Government announced that the Fairtrade Foundation \u2013 the organisation respon sible for licensing Fairtrade International\u2019s (FLO) Fairtrade certification mark in the UK \u2013 was to be supported with a grant of \u00a312 million (EUR 16,2 million). 107 Fairtrade Foundation, which organises Fairtrade Fortnight each year to raise awareness of the Fairtrade message, is defined as 'the face of UK fair trade'. 108 Central UK Government policy and procurement guidelines also recognise that 'constituent government institutions can contribute towards the fair trade movement through the procurement of fair trade goods'. 109 103 Fairtrade Fortnight 2014: Facts & Figures. http://foncho.fairtrade.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/FactsStats_20141.pdf. 104 Interview 2. 105 Interview 2. 106 Department for International Development (DFID) (2009), Eliminating World Poverty: Building our common future.

        "27 2. Sum - up on modalities of support Until now the study/analysis has provided some examples of enabling factors on the national and sub-national level. The summary table provided in Annex 1 gives an overview of which level of governance tackles fair trade practices through legislative and non-legislative documents and which are the responsible authorities. As seen in the first part of the note, the list is rather limited for most countries of Central and Eastern Europe, mostly due to the fact that organisational structures and practices associated with fair trade are in the process of development and there are wide discrepancies in the pace. From the more detailed overview of the other eight countries, we see that modalities of support take different configurations and they have also undergone changes over the past year to accommodate the changed nature of fair trade from a parallel to mainstream market and from labelling and certification to activities which target inter alia education and training, capacity building and network development. These include but are not limited to: - National policy which enables and stimulates partnerships among LRAs; - Procurement policies which target sustainable practices; - Funding instruments which reflect local and regional structures and capacity, in the form of subsidies or credit facilities; - Support and inclusion of LRAs as stakeholders in development cooperation; - Public awareness of ethical consumption; - Creating networks with other Member States. Based on previous research, we have seen that the extent to which the national level can create an enabling environment depends inter alia on institutional settings and the degree of centralisation in the country under review, experience in promoting local and regional development, effectiveness of local and regional administrative systems, distribution of competencies between national, regional and local levels and the intensity of relations between sub-national institutions & civil society 112 . The synopsis also highlights that political commitment and incentives on the national level can create an enabling environment for the 112 For more information on these factors, see: Boland, P (1999), 'Contested Multi-Level Governance: Merseyside and the European Structural Funds' European Planning Studies, vol 7(5), no. 5, pages 647-664.; Hooghe, Liesbet and Gary Marks (2003) 'Unraveling the Central State, But How?

        "28 development of more fair trade activities. This has taken various patterns where general strategies on sustainable development are combined with legislative initiatives as well as grants, platforms and awards. One of the modalities of support which has been present, especially in the latest efforts by Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, is the creation of multi- stakeholder initiatives of private companies, NGOs, trade unions and the local and regional authorities, with the aim of improving the sustainability of commodity production and trade in developing countries. The multi-stakeholder initiatives can take various forms and they often involve an initial contribution by the government in order to create a bridging phase until sufficient resources are collected for it to be self-sustainable. The involvement of diverse stakeholders ensures the alignment of interests, goals and behaviour of the main economic actors for the benefit of local economic development and ethical trade with developing countries. The examples of the countries reviewed also points to the advantages of combining supply and demand approaches as well as top-down and bottom-up approaches. With regard to the former, attention should be paid to those action plans which combine provisions encouraging the uptake of fair trade products by citizens, companies and public bodies and creating better conditions in developing countries, for instance through decentralised cooperation or by encouraging local companies to source more fair trade products. The combination of supply and demand is especially notable in the proposed Italian bill which goes a step further and defines all key methods of support to fair trade. Opportunities for fair trade support can also be recognised in the approaches where countries develop an experience-sharing platform on a national or regional level. These include Germany with the well-known Fair Trade Capital Award but also some of the specific regional initiatives such as the Saarbr\u00fccken and the QuattroPole Initiative. ",
        "29 3. Good practices Multiple good practices have been identified in support of fair trade, decentralised cooperation and innovative approaches to ethical trade. Below the note highlights some examples across the primary methods of support: awareness-raising, financing schemes (also mentioned for individual countries previously), public procurement as well as creating fora and networks for sharing experience. More cases showing practices and examples of local and regional authorities\u2019 initiatives in fair trade have been collected in parallel to the current study and have informed its conclusions. 3.1.1 The 'Fair Trade fair' by the city of Dortmund The City of Dortmund organises the tradeshow Fairtrade and Friends on an annual basis. In 2014, the show acted as a presentation platform for 128 exhibitors across sectors such as accessories, household goods, arts and crafts, food, sustainable tourism, recycling, among others. The show aims to promote awareness on manufacturing conditions and introduce consumers to \u2018new\u2019 FT products such as clothes, flowers, cosmetics, and wood. 113 3.1.2 South West England Cities, such as Bristol and Newcastle, in England are appointing fair trade officers to city councils tasked with supporting the implementation of fair trade policies and practices, and promoting fair trade in their community. In South West England, there is an annual conference of town to share ideas and challenges on issues, including fair trade. The Fair Trade Foundation is lobbying for regional fair trade coordinators to be appointed, to support organisation, activities, and awareness raising across sub-national authorities of England. 114 Wales was first fair trade nation and Scotland followed after declaring itself also fair trade Nation. 3.1.3 Hannover \u2013 Poznan Hannover in Germany is implementing several activities to encourage awareness and consumption of fair trade products in its community. On a national level Hannover is part of the Netzwerk Faire Beschaffung (Network for Fair Procurement) and participates at meetings of cities taking part in the biannual competition Hauptstadt fairer Handel (Fair Trade capital). At an international level, Hannover participates at Procura+ and occasionally takes part in 113 Fair and Friends, trade fair for fairtrade. http://www.westfalenhallen.de/messen/fair/en/. 114 Fair Trade Foundation, Annual Report 2013, Goal 2.

        "30 international Fair Trade Town meetings. As part of its fair trade activities, Hannover also supports its twin towns with the promotion of fair trade. In 2012/2013, the city held a meeting with representatives from Malawi, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the UK to raise awareness about the Millennium Development Goals, using Malawi as an example. The subject of fair trade as an instrument for sustainable development and reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been gaining ground in academic and policy-oriented literature as well as EU policy documents. 115 As seen earlier, the increased contribution of Central and Eastern European countries to development assistance and partnership with developing countries has increased awareness of the issues faced and to an extent increased support for sustainability initiatives, including fair trade. Particularly, the relationship between Hannover (Germany) and Poznan (Poland) provides an excellent example of innovative cooperation in the field. Hannover took the lead in an EU project called Aware&Fair and in this capacity provided guidance, education and volunteers for its twin town Poznan. In 2012, the city of Poznan was running a Fair Trade campaign as part of the Aware&Fair project and became the first Fairtrade Town in Poland in December of the same year. 3.1.4 QuattroPole QuattroPole is a trinational network of four cities: Luxembourg (LU), Metz (FR), Saarbr\u00fccken and Trier (DE). As the longest distance between any of the cities is an hour, the international alliance aims to encourage cooperation and collaboration across borders, and to implement innovative projects between the cities. All four cities were awarded the status of Fairtrade Town between the years of 2009 and 2012. Each city has appointed a working group, which works together with volunteer active clubs and initiatives, and their sister groups in the other cities to launch biannual fair trade events 116 . These groups are active in promoting citizen participation in these activities, and engaging local authorities and organisations in awareness raising for fair trade. QuattroPole is a unique cross-border alliance, which demonstrates the importance of collaboration in promoting and sustaining fair trade activities. 115 Dammert, Ana C. and Mohan, Sarah (2014).

        "31 4. Main barriers Turning to the factors that deter the development of fair trade, the interviews are very informative about the barriers which persist on the level of LRAs, national level and the treatment of fair trade in general. In the UK, for example, where a substantial number of fair trade-certified towns already exist, the difficulty is to coordinate across fair trade towns in order to achieve wider fair trade region status. 117 This difficulty has also been reiterated for France and Germany. The challenge in this case lies in the variation of involvement across towns and existing platforms for cooperation among local authorities. Currently the exchange of fair trade experiences and shared practices varies substantially between and within countries. Often the existing forums are driven by the activities of the Fair Trade Towns campaign and the International Fair Trade Towns conference. In light of this, the role of Fair Trade actors is to facilitate the spread of the best practices which happen on the ground with a primary focus on regionalisation. A number of suggestions have been put forward for possible platforms to incentivise this transfer between and across countries, as well as lessons from less successful attempts. This leads to a second challenge highlighted by interviewees \u2013 limited capacity at the local and regional levels. On one hand, there is an overall lack of personnel in the smaller authorities and when fair trade activities are undertaken in parallel to key activities, the resources that could be allocated for support to fair trade are limited. In the cases where such capacity exists and especially in the cases when volunteers are available to support fair trade promotion, there is limited knowledge on fair trade within the authorities and lack of guidance on how to run associated tasks. Examples for this barrier are ample from the experience of Poland, Czech Republic and Bulgaria, but also the UK, where delivering capacity building support to individuals and groups of LRAs has been seen as a priority. 118 On a general level the other complications that have been identified to slow down LRAs\u2019 involveme nt in fair trade range from: i) existing historical background in Central and Eastern Europe (see below); ii) lack of data and quality and comparability of data with regard to operating organisations; iii) lack of a clear position / message on the part of some national governments and EU institutions; as well as iv) a perception that support for fair trade can be perceived as interference in the market. 117 Interview 1 and 2. 118 Interview 2. ",
        "32 This is further reviewed below in the demand-associated challenges. One of the explanations put forward is the fact that Central and Eastern European countries which have little or no historical background of colonial relations with the developing countries do not feel as responsible for stimulating development. 119 The increasing number of legislative and non-legislative documents adopted by the countries in CEE is counteracting this status quo. Another challenge which has developed through historical reasons is the process through which grassroots initiatives and NGOs are formed in the former Soviet Union and Communist-led countries. Due to restrictions on the freedom of association, existing non-governmental organisations have been created to oppose authorities rather than to support a specific cause especially related to sustainable development. 120 Additional barriers to support for fair trade have been put forward by almost all interviewees. 121 Both LRAs and fair trade associations and foundations perceive the need for a clear message on the part of some national governments as well as EU institutions that fair trade promotion, production and consumption is not a parallel activity. It can and should be part of the regular activities of the authorities and it can contribute to local and regional economic development. This links to the deterring factors highlighted in the introduction that a common message of support for fair trade is essential, in addition to linking it explicitly to sustainable development. At the same time, such support for fair trade as the means to economic development highlights the key challenge to developing an EU-wide framework: needing concrete data on the impact of fair trade on the EU regions and developing countries (see Policy recommendations). Below we briefly outline the concerns indicated vis-\u00e0-vis supply and demand-side barriers. 4.1 Supply side On the supply side, the main barrier identified has been the availability and range of existing commodities that are fairly traded. This remains a challenge not only in Central and Eastern Europe, where there are few/no products that are certified domestically, but also in fair trade leaders. 122 This is especially important for public procurement. When LRAs decide to adhere to ethically traded commodities, it has sometimes been the case that no suppliers providing 119 Idem. 120 Interview 4. 121 Interviews 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. 122 Interviews 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. ",
        "33 such alternatives exist. Even when public procurement rules are updated to cover products which are sourced in a socially- and environmentally-friendly way, the major problem is the existence of trade across some of the commodities. This could be targeted by improvements in the supply chain, data exchange on the supply and demand of products and better networks among LRAs, which have been reviewed in the recommendations. A second barrier which has been highlighted is the lack of resources by local and regional authorities, especially intensified in some of the poorest regions of the EU. Research shows that most of the starting and bridging phase financial resources for fair trade support have been funded by EU projects. As in the previous case, this is intensified for LRAs in Central and Eastern Europe. For example, the interviewee from the Fair Trade Association in Poland underlined that there has been a shift in EC rules for tenders for grants towards a preference for larger-scale, cross-country projects. 123 This tendency has led to cutting out many small-scale projects as well as to the need for greater capacity for the organisations to be able to lead large ones. As a result, access to resources for smaller organisations has become more difficult. On one hand, this has stimulated the identification and creation of partnerships, but on the other hand it has dis-incentivised smaller scale initiatives. This stimulates partnerships but according to stakeholders, these take years to build and require capacity. 124 One good recent example for EU support includes the Development Education and Awareness Raising (DEAR) channelled through the thematic programme Non- State Actors and Local Authorities in Development (the NSA-LA programme). This programme, based on Article 14 of the Development Cooperation Instrument , aims to co-finance initiatives proposed or carried out by civil society organisations and local authorities. 125 A number of initiatives organised around the call for proposals, such as the 4th Partnership Fair on DEAR by Trialog, have facilitated partnerships, cooperation, learning and exchange at an international level for joint projects. 126 The Trialog organised Partnership Fairs have also been funded by the EC as well as the Austrian Development Fund. Another example of pooling resources across the region has been the project 'From overconsumption to solidarity' implemented by the Polish Fair Trade Association, along with partners from Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, funded by the Visegrad Fund and the EC. The goal of the project is, on one hand, to raise awareness on the global effects of over-consumption of natural resources in Europe; and on the other hand, to stimulate reflection and critical thinking by citizens in the countries of the Visegrad Group on the impact 123 Interview 4. 124 Idem. 125 Development education and awareness raising \u2013 funding. 126 TRIALOG (2013). 4th Partnership Fair on Development Education/Awareness Raising (DEAR), http://ocud.es/sites/default/files/PF2013_Description.pdf.

        "34 of excessive consumption of goods in Europe on socio-economic development in the Amazon region. 127 4.2 Demand side With regard to public procurement by LRAs, rules and their implementation remain a major barrier on the sub-national level in particular and once again with heightened effects on countries where fair trade organisational structures and processes are currently picking up. 128 The lag of the implementation of the EU Directive in public procurement is often due to limited capacity of the LRAs and this could be addressed with additional practical guidance (see Policy recommendations). Clear and uniform procurement assistance will also be essential in limiting the perception that procuring fair trade products leads to increased costs for the LRAs. 129 Finally, a barrier to uptake of fair trade public procurement can be found in the low level or lack of engagement of local authorities as well as political differences among stakeholders on a local, regional and national level. 130 The main barrier to increased consumption of fair trade products is low recognition or interest from the consumers. 131 While sales of ethically produced, fair trade products in the UK have increased substantially over the past years, there is a lot less consumer uptake in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The latest Eurobarometer reports that respondents, especially those in 'northern and western Member States are generally more likely to be prepared to pay more for products from developing countries'. 132 Overall at the EU level, the survey shows few shift in the opinion of European citizens, with the exception of Cyprus, Austria and Croatia where significantly more respondents are ready to pay more for groceries from developing countries. 133 According to other public opinion research, in Romania, for example, there is a very low consumer interest in fair trade products 'due mainly to the lack of information'. 134 Fair trade products have been 'perceived more as exotic objects, 127 'From overconsumption to solidarity', http://vedegylet.hu/o2s/index_en.php?page=info. 128 Interview 1, 4. 129 Interview 2. 130 Interview 2, 4. 131 Interview 1. 132 European Commission (2015).

A practical way to address this is a clearer presentation of fair trade items, their production and impacts on developing countries. As identified in one of the interviewee responses, there is a need for 'better connection of products with their producers, more particularly the way they have been produced \u2013 better marking of products i.e. nobody will buy a product labelled 'made by children'. 137 Two additional concerns link to the recognition and interest of consumers, namely that fair trade products are seen as an NGO initiative and related to particular brands and that fair trade products are limited in overall supply. These concerns are not surprising giving the low level of fair trade promotion and awareness-raising activities. The interviews clearly highlight the benefit of more joint activities and 'EU projects [which] work as ice-breakers and initiation for Central and Eastern European towns that can work together with more advanced western EU countries.' 138 Below we outline some additional recommendations to address this. http://incomemagazine.ro/articole/miscarea-fair-trade-se-simte-si-in-romania. 135 Idem. 136 Interview 4. 137 Interview 5. 138 Interview 5.

        "37 5. Policy recommendations It is clear from the foregoing that the combination of policies, directives, framework structures, incentives, and local-level initiatives represents a formidable and ambitious set of goals, however loosely defined. At the same time, the drive for policy coherence across the economic and development spectrum to embrace the objectives of fair trade, sustainable development, ethical considerations and international development has to be recognised as a vast undertaking. We then need to consider the current economic policy context across the EU. Budgets are being held down, with much of the burden for adjustment falling on regional and local authorities, while individuals and companies are reducing their debt burdens, consolidating and scaling back. To be sure, as pointed out earlier, this represents an opportunity to realign domestic and external policies to deliver on the coherence agenda. One of the issues that needs to be considered in this context, therefore, is whether LRAs are in a position to significantly scale up their fair trade programmes in the current situation. In structuring our policy recommendations, we have given primacy to the importance of EU institutions. They will need to orchestrate the process, even if funding decisions are left to national governments and operational decisions are left to LRAs. By orchestration, we mean essentially shaping the way in which the system develops along the lines of coherence identified in the various initiatives. This is easier said than done, because of the interconnectedness and interdependence of issues. This creates a circular dynamic that could be mutually reinforcing, if well designed, or mutually destructive if not. For example, information and data is critical to good policy-making, but in the situation that currently prevails, is patchy, inconsistent across regions and systems, and not always available on time. Implementing strategies in this context is difficult at best and could be counterproductive at worst. Yet, to create effective information systems is expensive and time consuming, and cannot be justified unless the long term benefits outweigh the costs, and unless the resulting model succeeds in its major objectives. Everything therefore depends \u2013 if a Europe wide agenda is to develop \u2013 on the scale of commitment and ambition on display at the European level. It is for this reason that the study begins with recommendations relating to the top of the pyramid. ",
        "38 5.1 EU-level policy recommendations 5.1.1 Clarity on the level of ambition Essential for the design of an effective fair trade, ethical and sustainable agenda, and to determine the policy ecosystem within which it will ultimately operate. - More so when we consider that the level of ambition in applying fair trade principles has not been clearly identified in terms of how far it will eventually extend across the system in terms of product areas covered and geographic spread, and how far it will extend down the parallel routes of sustainability and ethical practices. The level of ambition will thus determine the extent to which concepts and objectives would need to be clarified and defined. This is especially relevant in terms of setting up a potential common labelling regime. According to previous studies, such regimes can take different forms: i) voluntary versus compulsory; ii) replacing existing national and private labels versus working alongside other schemes; and iii) minimum standards versus more ambitious criteria. 139 - With clarity on this issue in place, it would then be possible to place piecemeal objectives, such as the public procurement directive, or labelling or certification procedures for particular products, into context and to position them as milestones on a much longer road map. - Why we are doing all this would also become clearer to EU citizens, who could then identify with the broader social, environmental and economic model and their place in it. Currently, the approach appears fragmented and to some extent disjointed, and to that extent difficult to follow. Generating acceptance for this overall idea would constitute part of the process of defining the level of ambition. 5.1.2 Making the economic and business case From the literature review and from some of the interviews, it appears that the economic and business case in favour of an ambitious fair trade agenda is insufficiently developed. - The foremost challenge will come from those who would question the economic logic of this whole policy endeavour, particularly in a time of austerity, high unemployment and debt reduction. It could also come from established businesses \u2013 both within the EU and beyond \u2013 that cannot manage the transition or do not agree with the model. 139 Ibid. 2 at 177. ",
        "39 - Fortunately there is an existing set of analytical tools that can be used to explore this issue in considerable detail. In brief, we need to establish that it is possible to pursue a fair trade, sustainability and ethical agenda without compromising on costs, quality or competitiveness, while being assured of the reliability and durability of the system. - We would then need to assess this across product categories and with specific reference to markets and their structures. The employment dimension will be an important part of this analysis, both in terms of effects within European markets and with reference to emerging economies. - Although there will almost certainly be short- to medium-term adjustments to be considered, the way that the EU coordinates the design of a policy ecosystem (or universe), and the way it is actually implemented through a decentralised network of LRAs, could ensure a long-term outcome that is positive in economic, social, environmental and political terms. More so when one considers the stabilising effects of fair trade (and market access) policies on emerging economies on Europe\u2019s southern and eastern periphery, and on migration and poverty more generally. 5.1.3 Improving policy coherence As part of the process of clarifying the level of ambition that the EU is aiming for more generally, a number of interrelated policies need to be accommodated in this design. Amongst the more prominent, when considering the complex mix of issues involved in the fair trade, ethical and sustainability agenda, are the following: - External action - Trade policy - Sustainable consumption and production policies - Climate action policies - Common Agricultural Policy - Development strategies and commitments, especially related to the post- 2015 development agenda 5.1.4 Reconciling regulatory and policy priorities Coherence in approach is emphasised in the various policy endeavours covered in this study. However, greater attention needs to be given to reconciling this idea of coherence, which after all hopes to harness fair trade, sustainability, ethical practices and external policies to a common purpose, to areas of possible ",
        "40 policy inconsistency, or friction. Broadly speaking, possible inconsistencies can be found in the following areas: - WTO rules, particularly with respect to the principle of National Treatment, market access commitments, and for labelling and product standards and process requirements. - Competition policy rules of the EU and member states, and their international implications. - Investment rules (an issue that will become more important if and when the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is agreed with the US. In this situation, it may be necessary to negotiate an LRA exemption from TTIP commitments on investment). There could well be other issues that have not been flagged here. As a policy recommendation, this study would suggest a systematic evaluation of where these possible points of friction lie, and how the fair trade agenda, as it expands and becomes more entrenched, can be reconciled with their provisions. In terms of trade agreements \u2013 whether multilateral, bilateral or regional \u2013 whatever fair trade policy model is adopted by the EU, would require reciprocal recognition and would need to be accommodated within the structure of any such agreement, as with TTIP mentioned above. Developing the capacity to negotiate trade agreements that recognises a supportive policy environment (with reference to development, sustainability or any other agreed consideration) would be important in the broader scheme of things if friction during implementation is to be minimised. A more or less permanent mechanism, or advisory service, would also need to be in place to help LRAs and national governments identify problems and find solutions. Here again, we need to acknowledge that this could be quite an expensive service, particularly if a permanent advisory mechanism is to be established which is capable of responding quickly to queries and/or to providing research or legal advice and support. 5.1.5 A gap analysis of the policy structure If the EU is to support an enabling environment for the spread of fair trade practices through LRAs and beyond, identifying where and how the system can be shored up would be an important contribution. Perhaps the issue of funding and financing could be considered in this context. One possibility, for example, is if part of the external/foreign aid budget could be used to support LRAs in organising their fair trade strategies, providing some relief for LRA budgets. Looking beyond this, perhaps there is a way of using the funding of development banks (domestically, the EBRD, and internationally the World ",
        "41 Bank or regional development banks) to support some parts of the programme. From the material reviewed in this study, this area does not appear to be a major concern at the moment, so it is really just flagged as something to be considered when designing a complete ecosystem. 5.1.6 Monitoring, information and data flows From the literature reviewed and the other material evaluated during this study, it is clear that the lack of information and data is a fundamental weakness that needs to be addressed as a priority. Monitoring is also impossible without adequate or appropriate information flows. Not only is it impossible to compare models across countries, or even within countries (especially for \u2018bottom - up\u2019 systems), it is difficult to make an economic or business case, or to evaluate options in the absence of comparable or usable data. It is equally difficult to try and establish best practice across systems when the criteria and information differ substantially. As a consequence, the contribution that experience and operational practice in different parts of the system can make to learning about what works and what does not, is possibly lost. This in turn impedes the \u2018spread effect\u2019 of good examples, but equally means that mistakes can be repeated. An example can be seen in the almost complete absence of information on the ground effects of fair trade practices (of whichever type) on income levels of farmers in developing countries, or indeed on any other aspect of its wider impact. Answering this question is surely central to the debate on whether fair trade works or not. The same is largely true of environmental monitoring. Information and data, together with effective monitoring mechanisms, can thus provide the key inputs for every other phase of the policy and operational agenda. From formulating strategies, through evaluating options to making a strong economic and business case, all of these would depend on information flows. It would also be central to any strategy that seeks to promote experience- sharing, awareness raising, or policy advocacy. Equally, an effective and efficient system of monitoring and data collection would help create comparative tables, or indicators, on performance levels that would in turn support the efforts of LRAs to learn from one another. Incentives through the use of awards or some form of recognition could form part of this arrangement. This study would therefore highlight the importance of creating an effective data collection and management system that would feed the evaluation, monitoring and policy making process. Although this could be expensive, it would be entirely justified under the circumstances, and would have a significant multiplier effect on the overall effectiveness of the fair trade agenda. ",
        "42 5.2 National-level recommendations Many of the issues mentioned in the section above would equally apply to national-level responsibilities, but are perhaps more cost effective if coordinated at the EU level. What is striking from the results of this study is how differentiated and fragmented is the range of practices within the European system. Much of this is due to the way in which individual countries have developed their economic models, with bottom-up and top-down approaches followed in different places in different ways and following different trajectories. In this situation, the broad approach of this study is to recommend that the EU create the frameworks (policies, monitoring, coherence), and define the principles and scale of ambition, while national governments would provide the resources, support, and policy guidance and advice. The study recognises that while cross-border lessons can and should be learned, the first step for LRAs is to learn from each other from within their systems. There are cultural and political reasons for this and, if properly managed, they can be a considerable strength. For national governments that have limited or insufficient capacity (either at the national or LRA levels), the challenges are somewhat different. They not only need to create consumer awareness and the policy climate for a successful fair trade strategy, but have to encourage local businesses, together with importers and exporters, to work within this framework. Demonstrating the clear benefits of fair trade, environmental sustainability and ethical considerations becomes central to the process, but can be expensive. In these circumstances, a great deal of groundwork and experience sharing would be needed, and the benefit of EU institutions\u2019 involvement to support the process is evident. National governments therefore have a significant potential role in awareness raising, experience-sharing and providing policy and operational advice. Ideally, they should also back this with financial support, or through other allowable incentives or subsidies. There is considerable flexibility in the rules of the EU and the WTO that allow for this (subject to some conditions) particularly if the support is part of a sustainability (social, environmental or commercial), regional or development agenda. In particular we can expect them to act in the following areas: ",
        "43 - Policy dissemination and a business dialogue: to advise LRAs and other regions or cities of the possibilities that exist in this area in terms of business opportunities (either as consumers or producers), consumer benefits, etc. Also, to advise business of what is going on and of how this could alter market strategies. If the fair trade agenda is to become mainstream policy, then the dissemination of the implications of this approach would need to be coordinated through national governments. - Consultations : the transition to a fair-trade centred economic model requires careful handling. Consultation mechanisms provide governments with ideas about how best to do this, ideas about the complementarity between top-down and bottom-up approaches, and ideas about LRAs working together in managing contracts. Consultation procedures also help to build a consensus within society and to minimise tensions. - Sharing best practice : regions learn from each other much more readily than from national governments. Sharing across regions (initially within one country, but then more broadly) would make sense, and would be easier to organise. National governments would therefore have an interest in collecting data, monitoring and evaluating performance in this area. - Advice and guidance : relating to the working of the procurement rules and how these can be best managed, particularly with reference to applying green, social or ethical standards. National governments and LRAs would be the first to admit that public procurement strategies can be better and more efficiently managed. - Consumer awareness and public education : consumers respond best to messages that are couched in their own languages and which contain cultural and social references that are locally understood. Building consumer sentiment and attitudes is thus best left to local, regional and national governments. - Providing assistance : national governments are well aware of what can be provided within state aid, WTO and competition rules, whether in terms of grants and subsidies, or in terms of tax concessions or research support. - Adjustment assistance : the application of fair trade rules \u2013 as with environmental and ethical standards \u2013 can entail significant adjustment costs which national governments can meet through a variety of methods (tax concessions, subsidies, etc.). National governments are in the best ",
        "44 position to assess these and to design adjustment programmes that address local and regional needs. - Capacity building : in the current economic context, most LRAs are struggling to meet existing obligations without assuming new costs for an ambitious fair trade agenda. National governments can assist LRAs develop the institutional and organisational capacity that help deliver a pro-competitive fair trade model that is ethical, sustainable and equitable. This is an ideal long-term outcome that national governments would be interested in achieving. - Research support : national governments often have significant research budgets and facilities, many of which are looking at environmental and sustainability issues. These can be harnessed, too. 5.3 LRA level recommendations Taking into account the variable capacity, experience and interest, in order for LRAs to be able to support fair trade a whole range of national and EU policy measures have to be put in place. Some of the options have been outlined above and the role of LRAs is to take advantage of the policy framework created either at the national or EU level, and create operating conditions that effectively exploit these opportunities and make the most use of public procurement provisions, etc. At one level, LRAs need to use their limited \u2013 and in some cases declining \u2013 resources to promote development and economic regeneration while managing their e xisting responsibilities. If the EU\u2019s strategy to place fair trade (plus environmental and ethical concerns) at the heart of the development process is to be addressed, then a number of associated issues need to be dealt with. As a first step, this study would therefore recommend that LRAs be advised \u2013 if they have not already done so \u2013 to adapt their structures, systems and organisational methods to take full advantage of the opportunities in this area. The possibilities created by the procurement directives would perhaps be a good starting point. This would involve, for example, some of the following: - Establishing the right systems to take advantage of the evolving EU and national policy frameworks being developed around the fair trade agenda; ",
        "45 - Clarifying criteria for qualifying for certain labels and promoting transparency in sharing information regarding criteria; - Monitoring labelling initiatives; - Learning from other LRAs on what works and what does not; - Developing the skills and competencies needed, particularly in the public procurement process, to ensure that they achieve value for money; - Developing the monitoring and evaluation structures needed to assess performance and to form a platform for further adjustments to their strategies; - Promoting consumer awareness within society, institutions and business, to support the demand side of the equation; - Maintaining and promoting consumer confidence in fair trade labels; - Identifying the skills and professional requirements for the expanding job opportunities that will arise; - Supporting infrastructure development \u2013 social and physical \u2013 that will support the achievement of policy objectives. This is obviously only an indicative and illustrative list. Many LRAs will already be far advanced down this road, and could easily help others. 5.4 Changing the narrative The main recommendation links to the current treatment and presentation of fair trade. Even though research confirmed that fair trade is an 'essentially voluntary, dynamic mechanism that develops along with societal and consumer awareness and demands' 140 , both desk research and interviews highlight the changing nature of fair trade and the need to parallel these developments by also altering current discourse on the topic. In light of the economic and financial crisis, local and regional authorities throughout Europe are still facing trade-offs between various activities due to limited budgets. Particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, allocation of resources to supporting fair trade has not been prioritised. The existing practices clearly show that some LRAs have extended their approach beyond awareness raising and the labelling initiative and have taken steps to integrate fair trade principles across all sectors and activities. This highlights the added value of linking fair trade principles to jobs and growth agenda and in particular, in the key drivers of local and regional economic performance. In reshaping the concept of fair trade and the nature of the fair trade debate, the question to be addressed is how local and regional economic 140 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee - Contributing to Sustainable Development: The role of Fair Trade and non-governmental trade-related sustainability assurance schemes, COM(2009) 215 final. ",
        "46 development can boost economic activity and alleviate poverty in the EU, their territory and partner countries. In order to achieve this, one has to look at the micro dimension of local economic development, such as the drivers and causes of the behaviour of the key economic actors. In the case of fair trade promotion, these include local companies, international organisations, universities and other educational institutions, industrial associations, NGOs and government agencies both in the EU and in the exporting country. Globalisation but also the economic crisis has challenged some of the pre-existing dynamics and any reference framework should look into the policy options from these different perspectives. Possible proposal for action is to integrate fair trade standards and principles in local development strategies, in order to remain sensitive to territorial and local specificities. 5.5 EU-wide data collection and indicators In the medium to long term, the EU Member States would benefit from more tangible evaluation of the impact of fair trade. This would provide the necessary information to bring forward the advantages of the different approaches to fair trade as well as highlight the benefits to LRAs. Such an evaluation will have to be based on an extensive data collection exercise throughout Europe and partner countries. The indicators will inter alia cover economic data on the size of the fair trade markets such as the number of companies involved in fair trade, the number of jobs, the number of channels and affected producers. The development, collection and monitoring of fair trade indicators in addition to key sustainability ones will provide the basis for inter-regional comparison across several dimensions: - Fair trade track record \u2013 lead indicators: number of Fair Trade Towns and regions; number of fair trade organisations in the public register; presence of subsidies; - Awareness-raising \u2013 lead indicator: number of campaigns; promotion of educational activities; - Procurement \u2013 lead indicators: companies involved in fair trade; number of producers and number of importers; number of products; - Compliance with standards \u2013 lead indicators: comp liance with ILO\u2019s DWA and CLS; - Economic, social and environmental cohesion \u2013 lead indicators: Europe 2020 indicators.

        "Belgium - Aalst - Population: 83,347 During several work visits in the South African town of Worcester \u2013 to which the municipality of Aalst (Flanders, Belgium) is twinned since 2012 \u2013 Aalst became acquainted with Fairhills, the largest fair trade wine project in the world which currently helps support over 2 000 people in South Africa, Chile and Argentina. Fairhills in South Africa In 2005 Origin Wine and the employees of the Du Toitskloof Cooperative established the internationally accredited Fairhills Fairtrade project in Rawsonville. The aim of the Fairhills Association is to create revenue through their wine brands, which will enable them to uplift the people within the community by improving their skills. The revue generated through wine sales enables not only to develop new occupational opportunities for the community, but also to improve basic living conditions and provide cost efficient medical services to the Fairhills Community. One of the first benefits was the building of day-care facilities on the farms for the children in the neighbourhood. Before many farm workers were forced to bring their children with them to the vineyards, an unsafe environment for infants. Today, more than 200 small children are left at the day-care facilities where they are looked after by trained child nurses, most of whom used to work at the vineyards. A new primary school Fairhills Lorraine was later built, comprised of a library and computer centre as well as a new community hall in which a large variety of activities are being organised, including literacy courses for adults. Fairhills stimulates its workers to move on to a better, more educated job (within or outside the company) so that they can offer training to newly hired workers. A health care facility was recently implemented to provide free health care for workers and their families. A mobile health clinic offers first aid to injured workers at the vineyards. Through tree planting, the construction of wastewater treatment plants and the reuse of recycled water for irrigation purposes, Fairhills also contributes to a better environment. Aalst Fair Trade City The board of mayors and aldermen of the municipality of Aalst responded to the national campaign of a group of organisations such as Max Havelaar, Oxfam and Vredeseilanden in 2004 to raise more awareness about fair trade and sustainability in Aalst\u2019s Fair Trade Support Measures -fair trade wine Fairhills -fair trade lunch at the city museum -Week of the Fair Trade 65 ",

Aalst supports Fairhills The city of Aalst has offered its full support to the Fairhills project, not only by exclusively serving Fairhills wines at municipal receptions, but also by creating several activities in order to acquaint its own employees and the citizens of Aalst with the project. Each year, the municipality together with the Advisory Committee for International Cooperation organizes a one day world festival, \u201c Casa Del Mundo \u201d . Fairtrade is one of the features to which the municipality wishes to focus on during the festival and Fairhills is used as a concrete example to illustrate the benefits of fair trade. The European and International cooperation department of the municipality have so far organized two workshops for two different target groups, the hotel and catering industry on the one hand and the business managers on the other hand. The aim of these workshops was to convince the managers to add the Fairhills wines to their wine list and/or take the Fairhills wines into consideration as a corporate gift. Due to these initiatives, the city of Aalst renewed its title o f \u201cFair Trade City\u201d in 2014 and 2015. 66 ",

This initiative came about 15 years ago in order to raise awareness and apprise Catalan citizens about the conditions of international trade and its consequences in Southern countries. The aim is to promote Fair Trade and Ethical Banking and, thus, to encourage people to integrate these practices in their everyday lives. The activities carried out during this event are clearly targeted to raise awareness: theatre, musical shows, and performances for children, games, exhibitions, documentary film screening and selling of Fair Trade products, among others. Barcelona Provincial Council (Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona) supports this initiative by funding the event and spreading the information to all the cities of the Province. Since 2003, the Fair Trade Celebration has taken place not only in Barcelona, but also in other cities of Catalonia (nowadays up to 30 municipalities and 90 neighbourhoods), with the participation of more than 200 organisations. The celebration takes place on the 10 th of May to commemorate the World Fair Trade Day, celebrated in more than 800 cities across the globe. In line with the event, a broad communication campaign is launched: press conferences, advertisement spots, the Event Journal offered with El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya, promotional banners, posters, communication plans for social networks and its website (www.festacj.org). Throughout the Fair Trade and Ethical Banking Celebration, people see fair trade and solidarity-based economy as alternatives to commercial and economic practices that generate speculation and poverty all over the world. Thousands of worldwide experiences prove that a more fair, democratic and sustainable trade and economy are possible, together with the promotion of values such as equity, justice, cooperation, participation and environment protection. Everyone can take part in these initiatives just by small actions in their daily lives and contribute to improve the situation in developing countries through a more responsible consumption.

        "Germany - Bremen - Population: 548,914 Fair Trade is one of the main pillars of Bremen\u00b4s Development Cooperation strategy. Consequently, Bremen was among the first German L\u00e4nder to introduce a law containing the commitment towards social and ecological standards in public procurement. Furthermore, we sponsor projects and initiatives which dedicate themselves to Fair Trade and its promotion. As a city we are involved in those activities and also try to set a good example by using Fair Trade products during events and in public facilities, not only in our prestigious town hall. Thanks to our various partners within the city, our efforts have already been recognized twice. We were first awarded as Germany\u00b4s \u201cFair Trade Capital 2011\u201d by the German state agency \u201c The Service Agency Communities in One World \u201c and secondly by several NGO\u2019s as \u201cFair Trade Town\u201d together with our sister city Bremerhaven in 2014. Especially the jury from the Fair Trade Capital Award was impressed by the various different stakeholders involved throughout the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen as well as the number of creative projects that exist and are being promoted. The capital award has both been a boost to our activities and an appreciation for the people in our city dedicating themselves towards Fair Trade. The priz e money of \u20ac 30.000 has been used to fund further initiatives and projects and strengthen public awareness both locally and as a part of our tourism marketing. Furthermore, various companies and retailers specializing in Fair Trade goods have set up their business in Bremen since then, enabling local consumers and caterers to choose from even more Fair Trade products. Being the Fair Trade Capital and a Fair Trade Town had an enormous effect on the Fair Trade commitment in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. In the future, the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen will continue to support Fair Trade projects and its promotion. We maintain a constant dialogue with our partners here in Bremen and always try to involve new organizations into our activities. In terms of public procurement, it is our aim to ensure that within the next years all goods and services purchased by the city meet social and ecological standards. Other German L\u00e4nder have already been inspired by Bremen\u00b4s effort and are passing similar laws and are trying to implement Fair Trade into their procurement procedures.

        "France \u2013 Brittany \u2013 Population: 3 273 000 A programme to establish an organic fair trade cotton industry in Mali, co-funded by the WAEMU and the Brittany Region The organic cotton programme was launched in Mali by the operator Helvetas in 1998 with the first organic cotton production trials. Production gradually increased to reach almost 800 tonnes in 2007 and involving over 4,000 producers (of which 33% were female producers). As of 2008, the Brittany Region and the Commission of the West African Econom ic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) provided a grant of \u20ac1,200,000 over 6 years (2008-2013) to support the structuring and the consolidation of gains. The project beneficiary is the Mouvement Biologique Malien (Malian Organic Movement - MoBioM), an umbrella associating regrouping 74 cooperative companies spread over 6 production zones in the cotton basin of the Compagnie Malienne pour le D\u00e9veloppement des Textiles (Malian Textile Development Company - CMDT). The aim of the project is : to contribute to sustainable economic development through organic and fair trade cotton production; to contribute to enhancing the value of productions (job creation and increased revenues) through support for processing (spinning, weaving and manufacturing); to integrate this support into a global approach to ethical economic development, in particularly by drawing on the support of Breton industrial and economic players in the textile industry. Secure and rising operating incomes which benefit the entire population Enable organic cotton producers to make a living from their work by earning a secure income: this priority aim of the programme has required substantial financial support, to help producers master techniques on the one hand, and to compensate for the lower yields than conventional cotton in the first years on the other hand. This was allowed through a guaranteed purchase price and production levels that have continued to rise since 2008.

Organic cotton follows a three year crop rotation, and the availability of land, 2 out of 3 years, provides a substantial opportunity for the development of diverse crop rotations with the potential to expand the markets and incomes of producers. As such, sesame, fonio, millet, sorghum and shea crops have developed considerably in the programme zones, along with market gardening activities. Towards an autonomous MoBioM The organisational and financial autonomy of the MoBioM will allow the industry to continue its development independently. This objective could soon be achieved. Moreover, the substantial commitment of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise du D\u00e9veloppement (French Development Agency) to develop organic fair trade cotton production in West Africa and its marketing will make it possible to consolidate the industry and render it self-sufficient within a short period of time. International solidarity more necessary than ever In 2012 Mali was plunged into an unprecedented crisis which called its territorial integrity into question, a crisis which extends far beyond its borders and which concerns us all. Against this backdrop, the organic fair trade cotton industry, which the Brittany Region has supported alongside the WAEMU since 2008, takes on even greater significance. Development programmes need to be maintained now more than ever, at a time when our Malian partners are in greatest need of an expression of international solidarity. From the producer to the end customer: committed partners throughout the entire chain Since 2008, several companies in the Western textile sector have demonstrated their ambition to support the organic cotton industry in Mali. A best practices partnership has thus been concluded with textile companies including one of the largest, Armor Lux, in Quimper. The commitment of TDV Industries, in Laval, the only French company to handle weaving, spinning and dyeing operations, has made it possible to maintain a direct link between the producers and the manufacturer. 74 ",

Since 2013 another pioneering task has come along: on the 20th of November of 2013 the Ruhr area was elected / awarded \u201cfair trade metropolis\u201d as first greater region in Germany and as first regional association of towns worldwide. 21 cities and communities as well as the county of Wesel, with a total of over four million inhabitants, received the award of the whole Ruhr area through their engagement as fair trade towns and counties. The award was made possible because of the long-standing preparatory work of the network \u201cFair Metropolis Ruhr\u201d. It bundles and links the activities of the civil society, church institutions, and local authorities on the subject of local development cooperation and fair trade in the Ruhr area. In 2010 the Ruhr area was the European capital of culture and presented itself as model region for Europe. With the signature underneath the MAGNA CARTA RUHR.2010, all involved municipalities (54) and counties (4) committed themselves to abstain in their public procurement from products that are produced through exploitative child labor. Thereby the cities and communities of the Ruhr area, with more than five million inhabitants, have paved the way for global responsibility of municipalities in Europe. Since then, an exhibition about exploitative child labour, designed together with Misereor, has raised awareness in many municipalities about this issue. After this success, the participating municipalities set out together to give the subject of \u201cfairness\u201d a new focus. Under the title of \u201cFair Metropolis Ruhr\u201d , the aim is that all communities, cities, and municipalities of the Ruhr area commit to become fair trade towns, communities and municipalities. The continuous development policy education of the One World C enters and groups, campaigns like \u201cDer Pott kocht fair\u201d, which established local fair trade coffee brands in the Ruhr area, the trade fair \u201cFair T rade & Friends\u201d and much more, build a solid basis for this objective.

The City of Ghent cannot accept that the production of consumption goods can result in the unfair treatment of people in other continents. This exploitation is ethically unacceptable, but also creates more tangible problems. Fast fashion, for example, creates a lot of CO2-emmisions and waste and often creates unfair competition to local businesses. For these reasons the City wants to see more and more citizens buy more fair products in more local shops that offer ever more fair alternatives. Tine Heyse, Deputy Mayor for Environment, Climate, Energy and North-South cooperation stated: \u201cIt all starts with political willingness to act. From the onset this project received broad support. This is needed for such projects to succeed. In the strategic multi-annual plan of the city our ambition is explicit: Ghent wants to be recognized as a center of knowledge and innovation for fair trade.\u201d The city of Ghent gives the example. In the local procurement policy not only cost is a decisive factor. Also quality, life cycle costs, ecological criteria as well as social and ethical criteria are included in tenders. This is not always the easy option but it gives an important signal to the citizens and to the market. To stimulate market offer the procurement department aims to announce new social and ethical criteria more than 6 month before the tender is published. The City of Ghent does not only want to contribute to increased awareness of its citizens. It wants to invest in changing purchasing behavior and in corporate responsibility within local economy. For this reason the next years focus will move beyond increasing awareness and will also stimulate supply of fair products in Ghent. A pilot project has been started in the textiles and clothing segment. This pilot initiative starts from an extensive social mapping research that identifies opportunities and threats.

This group will continue working with the results in the coming months and years. The city is creating a toolbox of support for these entrepreneurs that are willing to screen their supply chain with ethical principles. A selected group of young entrepreneurs will form an incubator where their ethical objectives can be tested within the existing market reality. The project is designed to support local businesses to become Fair Entrepreneurs. The city believes it can be an element to make our local economy more resilient towards the challenges of a globalized economy. Fair trade is not only of relevance to producers in other continents, it is important for everybody. In the city of Ghent fair textiles and clothing will become hot topic in the coming years. Market situation will only change if the public demand grows simultaneously with the supply of fairly produced goods. Therefore mayor events will continue to put the issue on the public agenda and make options for sustainable alternatives more visible. On March 1st 2015 Ghent hosted the very first Fair Fashion Fest in Belgium. The Museum of Industrial Archeology and Textile hosted the successful event and proved to be the perfect site to link the cities textile heritage to the many options to opt for fair and sustainable clothes today. Nearly 3.000 visitors attended. The event received national media coverage in print and visual press. Deputy Mayor Schepen Tine Heyse concludes optimistically: \"It is clear that his is a complicated matter. It is therefore of utmost importance to offer guidance to these businesses that show willingness to make more fair choices. It is evenly important to continue communicating clearly about the issue. 78 ",
        "Sweden - Gothenburg - Population: 540,132 The City of Gothenburg has a tradition of working with sustainability and sustainable consumption, where Fair Trade is an important part. Since spring 2011, the city is a certified Fairtrade City (or town). This means that the municipality lives up to the criteria of ethical public procurement, conducts active information work on the subject and provides a certain amount of Fair Trade products in shops, caf\u00e9s and at workplaces. The information work about Fair Trade in Gothenburg includes a variety of lectures for organizations, schools and companies, as well as campaigns and other awareness-raising activities. Some examples of these activities are competitions between caf\u00e9s in fair baking and a strong cooperation between volunteers who continually promote fair trade in different ways. The next step is to further involve the public canteens within the municipality to do more ethical purchases. There is also a steering committee that gathers members from the whole society, including for example politicians, trade unions, the university and retailers. They cooperate and discuss how to best work with information campaigns and other activities in Gothenburg and within their member organizations and networks. The political decision about turning Gothenburg into a Fairtrade City was taken jointly among all the political parties. The large interest for Fair Trade among the citizens of Gothenburg provides a strong motivation to work with responsible public procurement and to continue the work by raising awareness about Fair Trade. Gothenburg\u2019s Fair Trade Support Measures -77% of the procured tea is fair trade - 86% procured coffee is fair trade and/or organic - 40 information events were arranged in 2014 79 ",
        "Germany - Hamburg - Population: 1,750,000 Being a commercial and port city with world-wide links, Hamburg shares responsibility for a fairer world. The award of the Fair Trade Town status means an incentive to further promote the market distribution of fair trade products in Hamburg, always in dialogue with stakeholders of the economy and the civil society (cited from the Hamburg State government programme, 2011). Since 2010 there has been a non-state Fair Trade Promotion Office (FTP) supported by the Hamburg government. It is keeping in touch with local enterprises (industry, retailers, restaurants, hotels) in order to increase imports, processing, sales and consumption of Fair Trade goods. On the other hand, public enterprises owned by the City of Hamburg shall be convinced to introduce social product criteria in their procurement procedures. As early as 2006, a particular local action alliance was formed under the name of \u201chamburg mal (meaning \u201cmultiplied by\u201d) fair\u201d (hmf) gathering state and non-state actors that share their respective interest and knowledge in the field of Fair Trade. Hmf is an educational project enabling multipliers among teenagers and young adults to explain their peer groups the concept and background of Fair Trade. Taking examples from certain products of daily use (such as coffee, cocoa, fruit juices, cotton wear or footballs), hmf makes consumers familiar with topics of world trade and the factors of production in the countries of origin. There is a wide range of creative activities, all related to the Fair Trade subject, such as photo competitions, poetry slams, awareness weeks with top chefs using fair trade ingredients, or student-run companies processing and distributing cotton products (T-shirts, shopping bags). The FTP, for its part, arranges awareness weeks in selective shopping streets and urban quarters with the purpose of motivating a large number of retailers, restaurants and service suppliers to show their commitment for Fair Trade. Both FTP and hmf inform the public on their websites www.fairtradestadt-hamburg.de and www.hamburgmalfair.de A digital Hamburg city map shows most of the places where Fair Trade products are available or committed organizations are based.

        "Germany \u2013 City of Hannover - Population: 518,386 The city council of Hannover decided to sign the Aalborg \u2013 Charta in 1995 and initiated the Agenda21-Buero within the municipal administration. In 2009, the millennium-declaration of the \u201c Deutsche St\u00e4dtetag \u201d (German Cities Council) was signed. The capital of Lower Saxony has shown best practices and set a focus within its municipal administration, it has taken its global responsibility seriously and has initiated the necessary processes. Because of this, Hannover was promoted to Fair Trade Town in 2010. Fair Trade and its issues are located at the Office for Agenda21 and sustainability. The main focuses are development of educational offers for schools and kindergartens as well as implementing social criteria in public procurement. Social criteria are already an issue in public procurement in the City of Hannover. In the common regulation on public procurement it is stated: \"All action must imply the requirements made about tariffs, fair trade / exclusion of abusive child-labour and against illegal work.\" To help suppliers, information about these criteria are handed out at procurement processes and are documented at the end. Also, the Agenda21- and the Sustainability office work as a service centre within the municipal administration on this issue and initiate flagship projects. In raising awareness, all techniques of public relation are used (leaflets, expositions and campaigns). The issue of fair trade is connected with other topics \u2013 e.g. working conditions and sustainable consumption. Hannover organizes the local activities of the national fair trade week in September in cooperation with local NGOs. The World Fair Trade day in May is used to address the municipal employees. On the national level, Hannover is part of the \u201cNetzwerk Faire Beschaffung\u201d (network for fair procurement) and participates at meetings of cities taken part at the biannual competition \u201cHauptstadt fairer Handel\u201d (fair trade capital). On the international level , Hannover participates at \"Procura+\" and occasionally takes part at international FairTrade Town meetings. In 2012/2013, Hannover cooperated with its twin towns in the campaign \u201c Aware and fair\u201d. People from Malawi, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the UK got together with the main goal to raise awareness about the Millennium Development Goals through the example of the situation in Malawi via the subject of Fair Trade.

Within this campaign, Blantyre (Malawi) could promote their fair trade goods (sugar, rice, tea, coffee and nuts) and a list of producers of these goods was made for large- scale consumers. Besides learning units on poverty, fair trade education was developed to be used in Hannover as well as in Blantyre. Within the campaign \u201ekommunale Klimapartnerschaften\u201c (muncipal climate cooperation) the City of Hannover cooperates with Bel\u00e9n de los Andaqu\u00edes (Colombia). There, cacao is grown organically by small farmers.

        "Germany - Leipzig - Population: 531,582 \u2018Leipzig handelt fair / Leipzig deals fairly\u2019 \u2013 tradition and progress unite in the 1000- year-old city of trade and fairs. Fair-trade is an integral aspect of sustainability, and Leipzig has committed to a sustainable development that will ensure its future growth. The city\u2019s decision -making relies on the guidance provided by this commitment, notably through the continued work and processes of the framework of the local Agenda 21. Sustainable planning and trading are inspired by both a sense of inter-generational responsibility, as well as consideration for global justice within the current generation. These principles are the foundation for Leipzig\u2019s fair -trade promoting activities. Further impulses for the promotion of the fair-trade creed might emanate from the European level, however, additional support is needed to highlight these principles on the community-level. It has become apparent in Leipzig that, providing that both the supply and the demand side are sufficiently motivated, the principles of fair-trade can be effectively fostered. Not only can this motivation stem from the recognition of the utility of balanced ecological, economic and social living conditions, but also from legislative frameworks. The city\u2019s administration is devoted to the ILO\u2019s core labor standards - the core of the fair-trade spirit and current applicable law. The public authorities act as role-models and are therefore required to complete trading functions accordingly. Naturally, this involves ethical considerations. The city of Leipzig has developed a \u2018concept for sustainable and fair procurement\u2019 within its own procurement planning, and will implement this over the coming years. Currently, the procurement regulations on supply and performance are under revision. In cooperation with the city\u2019s parents\u2019 council, publicizing and provision of meals at schools and nurseries are being improved in compliance with fair-trade criteria. The city of Leipzig has been member of the Fairtrade Town steering group since the decision to become a Fairtrade Town was made. In this function it operates and/or supports numerous relevant activities with a wide public reach. Moreover, the city of Leipzig supports associations that undertake educational work in this area.

A variety of partners within the city have collaborated to supply Leipzig with fair-trade coffee (notably Verein St\u00e4dtepartnerschaft Leipzig-Addis Abeba e.V. and Evangelisch- Lutherisches Missionswerk Leipzig e.V.). This coffee is produced by, and purchased from, farmers of the Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union; an association with 35 member cooperatives in Central and South Ethiopia. The priority is the sustainable cultivation of coffee. The profits made from fair-trade sales to Europe and the USA are used to fund charitable projects in Ethiopia.

        "Czech Republic \u2013 Litomerice \u2013 Population: 23,462 Steering Committee - Gateway to the systematic fair trade development and wide cooperation The Fair Trade Steering Committee was established in 2011 as the key element of the municipality\u00b4s effort to achieve Fair Trade Town status. Since that time, it has evolved in a platform where partners from various fields of expertise (schools, town library, businesses, but also student parliament, active seniors groups and charity) meet regularly every two months or so to discuss what has been achieved and what to do next. This diverse environment brings fresh ideas and allows seeing issues from different angles. Equally important is a systematic work owing to Action plans developed every year. This plan defines the priorities and main goals for the period as well as the indicators for measuring the implementation and the achievements. Thus, we can clearly see the progress that has been achieved and this can be effectively communicated to town councillors and the public. Apart from campaigns and other awareness-raising activities, we consider this entity as one of the key elements of a successful fair trade town in the long term. Fair trade grants for small projects with great impact The municipality established a specific grant scheme financially supporting various civil organisations as well as individuals active in the fair trade field in the town in 2014. The main aim is to engage and support active people and their ideas on fair trade and allow them to turn them into reality. Moreover, all activities supported by this grant scheme have to somehow contribute to the actual fair trade Action Plan priorities. This, again, is part of the systematic work, but also significantly widens the impact on fair trade publicity that would otherwise not be possible. Owing to this grant scheme, we have developed new activities such as \u201cWelcoming First -Year Pupils at School with a Fair Trade P ack\u201d explaining what fair trade is about or \u201cPublic Reading\u201d on fair trade in the town library and many other activities informing about fair trade in a popular and interactive way always specifically designed to various target groups such as seniors, kids, mothers with babies etc. The grant scheme has been very successful and we plan to develop it in the next years.

        "Germany \u2013 Munich \u2013 Population: 1.47 million Municipalities have huge economic power as contracting authorities, which means they can use their purchasing and procurement in favour of decent working conditions in global production and trade and also serve as a model for urban society. Munich city council decided by an overwhelming majority in 2011, and again in 2013, to shift its purchasing further towards fair and sustainable procurement as a way of meeting its responsibilities in this matter. At the same time, and especially with its 2013 decision, the council was also thinking of the city's population and how to encourage it to purchase free trade products. The city council is regularly updated on progress on this front (next report: 2015/2016). As a result of these decisions, the city's procurement is being shifted step by step and product by product to fair trade, with trustworthy and recognised labels indicative of social standards being required (for products such as building stone, stitched sports balls, flowers and food). There are different hurdles to be overcome with each product: for example, not all of the eight core ILO labour standards can be fully implemented in the case of building stone, and only footballs and handballs are available as a fair trade option. In coming years, attention will be turned in particular to textiles, toys, IT equipment and wood. One thing especially has proved costly and difficult and that is verifying labelling or equivalent means of proof. For competition reasons, labels and the like can only be excluded where they demonstrably do not meet fair trade criteria. The fact that the term \"fair\" is neither defined in law nor legally protected is a problem. Munich city council works with recognised labels and with standards linked to the ILO labour standards. In some areas (such as IT equipment) no labelled products exist. To get the message across to the people of Munich, we have co-opted the Nord S\u00fcd Forum M\u00fcnchen e.V., which, together with the city's Eine Welt (One World) office, provides information and raises awareness in the city about fair trade. Nord S\u00fcd Forum receives a subsidy from the city for this to provide staffing and material.

Neumarkt was awarded twice in the National Competition \u201cCapital City of Fair Trade\u201d (4th position in 2011 and 2nd in 2013). Fairtrade in Neumarkt is based on a strong \u201cOne World Initiative\u201d of several NGOs, in particular the One World Shop Neumarkt. The Town of Neumarkt has integrated the issue Fairtrade in its sustainability strategy in 2004. The motivation of the Town of Neumarkt to support Fairtrade is firstly a question of positive public relations, but mainly pointing out the responsibility as well as the possibility of a municipality to support a sustainable development worldwide. Fairtrade is an excellent and perhaps the only \u201csystem\u201d to guarantee social standard s in global trade. There are plenty of initiatives and projects in Neumarkt to support Fair Trade. Amongst other things, examples are: (cid:120) Establishment of supporting Fair Trade in the Guiding Principles of the Town Development 2004. (cid:120) Establishment of Fair Trade standards in the public procuring entity 2007. (cid:120) Financial support from the Town of Neumarkt for projects in the field of education for sustainable development in matters of Fair Trade themes.

Pays de Loire received the \"Titre Territoire de Commerce Equitable\" title (TDCE), which is the French version of \"Fair Trade Towns\". Since then, the regional Council of Pays de la Loire is committed to make its territory an emblematic space for fair trade, in realizing five goals: to pass a Council resolution supporting Fairtrade, to make a range of Fairtrade products available in the area\u2019s shops & catering establishments, to promote the use of fair trade products in a number of workplaces & community organizations, to attract media coverage & popular support for the campaign, to convene a local Fairtrade steering group to ensure commitment to Fairtrade Town status. In order to assert their engagement and meet the objectives of this title, the councilor Laurent Martinez, in charge of Fair Trade, has created a regional Fairtrade Council in February 2012 (Conseil Lig\u00e9rien du Commerce Equitable), a recognized platform where the exchanges, dialogues and actions confirm the dynamic position of the Pays de la Loire territory as a pioneer of fair trade in France. From this event which gathers over 200 people each year, three important projects were born: In 2014, a project in Cameroon with the creation of an educational fair trade industry dedicated to cocoa as working and partnership support, as part of the twinning north/south of two agricultural establishments: the Regional high school of Agriculture in Ebolowa (Cameroon) and the Jules Rieffel high school in St Herblain (France). The operational project is to set up a factory processing cocoa into chocolate in the \"CRA Ebolowa\", which will be used as an educational workshop. The second project in 2014 was the group of Fair Trade Ambassadors, which raises awareness among high school students and apprentices regarding this topic. In 2015, the idea is to create a Fair Trade music festival supported by the wishes of the Fair Trade Towns to act together for this cause. Today, seven Fair Trade Towns are already stakeholders in the project, which will take place on the 18th of July, 2015. The performances of each city will be broadcast live to promote this concept and to move from a local to an international mobilization. The creation of a Council of this scale reflects a flawless mobilization of our regional Council of Pays de la Loire on this and helps to bring official recognition to its operators.

The Polish Fair Trade Association (PFTA) together with the City of Pozna \u0144 through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have been participated in the Aware & Fair project funded by the EU in 2011- 2013. One of the project objectives was that Pozna \u0144 would meet the goals for becoming the Fair Trade Town. Since the beginning of the project the Department of Environmental Protection has been purchasing Fair Trade products within direct purchasing (orders up to 10,000 \u20ac). FT products were served on the variety of project meetings as well as conferences organized by the Town Hall with the participation of the DEP. Until recently, purchases were being made for products such as coffee, tea, dried fruits, chocolate. Furthermore, within the Aware & Fair project, the DEP purchased 100 Fairtrade certificated soccer balls, which were designed as the prize for a competition among students in schools of Pozna \u0144 . Within the project , the DEP ordered a delivery of small Fair Trade chocolates (10g) with the logo of the city as well as bags from FT certified cotton that are still being used until today. One of the best opportunities for purchasing and serving Fair Trade products in the Pozna \u0144 Town Hall was the 6th International FTT Conference, held in November 2012. During the conference Pozna \u0144 was awarded the title of Fair Trade Town. The conference, financed in part from EU project budget, brought the opportunity to serve the FT products on coffee breaks and at the end of the conference, participants received traditional St.Martin's croissant, produced with FT ingredients (cane sugar, raisins, almonds, cocoa). Since that time, the FT products has been permanently used by Poznan City Hall, particularly during events organized by the Department of Environmental Protection.

        "United Kingdom - Scotland - Population: 5,327,700 Scotland: A Fair Trade Nation In January 2007 the Scottish Executive (as the Scottish Government was then known) working with a group of Fair Trade campaigners, Scotland-based non- governmental organisations and representatives from Scottish civic society formed a co-ordinating body , the Scottish Fair Trade Forum. A key focus for the Forum was to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and, in particular, help secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland. The idea of Fair Trade Nation first grew out of the Fair Trade Town movement. It was defined by criteria drawn up jointly by the then Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government in 2006. These set out the commitments that the Scottish Parliament, Government, local authorities and other public bodies as well as civic society, businesses and consumers, needed to make to earn Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland. The Scottish Government\u2019s approach to Fair Trade has been to offer support for the network of Fair Trade campaigners, civic society groups and businesses in Scotland through the Scottish Fair Trade Forum, awarding the organisation core funding from its International Development Fund since its inception. The Forum advocates that businesses commit to fairness within their workforce, and towards their producers and customers. The Forum\u2019s commitment to Fair Trade is drawn from the resolve to challenge global poverty and its recognition for the need for fairness in international trading to preserve the dignity and rights of producers overseas. As such, the Scottish Government has been an instrumental supporter of the Fair Trade Nation campaign and continues to provide core funding to the Scottish Fair Trade Forum.

Until now, these contacts have taken practical form mainly in our regular promotion of fair trade among our respective members, the local authorities of Wallonia and Brussels, using our various communication channels: website, newsletter, monthly magazine, etc. These explain fair trade issues and the steps to be taken for municipalities to obtain the fair trade label, as well as the actions aimed at life in the municipalities, such as the Semaine du commerce \u00e9quitable (Fair Trade Week), Ma classe en fait un Max! (My class does the Max!) or the in-depth discussions held with the UVCW \u2019s public contracts expert consultant, Mr Mathieu Lambert, on the position of fair trade in public contracts in the context of public service supplies procurement. In the future we are planning, together with the fair trade platform referred to above, to organise information sessions for our members on this subject, which is becoming increasingly important among the municipalities and to which we are happy to be able to contribute through the promotion we undertake and wish to develop further. This can be seen from the tab that will shortly be dedicated to fair trade in the Europe-International space on the UVCW website, providing visitors with full details and useful links on this subject, including in particular a link to the website of the Commune du commerce equitable (Fair trade municipality) campaign which currently has around twenty municipalities that bear the label and over a hundred others that are candidates to become fair trade municipalities in Wallonia and Brussels.
