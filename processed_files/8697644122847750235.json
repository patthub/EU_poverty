        "5 After more than fifty years of the EESC fulfilling its mission as advisory body to the EU institutions, I find this superb metaphor of the Committee as a bridge or, better still, a bridge-builder, to be increasingly apt. What we do here is provide a link between the EU institutions and the people of Europe represented on the Committee by their employers, trade unions and various associations. Our \u201cbridging\u201d role is two-fold: we connect EU legislators and regulators to the Member States\u2019 expertise, acquired at grassroots level, and furthermore we also strive to reach out to more citizens\u2019 organisations at European and national level. With this idea in mind, I have made Engaging people for a sustainable Europe the political message of my term of office. I believe \u201cengagement\u201d and \u201csustainability\u201d are two key drivers for the future of Europe. We need engaged citizens to achieve reforms; and the success of reforms needs to be measured not just in terms of short-term economic growth or financial gains, but in terms of the sustainability of current and future generations. My work programme for the next two and a half years has three main priorities: dialogue and participation, sustainability and growth, and solidarity and development. Under my presidency, the Committee will strengthen its role as an institutional forum for participation, consultation and dialogue at EU level, especially now when the Lisbon Treaty has made civil dialogue a democratic principle of EU governance. from the President ",
        "6 Under the sustainability and growth priority, the EESC has a key role to play in making the Europe 2020 strategy a reality; a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, to achieve economic recovery and reduce unemployment. Stakeholders in the Member States need to assume true ownership of the Europe 2020 strategy. The Committee will take part in the debates on green and ethical entrepreneurship, the benefits of the social economy, the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and consumer policies. We are not merely talking about these landmark policies, but presenting well researched, feasible and balanced opinions to policy-makers and all other stakeholders. 6 ",
        "7 I am also aware that the EESC needs to keep pace with global developments. Through its Sustainable Development Observatory, the EESC will take the initiative of coordinating a number of joint positions of European organisations and representing civil society in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio in 2012 (Rio+20). Europe can position itself as champion and role model at international level in the arena of sustainable development. This publication will provide more information about who we are and what we do. Our opinions, drawn up by Committee members, convey this even more effectively. It is our members who are the real bridge-builders. Staffan NILSSON President of the European Economic and Social Committee, 2010-2013 ",
        "8 What is the 8 2 ",
        "9 The European Economic and Social Committee is an EU consultative body consisting of representatives of the various economic, social and civic components of organised civil society. It was set up in 1957, when the European Union\u2019s founders signed the Rome Treaties. Their aim was to involve different economic and social interest groups in the development of the common market, and to enable the European Commission and the Council of Ministers to consult more widely on EU policies. The first plenary meeting of the Committee took place in Brussels, in May 1958. 2.1 A unique role: what makes the EESC special? People must be at the heart of a successful Europe, and the European Economic and Social Committee sets out to guarantee that the voices of all the different groups and interests in society are heard and considered at the very highest levels of EU policy-shaping and decision-making. The members of the Committee are selected from many walks of life, and nominated by national governments meeting in the Council. Therefore, they reflect a wide range of experience, and maintain day-to-day contact with their fellow citizens in different countries and sectors of the economy and society. They understand people\u2019s practical wishes and concerns. ",
        "10 The EESC has a distinctive place in the European Union\u2019s decision-making process, as a consultative body which is an intermediary between the \u201cexecutive\u201d (the Commission), and \u201clegislature\u201d (the European Parliament and the Council). It is a unique forum for representing and informing civil society organisations and expressing their views. Bringing consensus The Committee members play an integral part in the process of policy formation and the preparation of decisions at EU level. Representing the general interest, the Committee delivers opinions to the EU institutions, seeking to achieve a positive consensus between positions which are often different, and at times contradictory. This process, and the continual quest for compromise, involves representatives of public and private-sector employers\u2019 organisations, employees, and also \u2013 and this is the distinguishing feature of the EESC \u2013 other sections of organised civil society, such as farmers, the liberal professions, consumers, environmental protection groups, groups combating poverty and exclusion, young people, families, older people, women, people with disabilities, etc. Consulting the Committee enables the EU\u2019s decision-making bodies to gain a better idea of both the impact Commission proposals are likely to have on those most directly concerned, and what changes may be necessary to garner wider public support. ",
        "11 The Treaties require the EESC to be consulted on proposals in many fields of EU action. In addition, the Committee also makes known its views on subjects of which the institutions may have taken insufficient or no account, by means of own-initiative opinions or information reports. Boosting transparency The Committee\u2019s expertise, its discussions and negotiations, the identification of differences in opinion and the search for convergence all serve to improve the quality and credibility of the EU\u2019s decision-making process, making it more comprehensible and acceptable for Europe\u2019s citizens and increasing the transparency which is so vital for democracy. In this way, the concept of representative democracy is complemented by the concept of participatory democracy, in which the EU\u2019s economic, social and civic players have a real say. The challenges the EU faces today give the Committee a growing importance and added value in the Union\u2019s institutional set-up. The issues at stake mean that all citizens, and first and foremost those who are in close contact with the economic and social reality of their countries and are the driving force behind European society, must be involved. As an institutional forum both for dialogue and for consultation, the Committee continues to play a dual role, strengthening democratic voices in the European integration process and bringing the EU closer 11 ",
        "12 to its citizens. In so doing, it contributes to strengthening the Union\u2019s democratic legitimacy and the development of a European consciousness and acts as a real bridge between the Union and civil society across Europe. Building links European and national civil society organisations, including socio-economic organisations \u2013 employers and trade unions \u2013 meet regularly at the EESC and participate actively in conferences and hearings organised by the Committee. Their European or national experts help to enrich the debates when opinions are drawn up, through their knowledge and experience in the field. Relations between Committee members and the national civil society organisations to which they belong ensure a broad flow of information on the initiatives and activities of the EESC and the European Union generally. They do much to increase awareness of the realities of the EU and enhance opinion-forming in the organisations themselves. The Committee is also keen to be a better and more effective portal and listening post for organised civil society. This desire for openness and interchange is expressed through numerous initiatives \u2013 seminars, hearings, conferences and forums \u2013 involving civil society organisations, including ",
        "13 European ones, which are not, or are only indirectly, represented at the Committee. The EESC also set up a Liaison Group with European civil society organisations and networks. Through these initiatives, some of which are conducted at the request of the EU institutions, in particular the Commission, the EESC is better able to reflect the diversity of organised civil society and its development. It also promotes a broader structured dialogue between organised civil society and the EU institutions, and between civil society organisations themselves. ",
        "14 2.2 What is its mission? There are three key elements to the EESC\u2019s mission: y Advising the Commission, the Council and the Parliament on policy proposals, making use of the special expertise and practical experience of its members, and thereby contributing to the EU decision-making process; y Enabling civil society organisations in the Union to be more involved, and therefore more committed to the European venture, at both national and European level, and to help bring Europe closer to its citizens; and y Strengthening the role of civil society organisations in non-EU countries or blocs (or groups of countries) where it has ongoing relations, developing a structured dialogue between civil society organisations, especially the social partners, and promoting consultative models along similar lines to the EESC. ",
        "15 2.3 How does it take action? When the Treaties require the Council or the Commission to consult the Committee on a particular proposal, consultation of the EESC is mandatory. In other cases it is optional. The EESC may also adopt opinions on its own initiative. The Single European Act (1986) and the Maastricht Treaty (1992) extended the range of issues which must be referred to the Committee, in particular the new policies (regional and environment policy). The Amsterdam Treaty (1997) further broadened the range of compulsory consultation and allowed the European Parliament to consult the EESC formally for the first time. The Lisbon Treaty (2010) expands the areas in which the Committee must be consulted to three new areas of EU policy: sport, the European Research Area and energy. In addition, Article 11 of the new Treaty on European Union gives the Committee more opportunities to fully play its role of pre-eminent intermediary between organised civil society and the decision-making bodies of the EU. This article enshrines the role of civil society in the European process. 15 ",
        "16 The EESC can: y Issue opinions on questions that are referred to it by the Commission, the Council or the Parliament; y Issue own-initiative opinions, expressing its views on any matter it thinks fit; and y Issue exploratory opinions when the Commission, the Parliament or even Union Presidencies ask it to reflect and make suggestions on a given subject. These suggestions may later lead to a proposal from the Commission. The Committee may also decide to prepare an information report examining any question relevant to EU policies. Finally, following a proposal from a section, a group or a third of its members, it may agree resolutions on topical issues. Under EU law, in taking its final decisions, the Council must consider the Committee\u2019s opinions, whether mandatory or optional. As part of efforts to improve liaison between EU institutions, the Commission and the EESC signed a cooperation agreement in November 2005 identifying key areas where the Committee has particular expertise and can offer significant added value to EU measures: the Lisbon Strategy \u2014 which has now become the \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 strategy \u2014, sustainable development, ",
        "17 structural change, impact analyses of European legislation and the EU\u2019s external relations. To boost cooperation at EU level, the EESC and European civil society organisations and networks set up a Liaison Group in September 2004. The Group is a forum for political dialogue, and sets out to: y guarantee a coordinated EESC approach to European civil society organisations and networks; and y follow up joint initiatives. This initiative helps the EESC to raise the profile and influence of organised civil society at European level, and to consolidate its own role as the institutional representative of organised civil society and spokesperson for its concerns, expectations and aspirations. ",
        "18 2.4 Cooperating with counterparts in the Member States The Committee has regular contacts with economic and social councils in the EU Member States in order to reinforce structured dialogue between all the players in organised civil society, and to promote grass-roots involvement in building Europe. The EESC and its national counterparts share the conviction that economic and social policies which have a direct impact on people\u2019s lives (such as jobs, social rights and social dialogue, the knowledge-based society, public services and the Lisbon Strategy) require closer cooperation between consultative bodies at both national and European level. With this aim in mind, conferences have been jointly organised in the countries holding the EU presidency. Moreover, the presidents and secretaries-general of economic and social councils and the EESC meet regularly, with national councils taking turns to host. These meetings allow discussion of key questions on the EU political agenda: for example, in 2006 and 2008 joint reports were presented to the Spring European Council. These reports focused on the implementation of the Lisbon process in all Member States and were transmitted to EU heads of state and government. 18 ",
        "19 The EESC backs moves by the social partners, other civil society organisations and governments to set up economic and social councils, especially in Member States and candidate countries which do not yet have them. Similar support is provided to governments outside the EU in order to set up not only economic and social councils but also round tables for facilitating civil dialogue, such as the EU-India Round Table. Finally, the EESC is a member of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions (AICESIS), set up in 1999, with 60 full and affiliated member countries. This association aims to boost organised civil society\u2019s influence in the context of globalisation. The EESC makes a difference The Committee adds an important and constructive dimension to the EU decision-making process, and is a valuable support to organised civil society across the Member States. Two types of opinions are especially effective in bringing home the EESC\u2019s views to policy-makers: y Own-initiative opinions often raise awareness among decision makers, particularly in the Commission, about topics that may have been overlooked, and lay the groundwork for timely responses. ",
        "20 y Exploratory opinions drawn up at the request of other institutions, in advance of the Commission drafting its own proposals, allow all the various interests represented in civil society to put forward their demands and concerns. They also enable the EESC to uncover areas where action is needed at EU level. Since it was founded over 50 years ago, the EESC has made a difference across the range of EU policy and law-making through opinions and advice informed by organised civil society. The publication Shaping Europe: Recent EESC achievements demonstrates, through a whole range of recent practical examples, how the Committee is working to improve people\u2019s lives not only within the EU, but also further afield. The EESC is increasingly viewed as a \u201cpool of expertise\u201d, in touch with key issues and the attitudes of ordinary citizens. The scope of EESC influence is reflected in the diversity of topics covered: they range from fighting the mafia to encouraging volunteering; ",
        "21 from protecting consumers\u2019 rights to promoting partnership with Europe\u2019s eastern neighbours or Latin American countries; from encouraging migrants\u2019 integration to helping cyclists to get around in the EU.

        "23 The Treaty states that \u201cthe Committee shall consist of representatives of organisations of employers, of the employed and of other parties representative of civil society, notably in socio-economic, civic, professional and cultural areas\u201d. The EESC now has 344 members, nominated by national governments for a renewable five-year term and drawn from across Europe\u2019s different economic and social interest groups.

        "24 3.1 The Groups Under its Rules of Procedure, the Committee is divided into three groups, representing employers, workers and other representatives and stakeholders of civil society, particularly in the economic, civic, professional and cultural fields. Each group has its own secretariat. EESC members themselves choose which group they wish to join. (Occasionally members choose not to belong to any group.) The Employers Group (Group I) President: Henri MALOSSE (FR) www.eesc.europa.eu/employers-group/ The members of the Employers Group come from the private and public sectors. They are entrepreneurs and representatives of entrepreneur associations working in industry, commerce, banking, insurance, agriculture and services in the 27 Member States of the European Union. These are women and men involved in the business world and in touch with the realities of everyday life who are willing to put their experience to use to further the European venture. The Employers Group works closely with BUSINESSEUROPE (Union of Industrial and Employers\u2019 Confederations of Europe), EUROCHAMBRES (Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry), ",
        "25 EUROCOMMERCE (Retail, Wholesale and International Trade Representation), CEEP (European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation), and on a regular basis with numerous industry sector organisations at European level. The Employers Group\u2019s policy reflects the opinion of European entrepreneurs in supporting the development of an EU of free-market economies with freedom of trade and movement within the Internal Market, in the belief that this is the best road to growth, competitiveness and employment. The Employers Group takes the view that the EESC and its tripartite structure offers a unique way of achieving consensus on EU policies and serves as a model for wider European society. A strong, coherent and dynamic Employers Group is therefore crucial to making the voice of business heard at European level. The Workers Group (Group II) President: Georgios DASSIS (EL) www.eesc.europa.eu/workers-group/ The Workers Group (Group II) comprises representatives from national trade unions, confederations and sectoral federations. Its members represent over 80 trade union organisations \u2013 the vast majority of them affiliated to the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) or its sectoral federations. ",
        "26 Although the European social model is an example for much of the world, there are still too many people suffering hardship or excluded from society because of poverty, discrimination, lack of education, or other disadvantages. Group II\u2019s key priorities have always been full employment, improving the living and working conditions of workers in Europe and the well-being of all EU citizens, as well as of workers and their families in other continents. It is firmly committed to the enlargement and strengthening of the EU as an area of prosperity, freedom and democracy, mutual support, solidarity and social cohesion, and aims to ensure that workers can play a real part in European policy-making. The Various Interests Group (Group III) President: Luca JAHIER (IT) www.eesc.europa.eu/various-interests-group/ The composition of the EESC reflects the changing face of European society. The presence of the Various Interests Group, alongside the Employers and Workers Groups, ensures that the Committee hears the voices and concerns of the full range of social, occupational, economic and cultural organisations that make up civil society. ",
        "27 What gives Group III its unique identity is the diversity of people within its ranks: its members are drawn from farmers\u2019 organisations, small businesses, the crafts and professions, cooperatives and non-profit associations, consumer and environmental groups, NGOs and associations representing families, disabled people, and the scientific and academic community, etc. They are bound together by their sense of responsibility towards EU citizens whose interests they represent. Their standpoint is that in order to pursue these interests effectively, all social and economic players must be involved in shaping European Union decisions. The shared goal of the group is to achieve real economic, social and participatory democracy in the EU. ",

For each opinion, the section concerned generally sets up a study group assisted by experts and appoints a rapporteur. When issues are relevant to more than one of its sections, the EESC may set up a temporary sub-committee. Sub-committees operate in much the same way as sections, but their task is confined to examining a particular problem by a given deadline.

        "51 The impact of globalisation and the growing importance of international relations between the EU and the rest of the world have heightened the need for the parallel development of relations between societies. The \u2018new players\u2019 in international relations, in particular the representatives of civil society organisations, are called upon to play an increasingly important role in tandem with those traditionally involved in cross-border issues. Alongside the EU Council, the Commission and the Parliament, the Committee therefore makes a unique contribution to the Union\u2019s foreign policy by championing the \u201ccivil society\u201d dimension. The Committee\u2019s role is not confined to issuing opinions and recommendations to the other EU institutions. It also operates directly, at the request of political authorities or on the basis of international treaties, in third countries by developing dialogue with representatives of civil society organisations and contributing to the establishment of consultative structures. outwards ",
