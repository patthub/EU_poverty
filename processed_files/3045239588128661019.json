        "Climate Action Assessment of climate action How to assess the mainstreaming of climate action in Cooperation Programmes ETC European Territorial Cooperation under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) 2014-2020 \u00a9EEA ",
        "2 Introduction This Fact Sheet outlines the main issues to be considered when assessing the mainstreaming of climate action in the Cooperation Programmes of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to support European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) for the period 2014- 2020. A separate Fact Sheet describes the potential for mainstreaming of climate action in the ETC Programmes. The ERDF is one of the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Apart from European Territorial Cooperation, the fund also supports the goal of Investment for Growth and Jobs. The Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) 1 for the ESIF sets the overall framework and Thematic Objectives (TOs) for all Programmes under the ERDF. A fund specific regulation defines the contents of the Cooperation Programmes. The ETC Regulation (ETCR) further establishes investment priorities of the programmes, additional to those of the ERDF Regulation under the Growth and Jobs goal 2 . Guidance issued by the Commission provides details on the programme document structure and contents. The assessment of mainstreaming of climate action in the Cooperation Programmes will focus on five areas of the programme document: 1. Strategic approach 2. Priority axes and investment priorities 3. Financing plan 4. Territorial development aspects 5. Implementation arrangements. It is essential that the assessment considers the specific regional context of the Programme, the trans-boundary nature of climate challenges and relevant climate mitigation and adaptation issues. The assessment will investigate how climate action has been incorporated and indicate areas where further climate action would be relevant. Strategic approach The climate assessment will address the Programme\u2019s contribution to the climate change objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The assessment will evaluate the needs identified and the proposed approach for contributing to the fulfilment of these objectives. Also included is an assessment of the promotion of sustainable development and climate action in programme preparation and implementation. The assessment will explore whether the strategy for climate action takes into account national, regional and cross-border/transnational strategies which address climate change. This includes any macro- regional or sea-basin strategies adopted by Member States. The consistency between the selection of TOs and investment priorities and the indicative funding allocation to TOs with programme climate objectives will also be assessed. The assessment will also take stock of the conclusions of relevant supporting documents that accompany the programmes, e.g. the ex- ante evaluation and the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). Priority axes and investment priorities The mainstreaming of climate action across the programmes will be assessed with a focus on those investment priorities which have the greatest potential for climate action. For each of the priority axes, the climate assessment will cover the relevant investment priorities, the types of actions and selection of operations. The assessment will verify consistency between, on the one hand, the strategic approach and the anticipated contribution to the Europe 2020 Strategy, and on the other, the specific objectives, foreseen actions and principles for selection of operations. The assessment will furthermore investigate how the principle of sustainable development has been addressed. Financing plan A key indicator for climate action at Member State level is the share of ESIF support that will be used for climate change objectives. This relates to the target that climate related expenditure will correspond to at least 20 % of the EU budget in the period 2014-2020. The indicative share envisaged for the Programme will be assessed against this objective and against the programme scope. Territorial development aspects The overall approach to territorial development will be assessed for exploiting opportunities arising from synergies in climate action across borders and at the transnational level. Implementation arrangements The assessment will verify whether action has been taken to involve relevant partners in the preparation and implementation of the Programme. 1 Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, published in the Official Journal, OJ 347 20.12.2013 2 Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013, published in the Official Journal, OJ 347 ",

        "4 5 Background information Why do we need to take climate action? Tackling climate change is one of the great challenges facing the EU and its global partners. The need for urgent action is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the EU 20/20/20 targets for climate change mitigation, i.e. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % (30 % if the conditions are right); to reduce energy consumption by 20 % through increased energy efficiency; and to meet 20 % of energy needs from renewable sources. Climate change is already happening and its effects will become more severe in coming years. So we need to take action on mitigation, and we also need to act to protect people, buildings, infrastructure, businesses and ecosystems from the impacts. These adaptation measures, which will make us more resilient to the adverse impacts of climate change, will become increasingly important. Adaptation measures can be taken at national, regional and local levels. Adaptation measures include, for example, actions that can stimulate more efficient water use, and the development and implementation of design standards that protect constructions against the impacts of future climate conditions and extreme weather events. Other examples include building flood defences, raising the levels of dykes, and replacing exposed power overhead lines with underground cables. It also includes measures to take advantage of possible opportunities arising from climate change. The aim of the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change is to help make Europe more climate-resilient and enhance its preparedness and capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change. Building a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy will enhance Europe\u2019s competitiveness, create new, greener jobs, improve energy security and bring health benefits to Europe\u2019s citizens by making the air cleaner. EU funding over the period 2014-2020 The EU budget has an important role to play in promoting climate action in all sectors of the European economy and in catalysing the investments needed to meet the climate targets and ensure climate resilience. Investment is needed in a wide range of technologies that improve energy efficiency, in renewable energy sources and related infrastructure, and in the adaptation to climate change. Based on a proposal put forward by the Commission, the European Council concluded on 7-8 February 2013 that \u2018Climate action objectives will represent at least 20 % of EU spending in the period 2014-2020 and therefore be reflected in the appropriate instruments to ensure that they contribute to strengthen energy security, building a low-carbon, resource efficient and climate-resilient economy that will enhance Europe\u2019s competitiveness and create more and greener jobs\u2019. European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) ESIF include the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Cohesion Fund (CF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). The ultimate responsibility for implementing the EU budget lies with the European Commission, but the ESIF are implemented under \u2019shared management\u2019, with individual EU countries actually distributing the funds and managing expenditure. Checks and balances are in place to ensure the funds are managed properly and in accordance with the rules. Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) The CPR sets out the means to achieve consistency with the economic policies of the EU and its Member States, coordination mechanisms among the ESI Funds and with other EU policies and instruments, horizontal principles and cross-cutting policy objectives. It lays down arrangements to address territorial challenges, suggests action with high European added value and sets out the principles and the priorities for action. Each Member State will prepare a Partnership Agreement, in cooperation with its partners and in dialogue with the Commission. In preparing the Partnership Agreement, each Member State translates the elements set out in the CPR into the national context and sets firm commitments to achieve the EU\u2019s objectives through the programming of the ESIF. ESIF will be implemented through programmes in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Each programme will cover the period 2014 - 2020. It will set out a strategy explaining how the programme will address the national and/or regional needs and contribute to the EU\u2019s strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in line with the applicable regulations and the Partnership Agreement. The CPR defines eleven Thematic Objectives (TOs), which will contribute to the implementation of the EU\u2019s strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The eleven TOs are: 1. Strengthening research, technological development and innovation 2. Enhancing access to, and use and quality of, ICT (information and communication technologies) 3. Enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs, of the agricultural sector (for the EAFRD) and of the fishery and aquaculture sector (for the EMFF) 4. Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors 5. Promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention and management 6. Preserving and protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency 7. Promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures 8. Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility 9. Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination 10. Investing in education, training and vocational training for skills and lifelong learning 11. Enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration The fund-specific regulations define for each TO the corresponding investment priorities. TO4 and TO5 are dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition, climate action issues can be mainstreamed into other TOs. Hence, ESIF can significantly contribute to the achievement of the climate objectives and the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. ",
        "5 M L - 04 - 15 - 199 - E N - N European Territorial Cooperation (ETC), which is under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), will make a major contribution to the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient Europe. This Fact Sheet outlines key issues to be considered when assessing climate mainstreaming in ETC programmes. The ETC is a goal under the ERDF. The ERDF is one of the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) under the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). These funds play a key role in achieving the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The five funds will contribute to the target that climate-related expenditure will represent at least 20 % of EU spending in the period 2014-2020, while helping to improve energy security, build a low-carbon, resource-efficient and climate-resilient economy that will boost Europe\u2019s competitiveness and create more and greener jobs. The ETC covers cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation and interregional cooperation. The CPR defines eleven Thematic Objectives that will contribute to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. The ETC covers all eleven Thematic Objectives. There is a potential for mainstreaming climate action in all Thematic Objectives. By doing so, the ETC can contribute towards reaching at least 20 % climate-related expenditure out of the overall EU budget.
