        "Foreword 3 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait F ore w ord It is an honour for both Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, and Statistics Korea (KOSTAT) to present this Statistical Book that gives, for the first time, a wide-ranging statistical portrait of the EU in comparison with the Republic of Korea. For the European Union, Korea is a key, like-minded partner in an increasingly important part of the world. The EU-Korea relationship has evolved over the past few years, based on shared values, common issues of global concern and the increasing role of both partners on the world stage. This was demonstrated by the signing of two agreements during 2010: the new EU-Korea Framework Agreement and Free Trade Agreement which helped cement a broad and comprehensive relationship. These Agreements will boost trade and investment relations, underpin political dialogue, help step up coordination and dialogue on global issues, and stimulate sector cooperation. Whilst Korea is currently the EU\u2019s eighth largest trade partner, the EU has also become Korea\u2019s second largest export destination. We are well aware that everything cannot be described in statistical comparisons. The cover photo is of the palace Gyeongbokgung in Seoul and gives a notion of the country\u2019s historical heritage. Compare this to the Korean KTX-II high-speed trains that today criss- cross the country at speeds of 350 km/h. And did you know that Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world, with more than 99% of inhabitants having Korean ethnicity? We hope you will find many other interesting statistically based facts about Korea and useful comparisons to the European Union and selected EU Member States. We wish you a good and informative read.

        "Foreword 4 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait F ore w ord Statistics Korea produces and manages official statistics in the belief that statistics is at the core of governing a country. Our agency is committed to providing a basis to support designing and monitoring of policies by producing accurate, timely and reliable statistics and promoting public access to statistics for decision making. We are dedicated to making continuous improvements in our work through constant communication with other domestic data producers and statistical cooperation activities with other countries by sharing experiences and best practices in statistical production. In particular, the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Statistics Korea and Eurostat, is expected to contribute to enhancing the current state of Korea\u2019s statistics even further. The Free Trade Agreement between Korea and the EU will promote trade and our closer relationship to the EU. Korea\u2019s role and responsibilities in the world will increase in the coming years; reliable, comparable statistics are crucial to better support our nation\u2019s advancement as a global leader. At this juncture, it is very important to have had the opportunity to publish this statistical report covering the economic, population, trade, environmental and technological aspects of Korea and the EU. We are grateful for the cooperation from all the statistical organisations in Korea that provided internationally comparable statistical data for this project. In particular, we wish to express our heartfelt appreciation to Eurostat\u2019s Director General Walter Radermacher and his staff for their dedicated support to this publication. We hope that it will assist statistical users by serving as a guideline to gain an accurate understanding of the economic and social conditions of Korea and the EU.

        "Introduction 7 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait In trod u ctio n Eu rostat a n d KOST A T This publication presents a comprehensive selection of comparative statistical data on the European Union and the Republic of Korea, offering a broad cross-section of information. In Eurostat, relations with other developed countries outside of the EU take place mainly via bilateral agreements or in international fora such as the UN and OECD. This publication has been produced in the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2010 between Eurostat and Statistics Korea (KOSTAT), aimed at promoting comparability and harmonisation with international standards as well as encouraging an exchange of information and joint publications between the two offices. D ata f or K orea , the EU- 2 7 a n d selected EU M ember S tates The Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the European Union, not with individual EU Member States. However this publication includes a selection of data from individual EU Member States to allow for a more comparative view given the differences in geographical size, population and economic power between the two entities. Therefore, apart from the EU-27 aggregate information, data referring to Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom are also presented. In terms of population, these countries together represent around 63 % of the EU-27 total and close to 70 % of the EU-27 Gross Domestic Product (see Chapter 1 \u2013Economy). Furthermore, the Republic of Korea together with Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom are all members of the G-20 group, a forum that brings together industrialised and developed economies to discuss key issues in the global economy and supply open and constructive input for increased economic stability. In order to give a more complete overview of the positioning of the Republic of Korea to the EU-27, basic statistical indicators for all EU-27 Member States are given following this introduction. S tr u ct u re o f the pu blicatio n Apart from the introductory section, the publication is structured in 10 themes covering economy; demography; health; education; labour market; living conditions and welfare; trade in goods; energy and environment; transport and communication; and science and technology. The statistical data presented in these chapters have been agreed by both Eurostat and KOSTAT. Attempts have been made to include data that are available both for Korea and the European Union, based on the same reference periods and using the same measurement units. Although most figures are based on international statistical concepts ",
        "Introduction 8 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait and definitions, there may be certain discrepancies in the methods used to compile the data; the reader should therefore be particularly attentive to footnotes under the tables/ figures and the methodological information supplied at the end of each individual chapter. D ata so u rces The statistical data for the EU-27 and the individual EU Member States selected here stem from Eurostat\u2019s statistical reference database (Eurobase) and were extracted in April and May 2011. External trade data have mainly been taken from Eurostat\u2019s Foreign Trade database (Comext) and reflect data availability as of mid-May 2011. If a particular reference year was not available at time of the extraction, efforts were made to fill tables or graphs with the most recent year\u2019s data. These exceptions are footnoted. Both Eurobase and Comext databases are updated regularly; therefore, there may be differences between data appearing in this publication and data that is subsequently downloaded. Korean data was supplied by KOSTAT through coordination with various government and non-government organizations involved in the production of official statistics in a decentralized statistical system in May and June 2011. Some data have especially been compiled for this publication by KOSTAT and other data were obtained from other statistical producing agencies, via KOSTAT. O btai n i ng f resh data f rom Eu rostat The most up to date figures for the EU-27 and the individual Member States can be obtained free of charge from Eurostat\u2019s website, Eurobase. There is a code beneath each table or graph in this publication that indicates from where the relevant data can be retrieved, either through Eurobase\u2019s search engine or from the search field of the Eurostat website (www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat \u2014 home page, upper right corner). The latter search mode will also indicate other publications where this data has been used and give links to the relevant metadata. In the PDF version of this publication, the reader is led directly to the freshest data by clicking on the hyper-links beneath the tables and graphs. O btai n i ng f resh data f rom KOST A T KOSIS (KOrea Statistical Information Service), pursuing the objective of a one-stop statistical service, aims to provide nationally approved statistics to the general public by integrating statistics into the database via Internet. Currently, 504 kinds of national statistics from 116 organisations are provided through a web portal (http://www.kosis.kr). For international users, an English language section is available: http://www.kosis.kr/eng/. The most recent data are available from the site above; some can be obtained from the websites of the relevant statistics producing ministries. ",
        "Introduction 9 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait W hat does Eu rostat do ? Eurostat is the European Union\u2019s statistical office, based in Luxembourg. Its purpose is to provide the European Union with statistics at European level that enable comparisons between countries and regions. Eurostat\u2019s main role is to process and publish comparable statistical information at European level with the goal of having a common statistical \u201clanguage\u201d that embraces concepts, methods, structures and technical standards. Eurostat does not collect data at national level. This is done in the EU Member States by their statistical authorities. They verify and analyse national data and send them to Eurostat. Eurostat\u2019s role is to consolidate the data and ensure they are comparable, using harmonised methodology. Eurostat is actually the only provider of statistics at European level and the data published are harmonised as far as possible. The European Statistical System (ESS) is a partnership between Eurostat, national statistical institutes (NSIs) and other national authorities responsible for developing, producing and disseminating statistics. The ESS functions as a network in which Eurostat\u2019s role is to lead the way in harmonising statistics, in close cooperation with national statistical authorities. One of the main tools for promoting harmonised European statistics is the European statistics code of practice ( * ). This has a dual purpose: to raise the quality of official statistics produced and published through the promotion of the best international statistical principles, methods and practices; while at the same time improving trust and confidence in statistical authorities through institutional and organisational changes. The code mirrors international standards, such as the fundamental principles of official statistics adopted in 1994 by the United Nations Statistical Commission ( ** ). The 15 principles of the European code of practice address the institutional environment, statistical processes and statistical outputs. W hat does KOST A T do ? From its beginnings as the Bureau of Statistics (under the Government Information Agency in 1948) during the 1960s, KOSTAT developed into a sub-organisation of the Ministry of the Economic Planning Board, supporting economic development plans. In 1991, KOSTAT became an independent central government agency producing all major statistics in various disciplines, including in the sectors of population, social and economic statistics. As the top-level organisation in the hierarchy of the national statistical system, KOSTAT carries out important functions including the planning and execution of major short- and long-term projects, examining plans to further improve Korea\u2019s statistical system and evaluating the quality of official statistics. In addition, and according to its mandate laid down in the Statistics Act, KOSTAT ensures the adequate infrastructure, reliability, and comparability of official statistics, all the while maintaining constancy in the production of statistics within the decentralised statistical ",
        "Introduction 10 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait system made up of approximately 375 governmental and non-governmental agencies. KOSTAT provides official statistics using a single service available through the national statistics portal (the Korean Statistical Information System \u2013 KOSIS). KOSTAT oversees two sub-organisations, the Statistical Training Institute and the Statistical Research Institute, aimed at improving the capacity of Korea\u2019s professional statistical workforce, enhancing users\u2019 knowledge of statistics and applications, undertaking research projects to meet policy demands, developing new survey methods and carrying out in-depth statistical analysis. In addition to providing statistical data to international organisations, KOSTAT also integrates and manages the statistical data provided by individual statistical agencies and promotes inter-agency cooperation through statistical cooperation agreements with individual countries. Based on its experience of building advanced statistical information systems, KOSTAT also strives to actively involve itself in global statistical capacity building, thereby contributing directly to the international statistical community.

It reflects the total value of all goods and services produced less the value of goods and services used for intermediate consumption in their production. At the level of the EU\u201327, the GDP at current prices amounted to EUR 12 257 billion in 2010, up 4.2 % compared to 2009 but still below the level it had in the pre-crisis year 2008 (EUR 12 484 billion). Figure 1.1 displays the long\u2013term development of GDP for the selected EU Member States and Korea (expressed in euro). While most countries displayed a gradual increase up to the year 2008, the years 2008/2009 were marked by the global financial and economic crisis, and variations for Korea and the United Kingdom include exchange rate effects. In 2010, most countries showed clear signs of recovery. The curve of Korea is also marked by the 2009 worldwide crisis: the downturn started earlier than in most EU countries, but recovery in 2010 appeared particularly strong (+ 27 % between 2009 and 2010). More than a decade earlier, Korea\u2019s GDP curve was marked by the Asian financial crisis, that gripped much of Asia in the second half of 1997.

        "1 Economy 16 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Although GDP per capita is not a measurement of the standard of living in an economy, it is often used as such an indicator, on the rationale that all citizens would benefit from their country\u2019s increased economic production. For comparative purposes, the information in this section is based on Purchasing Power Parities, which takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using just exchange rates which may distort the real differences in income. The curves of Figure 1.3 show that a constant increase is generally registered. For the EU-27, 2009 is marked by the wordwide financial and economical crisis, less felt by Korea. In contrast, the Asian financial crisis of 1997 has temporarily affected Korean\u2019s per capita GDP much more.

It appears that \u201cIndustry (incl. energy)\u201d is responsible for one third (33 %) of the Korean total, whereas this share was of 19 % in the EU-27. In contrast, the EU-27 economy is fare more oriented towards services, as \u201cBusiness activities and financial services\u201d take a 29 % share, against 19 % in Korea. Very similar shares are noted for \u201cConstruction\u201d and \u201cTrade, transport and communication services\u201d. The EU\u201327 picture however masks particularities of the individual EU Member States. Information can be taken from the table which outlines for instance the relative importance of the \u201cIndustry\u201d in Germany (share of 24 %) or that of \u201cConstruction\u201d and \u201cTrade, transport and communication services\u201d in Spain (10 % and 25 %, respectively). A comparison with 1999 at EU-27 level reveals that the importance of \u201cAgriculture, hunting and fishing\u201d is further decreasing (from a 2.4 % share in GVA in 1999 to 1.7 % in 2010). \u201cIndustry\u201d is further losing ground, in general to the benefit of the two services categories.

The importance of the government sector in the economy may be measured in terms of total government revenue and expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Across the EU, the main components of government revenues are taxes and social contributions. Government expenditures mainly consist of the redistribution of income in the form of social transfers in cash or in kind, compensation of government employees and property income paid (of which by far the largest part is made up of interest payments financing public debt). In the EU-27, total government revenue in the \u201ccrisis year\u201d 2009 amounted to 44.1 % of GDP, and expenditure to 51.0 % of GDP. Only in 2000 and 2007, a near balance was registered. Expressed as a share of GDP, government revenues and expenditures in Korea are at a considerably lower level compared to the EU-27. More important, Korea\u2019s government revenues have been over that of expenditures (by a narrow margin in 2003). Only in 2009, in the wake of the worldwide crisis, government expenditures slightly exceeded revenues.

For the former element, Figure 1.9 outlines that, at least at the level of the EU-27, the \u201c3 % deficit rule\u201d was respected up to and including the year 2008. The financial and economic crisis made the EU-27 deficit increase to 6.9 % of its GDP in 2009. In 2010, the deficit was slightly reduced to 6.6 %. Korea registered a general government surplus throughout the period observed; a near balance between revenues and expenditures was noted in 2003.

Its ageing population, in particular, is expected to pose major economic, budgetary and social challenges. It is recalled that EU Member States should ensure their government debt does not exceed 60 % of their national GDP, as stated in the Stability and Growth Pact. The consolidated gross debt are the accumulated debts of the government sector, composed of the central government, the state government, the local government and the social security funds. The relevant curve in Figure 1.13 shows that at EU-27 level, the 60 % criterium has largely been respected; debt was slightly over the 60 % limit for most years, except for 2007, when it fell to 59 % of GDP. The financial and economic crisis has seriously affected the government consolidated debt, as it jumped to 74.7 % of GDP in 2009 and 80.2 % of GDP in 2010. Among the selected EU Member States, the Italian government debt reached 118.4 % of GDP in 2010. In Korea, the government consolidated gross debt remained under 20 % of GDP until 2002. Between 2003 and 2006, it increased to 30 % of GDP where it stabilised until 2009. In that year (latest available for Korea), the government debt increased to 33.8 %.

General government deficit/surplus (Percentage of GDP) EU-27: the general government deficit/surplus is defined in the Maastricht Treaty as general government net borrowing/lending according to the European System of Accounts (ESA95). It is the difference between the revenue and the expenditure of the general government sector. The government deficit data related to the EDP (EDP B.9) differs from the deficit according ESA95 (B.9) for the treatment of interest relating to swaps and forward rate agreements. The general government sector comprises the sub-sectors of central government, state government, local government and social security funds. The series are presented as a percentage of GDP and in millions of euro. GDP used as a denominator is the gross domestic product at current market prices. Korea : The net lending (+) or borrowing (-) of the total economy is the sum of the net lending or borrowing of the institutional services.

Interest payable and similar charges Under the terms of the financial instrument agreed between the debtor and the creditor, interest is the amount that the debtor becomes liable to pay to the creditor over a given pe- riod of time without reducing the amount of principal outstanding. The interest receivable and payable on these financial assets and liabilities is determined by applying the relevant rate of interest to the principal outstanding at each point of time throughout the account- ing period (European System of National and Regional Accounts \u2014 ESA 95). General government gross debt (Million EUR, % of GDP) EU-27: Public debt is defined in the Maastricht Treaty as consolidated general government gross debt at nominal value, outstanding at the end of the year. The general government sector comprises central government, state government, local government, and social security funds. The relevant definitions are provided in Council Regulation 3605/93, as amended. Data for the general government sector are consolidated between sub-sectors at the national level. The series are measured in euro and presented as a percentage of GDP. Korea: The Korea\u2019s government debt implies the current determinable obligations that are directly repaid by the general government (central+local) according to the IMF\u2019s GFSM 1986 (cash basis), and it is compiled by including government bond, borrowing, contract authorization, and local government net debt. Gross fixed capital formation consists of resident producers\u00b4 acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed tangible or intangible assets. This covers in particular machinery and equipment, vehicles, dwellings and other buildings for EU-27 and machinery, transportation equipment , buildings, civil engineering and intangible fixed asset investment for Korea. Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs) EU-27: HICPs are designed for international comparisons of consumer price inflation. HICPs are used for the assessment of the inflation convergence criterion as required under Article 121 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the ECB for assessing price stability for monetary policy purposes. The ECB defines price stability on the basis of the annual rate of change of the euro area HICP. HICPs are compiled on the basis of harmonised standards, binding for all Member States. Conceptually, the HICPs are Laspeyres-type price indices and are computed as annual chain-indices allowing for weights changing each year. The common classification for Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices is the COICOP (Classification Of Individual COnsumption by Purpose). A version of this classification (COICOP/HICP) has been specially adapted for the HICPs. Korea: The Korean CPI is computed by using the Laspeyres\u2019 Formula, of which base year prices and weights are those of 2005, the base year. The common classification for CPI is the COICOP for international comparison. The selection of items and computations of weight are derived from the 2005 annual consumption expenditure of more than a one- person household. ",

Very densely populated countries of Europe (over 350 inhabitants per square- kilometre, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Malta) contrast with sparsely populated ones (under 20 inhabitants per square-kilometre, such as Finland \u2014 see also table on the last page of the introduction). Korea\u2019s population density amounted to 488 inhabitants per square-kilometre in 2009, comparable with that of the Netherlands (491 inhabitants per square-kilometre). The age pyramid for the EU-27 shows the classic pattern of a gradually ageing population. Consistently low fertility rates sustained for decades and increasing life expectancy has resulted in a shrinking working age population and a higher proportion of elderly persons; thus increasing the age dependency rates. The ageing process will accelerate in the next decades, as the post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement age. The situation in Korea displays basically similar characteristics. The age dependency rate is still under that of the EU-27, but low levels of fertility have led to a decline in the propor- tion of young people in the total population, in particular the share of 20\u201324 year-olds. The working-age population is expected to drastically decline in the next thirty years. Also, a sex-ratio with a dominance of males can be observed, especially in the younger age groups. ",

Sour c e: Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: tps0000 6 ) and Statistics K orea. The population of the EU-27 is characterised by continued growth. Figure 2.6 shows the annual crude rate of population growth (per 1 000 inhabitants) for EU-27 and Korea between 1998 and 2009. The EU-27 population grew at a higher rate for several years following the turn of the century, slowing down after 2008. However, the population growth is unevenly distributed across the Member States. Looking at the five selected EU-27 Member States, an overall decrease in population is observed in Germany in recent years, whilst the crude rates of population change for the rest of the selected countries are higher than the EU average. The Korean crude rate of population change is quite different from the European pattern: essentially, due to a low birth rate, the period observed shows a consistent decrease in the rate of growth up to year 2004, with a subsequent stabilisation. When looking at the population change by its two components, natural change (the difference between live births and deaths) and net migration( 1 ) (the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants), it can be observed that net migration represents the main determinant of population growth in EU-27. Since 1992 net migration contributes more to population growth than natural change. Conversely, the Korean population growth is far more influenced by natural population change than by net migration. ( 1 ) In the context of \u2018population change\u2019 statistics, Eurostat produces net migration figures by taking the difference between total population change and the natural change; this concept is referred to as \u2018net migration including statistical adjustment\u2019.

The difference between the EU-27 and Korea suggested earlier becomes quite obvious here: whereas migration plays the major role in the overall population change of the EU, its role is of minor importance in Korea. In the wake of a declining workforce, there has been a policy change (in 2005) facilitating the attraction of foreign manpower. This has resulted in a higher net migration. A look at the selected individual Member States reveals a number of differences: indeed, migration is influenced by a number of factors, such as the economic situation in the des- tination country, the political and economic situation in the country of origin, and, at least for a number of countries, long-term effects of a colonial past.

The infant mortality rate is a useful indicator of a country\u2019s level of health or development. The infant mortality rate for the EU-27 as a whole has continued to decrease throughout the 1990s: whereas the rate amounted to 10.3 in 1990, it fell to 5.9 in 2 000 and was 4.3 in 2009. The lowest infant mortality rates among the EU Member States were registered in Finland, Sweden and the Czech Republic (between 2.5 and 2.9). Korea\u2019s infant mortality rate compares favourably to that of the EU, standing at 3.2 in 2009, an exceptionally low value. In 2005, it stood at 4.2. Although data for a longer time series are not available, international sources report a rapid decline of the infant mortality rate since the 1980s. Improved nutrition and health care under Korea\u2019s rapid economic and social growth, a concentration of medical services and a rising trend towards families with one child led to a decrease in infant mortality. 0 1 23 4 5 6 2005 200 6 2007 2008 2009 EU- 2 7 K orea Figures 3.4 and 3.5 compare the main causes of death registered in 2000 and 2008 respec- tively. The situation in 2000 shows both similarities and differences: for both cancer and chronic diseases are the main causes of death, although to a lesser extent in Korea. Ischaemic heart diseases play a minor role in Korea whereas they constitute the 3rd highest cause of death in the EU. Accidents and transport accidents took a relatively heavy toll in Korea, as did diabetes mellitus, with a rate double as high as that of the EU-27. Noticeable changes can be observed for 2008: although cancer and chronic diseases remain the main causes of death, their rate decreased, especially for chronic diseases. Fatalities due to accidents and transport accidents were considerably reduced. A similar development is observed for diabetes mellitus. Intentional self-harm (suicide) showed a high increase in Korea: whereas the standardised death rate was 14.9 in 2000 (EU-27: 11.8), it increased to 25.6 in 2008 (EU-27: 10.1). ",

Whereas there were 663 beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 1998, this decreased to 551 beds in 2009. The number of hospital beds fell in every Member State, except Malta. The largest reductions in the availability of hospital beds were recorded in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Bulgaria. The reduction in hospital bed numbers may reflect, inter alia, economic constraints, increased efficiency through the use of technical resources (for example, imaging equipment), a general shift from inpatient to outpatient operations, and shorter periods spent in hospital following an operation. The opposite development is noted in Korea: in 1990, 233 hospital beds per 100 000 in- habitants were counted; in 1998 this value increased to 389 beds, and in 2009, 829 beds were registered, a value close to the highest value among the individual EU Member States (Germany, with 823 beds). The growth in hospital bed numbers may reflect the progressive increase in number of medical institutions and the rapid rise in elderly care facilities, as well as the trend towards large-sized hospitals.

        "4 Education 70 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Expenditure on education may help foster economic growth, enhance productivity, contribute to people\u2019s personal and social development, and promote the reduction of social inequalities. The proportion of total financial resources allocated to education is one of the key choices made by governments in each country of the EU. Public expenditure on education consists of current and capital public expenditure on education; it includes government spending on educational institutions (both public and private), education administration as well as subsidies for private entities (students/ households and other private entities). Education accounts for a significant proportion of public expenditure in all of the EU Member States \u2013 the most important budget item being expenditure on staff. The cost of teaching increases significantly as a child moves through the education system, with expenditure per pupil/student considerably higher in universities than in primary schools. Although tertiary education costs more per head, the highest proportion of total education spending is dedicated to secondary education systems, as these teach a larger share of the total number of pupils/students. Public expenditure on education in the EU-27 in 2007 was equivalent to 5.1 % of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), slightly higher than in 1999 (4.9 %). The highest public spending on education was observed in Denmark (7.8 % of GDP). Cyprus, Sweden and Malta also recorded relatively high proportions (between 6 and 8 %). Most Member States reported that public expenditure on education accounted for between 4 % and 6 % of their GDP. It should be noted that GDP growth can mask significant increases that have been made in terms of education spending over the last decade within some Member States. Furthermore, declining birth rates in many countries result in reduced school age populations, which will in turn have an effect on expenditure. Between 1997 and 2008, Korea\u2019s expenditure on education fluctuated between 4.1 % and 4.8 % of GDP. In 2008, the share amounted to 4.8 %, a percentage similar to that of the Czech Republic and Italy. When expressed as a percentage of total public expenditure, the value for the individual countries in 2008 ranged from 17.4 % and 15.0 % in Cyprus and Denmark, down to values around 9 % for Italy and Luxembourg.

Generally, the public sector funds education either by bearing directly the expenses of educational institutions or by supporting students and their families with scholarships and public loans. Expenditure on educational institutions from private sources comprises: school fees; materials; transport to school (if organised by the school); meals (if provided by the school); boarding fees, and expenditure by employers on initial vocational training. Looking at the shares of public and private sources of funding, the difference between the EU-27 (and the selected Member States) and Korea becomes obvious: for the EU-27 in 2008, public funding was responsible for 86 % of total funding for education, the remaining 14 % came from private sources. Differences are observed among the selected EU Member States: whereas in Italy and France, the share of private source funding did not exceed 10 % (both in 1999 and 2007), this share is noticeably higher in Germany, Spain and especially in the United Kingdom (30.5 % in 2008). Moreover, the share of private source funding in 2008 decreased in Germany and Spain compared to 1999, whereas it increased for the United Kingdom. The public sources /private sources funding of education in Korea has a 60/40 proportion. This is mainly due to the Korean higher education institutions which are traditionally privately funded. But there has been a significant shift in the composition of private funding for higher education institutions: the share for private enterprises rose significantly since the early 1990s, while the burden for households was further reduced. Still, according to OECD sources, public funding per student has at least doubled in Korea since the early 1990s.

Differences can be considerable when comparing the ratios of 2009: in primary education for instance (ISCED 1), the pupil-teacher ratio for Italy amounts to an average of 10.7, whereas it is 19.7 in France and 19.9 in the United Kingdom. At the level of ISCED 2 and 3, the differences are less evident, but nonetheless noticeable. Korea has a pupil-teacher ratio of 22.5 in ISCED 1, 19.9 in ISCED 2 and 16.7 in ISCED 3.

Some of the reasons are the demographic changes in the countries observed. Within one decade, the pupil-teacher ratio declined in most countries, especially in primary education (ISCED 1). Compared to the selected EU countries, the average class size (total number of pupils divided by the total number of classes) in Korea is clearly higher. At the level of primary education (ISCED 1) in 2008, the values in the selected EU countries ranged between 14.5 in Lithuania and 24.6 in the United Kingdom. Most EU countries for which data are available reported values around 20. In Korea, the average class size was of 30 pupils. In lower secondary education (ISCED 2), class sizes are generally bigger (but not in the United Kingdom), ranging from 17.1 in Latvia to 24.7 in Germany in 2008.

The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training, adopted in May 2009, sets a number of benchmarks, including one for tertiary education, namely that by 2020 the share of 30 to 34-year-olds with tertiary educational attainment should be at least 40 %. Just under one third (32.3 %) of the population aged 30 to 34 in the EU-27 had attained tertiary education in 2009, rising to over one third (35.7 %) among women, and falling to 28.9 % among men. In Ireland and Denmark, the overall proportion was approaching 50 % and for women it went beyond this threshold. In contrast, less than 20 % of the population in this age range had tertiary education in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Italy. When comparing the 2009 figures with those of 2000, a noticeable rise can be noted, especially among women. The 2009 percentages reported by Korea are higher by a considerable margin, (apart from showing only a marginal gender gap): 60 % of the total population aged 30 to 34 had tertiary education, women scoring only marginally lower (58.3 %) than men (61.6 %). The improvement of the educational system becomes particularly obvious when comparing the 2009 percentages with those of roughly a decade ago: in 2000, the overall proportion amounted to 34.5 %, with a very clear gender gap (women 27.4 %, men 41.3 %).

Generally, the public sector funds education either by bearing directly the current and capital expenses of educational institutions, or by supporting students and their families with scholarships and public loans, as well as by transferring public subsidies for educational activities to private firms or non-profit organisations. All these transac- tions together are reported as total public expenditure on education. Korea: This indicator is defined as total public expenditure on education, expressed as a percentage of GDP. Total public expenditure is defined as current as well as capital expend- iture of all levels of governance. Total public expenditure includes: final consumption ex- penditure of government services, property income paid, subsidies, other current transfers paid, increase in stocks, gross fixed capital formation, purchases of land (net), purchases of intangible assets (net), net capital transfers paid. Expenditure for all levels of education combined encompasses the expenditure for all programmes from pre-primary level of education ISCED 0 to ISCED 6 (International Standard Classification of Education). Moreover, it includes the expenditure reported in the UOE data collection (UNESCO-UIS/OECD/EUROSTAT) on education statistics that could not be allocated by level. Expenditure on educational institutions from private sources comprises school fees; ma- terials such as textbooks and teaching equipment; transport to school (if organised by the school); meals (if provided by the school); boarding fees; and expenditure by employers on initial vocational training. Expenditure on educational institutions from public sources corresponds to direct ex- penditure on educational institutions from public sources. It may take one of two forms: (cid:116)(cid:1) purchases of educational resources by the government agency itself to be used by educational institutions (e.g. direct payments of teachers\u2019 salaries by a central or regional education ministry); (cid:116)(cid:1) payments by the government agency to educational institutions that have the sole responsibility for purchasing educational resources (e.g. a government appropria- tion or block grant to a university, which the university then uses to compensate staff and to buy other resources). Direct expenditure by a government agency does not include tuition payments received from students (or the families) enrolled in public schools under that agency\u2019s jurisdiction, even if the tuition payments flow, in the first instance, to the government agency rather than to the institution in question.

        "4 Education 80 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait The pupil-teacher ratio is calculated by dividing the number of full-time equivalent pupils by the number of full-time equivalent teachers teaching at ISCED level 1-3. Only teachers in service (including special education teachers) are taken into account. The pupil/student- teacher ratio should not be confused with average class size as it does not take into account special cases, like the small size of groups of special needs pupils, specialised/minority subject areas, or the difference between the number of hours of teaching provided by teachers and the number of hours of instruction prescribed for pupils, for example in the case of a teacher working in a shifts system. Average class size is the total number of pupils divided by the total number of classes. Stu- dents attending special needs programmes are normally excluded from this data collection in order to ensure comparability between countries. In Korea, at primary and secondary education levels, class size is computed on the basis of the division concept. A \u201cdivision\u201d, often commonly referred to as a \u201cclass\u201d, is made up of students who are following a com- mon course of study. Pupils/students are grouped together in a \u201cdivision\u201d based on the highest number of common courses, usually the compulsory studies. A \u201cdivision\u201d is the pedagogical structure in which each student is registered. Regardless of his level of study a student is registered in only one division.

        "5 Labour market 84 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait The activity rate represents the proportion of the labour force population to the population of working age. The activity rate should not, however, be confused with the employment rate, which denotes the labour force in employment against the population of working age. This section looks at the activity rate. The international definition uses the age range of 15 to 64, which in some cases might slightly distort the results as in many countries education is compulsory beyond the age of 15. Figure 5.1 shows the activity rates for three age groups in 2010. The 15-24 age group will obviously display the lowest values, as many might still be in education. At EU-27 level, the activity rate for this age group was an average of 43.0 %; the selected EU Member States showed considerable variations: Italy registered an activity rate of 28.4 %, with the United Kingdom at the other end of the scale with a rate of 59.2 %. Korea\u2019s activity rate for the 15- 24 age group was 25.5 % in 2010, reflecting the importance of education in Korea. The 25-54 age group is the core category, and here variations are far less marked. At the EU-27 level, an average of 84.9 % were active. Among the Member States observed, Italy registered an activity rate of 76.9 %, a value close to that registered in Korea (76.4 %). In contrast, the activity rate for the 55-64 age group was relatively high in Korea, 62.7 %, compared to 49.7 % in the EU-27. Germany clearly exceeded the EU-27 average with a rate of 62.5 %. Figures 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 outline the 2010 activity rates of the three age ranges, making a distinction by gender. For the 15-to-24 year olds in the EU, the rates for men consistently exceed those for women. The opposite situation exists in Korea, where we can see a 10 percentage point separating the sexes. This situation changes in the next age range (the 25-to-54 year olds), where the rate of men is even higher. Hence, the Korean gender gap appears to be clearly greater than that of the EU-27. The Korean activity rates, on the other hand, are similar to those of Italy. For the 55-64 age group, the activity rate of men in Korea (77.7 %) is noticeably higher than in the EU-27 (58.9 %). For women, the difference is less evident (48.1 % in Korea against 41.1 % for the EU-27).

        "5 Labour market 86 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait The employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons in employment, aged 15 to 64, by the total population of the same age group. Again three distinct age groups are observed. The total employment rate for people aged 15-64 in the EU-27 has been rising steadily over the last decade. A rate of 65.8 % was reached in 2008, but fell to 64.5 % in 2009 and then further to 64.1 % in 2010 (data not shown). Looking at the situation with the different age groups in 2010 reveals that the employment rate was low for the 15-24 age range as many of those young people were still in education. At the EU-27 level, the rate was 34.1 %, against 23.0 % in Korea. Among the selected EU countries, only Italy has a lower rate (20.5 %). In the core age group, the 25-54, differences were expectedly less striking: the EU-27, for instance, has a higher rate than that of Korea (77.6 % against 73.8 %). Germany and France recorded rates of over 80 %. For the 55-64 age group, employment rates drop quite sharply, especially in France and Italy. Germany and the United Kingdom reached the rates of 57.7 and 57.1 % respectively, which are well over the EU-27 average (46.3 %). Korea\u2019s employment rate for the 55-to-64- year-olds, however, is even higher, at 60.9 %. In general, the male employment rates exceed those of women in the EU-27. Only in the Baltic Member States and Finland are gender rates roughly comparable. In the southern Member States, the differences are greater. This is particularly obvious when looking at the age groups of 25-54 and 55-64 in Italy, where the gender gap reaches 25 percentage points (pp) and 21 pp respectively. In Korea, the employment rate of 15 to 24 year old women exceed that of men, by close to 10 pp (largely explained by the mandatory military service of young males), whereas for the other two age ranges the situation is quite different: with a gender gap of 27 pp (25-54) and 28 pp (55-64), the values exceed those of Italy.

At the level of the EU-27, the unemployment rate (both women and men) amounted to 9.7 % in 2010 (2009: 9.0 %). Among the individual Member States, the rates ranged from the low rates of 4.4 % in Austria and 4.5 % in the Netherlands to the high rates of 18.7 % in Latvia and 20.1 % in Spain. Korea\u2019s unemployment rate was low over the past decade: from 4.4 % recorded in 2000, it gradually fell to 3.2 % in 2007 and 2008, to increase again to a level of 3.7 % in 2010. The EU situation appears complex when looking at the gender differences. Indeed, the EU average masks country-specific particularities: whereas these are minor in countries such as Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden, they are considerable in Ireland and Greece. Among the Member States considered, the largest gender gaps were found in Italy (2.1 pp) and the United Kingdom (1.8 pp). In Korea, the gender gap was 0.7 pp: the unemployment rate for men amounted to 4.0 %, that of women to 3.3 %. ",
        "5 Labour market 89 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Youth unemployment rates are generally much higher than the unemployment rates for the other age groups. High youth unemployment rates reflect the difficulties faced by young people in finding jobs. However, this does not necessarily mean that the group of people aged between 15 and 24 is largely unemployed, since many of those young people are studying full-time, and are therefore neither working nor looking for a job (i.e. they are not part of the labour force which is used as the denominator for calculating the unemployment rate). The youth unemployment rate in the EU-27 (21.8 % for men, 20.2 % for women) was around twice as high as the rate for the total population throughout the last decade. Particularly high rates are registered in Spain, whereas in Germany they are relatively low.

        "5 Labour market 90 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Statistics on labour disputes cover stoppages of work caused by labour disputes connected with terms and conditions of employment between employers and employees, or among employees themselves. Stoppages can come as the result of strikes or lockouts, depending on whether the employee or the employer is responsible. In order to facilitate cross-country comparisons, rates per 1 000 employees are calculated. Please note that statistics on labour disputes highly depend on a specific political and economic context and should therefore be interpreted with care. At the level of the EU-27, there was recently a general tendency towards less production time being lost due to labour disputes. In 2002, 79 working days per 1 000 employees were lost; this number was gradually reduced to an average of 26 days in 2006. In 2007, however, the number of working lost days increased to 34 per 1 000 workers. Highly dependant on national particularities, labour disputes may cause significant productivity losses in certain countries during certain years. In Korea, a general downward trend was observed.

Inequality in pay between men and women remains high in Europe. Moreover, the impact of pay gaps can be far-reaching, as lower pay increases the risk of financial dependence, not only during working life, but it also implies lower pensions and, thus, an increased risk of poverty during old age. The unadjusted gender pay gap is an important indicator used to monitor imbalances in wages between men and women. It indicates the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees and of female paid employees represented as a percentage of the average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees. Looking at the whole economy, in 2009 women\u2019s average gross earnings per hour were 17 % less than those of men in the EU-27. The reasons for the existence and the size of the gender pay gap are diverse and may differ strongly among Member States, e.g. according to the type of jobs held by women, the attitudes to and the consequences of breaks in career or part-time work due to childbearing and the decisions in favour of family life, etc. The gap ranged from about 3 % for Slovenia to above 30 % for Estonia. The gender pay gap for Italy (6 %) was also among the lowest in the EU. At 35 %, the gender pay gap in Korea has remained high in recent years . ",

The definition of unemployment is further precised in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1897/2000. The economically active population (labour force) comprises employed and unemployed persons. Employed persons are persons aged 15 and over who performed work, even for just one hour per week (except for less than 18 hours a week as a unpaid family worker for Korea), for pay, profit or family gain during the reference week or were not at work but had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent because of, for instance, illness, holidays, industrial dispute, education or training. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 for EU-27 and aged 15 and over for Korea, who were without work during the reference week, were currently available for work and were either actively seeking work in the past four weeks or had already found a job to start within the next three months for EU-27 and within a month for Korea. Activity rates show the active population, i.e. the sum of the employed and the unemployed, as a percentage of the population of the same age. Total employment (resident population concept - LFS) EU-27: Employment (LFS concept) covers persons aged 15 years and over (16 and over in Italy, Spain and UK; 15-74 years in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Romania, Finland, Sweden and Norway) who, during the reference week, performed work, even for just one hour a week, for pay, profit or family gain, or were not at work (temporarily absent from work) but had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, for example be- cause of illness, holiday, temporary lay-off, flexible working time arrangements, industrial dispute or education and training. Korea: Employment (EAPS concept) covers persons aged 15 years and over who, during the reference week, performed work, even for just one hour a week (except for less than 18 hours a week as an unpaid family worker), for pay, profit or family gain, or were not at work (temporarily absent from work) but had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, for example because of illness, holiday, temporary lay-off, flexible working time ar- rangements, industrial dispute or education and training.

A labour dispute is a state of disagreement over a particular issue, or a group of issues, over which there is a conflict between workers and employers, or about which grievance is expressed by workers or employers, or about which workers or employers support other workers or employers in their demands or grievances. Number of working days lost per 1000 workers Normal workdays are those days on which work would usually be carried out by the groups of employees concerned or on which self-employed workers would usually expect to work. Weekly rest-days should therefore be excluded, as well as any public holidays, etc., on which work was not scheduled for the groups of employees involved, or on which the self-employed workers involved would not usually have expected to work. If work is organised in shifts, one shift should be considered as one workday. The normal hours of work for the groups of workers concerned should be defined in accor- dance with the most recent ILO standards.

        "6 Living conditions and welfare 96 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait A general decrease in fertility and an increasing individualization and \u201cnuclearisation\u201d (essentially the moving away from a three-generations household to a two-generations household) has resulted in changing household patterns over the last decades. Based on the 2001 census, one-family households are the most common type of households in the EU. Although no data at EU-27 level are available, the share of these types of households in the selected EU Member States is generally between 60 and 70 %. In the southern EU Member States, this is somewhat higher (Spain: 73 %, Italy: 71 %). In Korea, one-family households constitute 66 % of all households according to the 2005 census; a share equivalent to that registered in France (2010 census data for Korea are available. However, for a better comparability, 2005 census were deemed more appropriate). Two or more family households are quite rare and only make up a few percent of all households. Among the selected Member States, the United Kingdom have the most, with 4 %. Conversely, this type of household is more common in Korea (share of 14 %). Single-person households are the second most important type of households in all individual countries observed. At 36 %, Germany\u2019s share appears particularly high, whereas in Spain it amounted to 20 %, a value similar to that recorded in Korea (19 %). Finally, as for two or more family households, multi person, non-family households remain an exception; among the Member States observed, it was Spain which recorded the highest share (4 %). Looking more closely at the most common type, the one-family households, most are of the \u2018couple with children\u2019 type in Korea, with a share of 65 %. This percentage is not reached in the selected EU Member States observed here; Spain comes closest with 60 %. In Germany most one-family households are of the type \u201ccouple without children\u201d (47 %, against 43 % \u201ccouple with children\u201d). In the United Kingdom, the shares held by \u201ccouple with children\u201d and \u201ccouple without children\u201d is about equal.

        "6 Living conditions and welfare 98 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Comparing the structure of household expenditure between Korea and the EU-27 reveals considerable differences: whereas equivalent shares were spent on \u201cfood and non-alcoholic beverages\u201d, \u201cclothing and footwear\u201d as well as \u201ctransport\u201d, large differences can be observed for expenditure on \u201chousing\u201d and \u201ceducation\u201d. \u201cHousing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels\u201d require an average 10 % of total household expenditure in Korea, whereas in the EU-27, this share is nearly three times as high (28 %). Conversely, expenditure on education is only an average 1 % in the EU-27, explained by the fact that it is largely supplied for free by the state, whereas private involvement in Korean education is traditionally far more important. This explains that an average 11 % of total Korean household expenditure is dedicated to education. Expenditure on health also stands out, as Korea\u2019s share (6 %) is double that of the EU-27. The variations in expenditure among the selected EU Member States are given in Table 6.1. Notable differences exist between the average household expenditure on \u2018food and non- alcoholic beverages\u2019. The United Kingdom registered a low share (9.9 %) compared to the other countries. Expenditure on \u201chealth\u201d varies as well, reflecting the differences in the national health care systems.

The two figures show the situation for the EU-27 and Korea in 2005 and 2010 respectively. In a society with full equality, every quintile would dispose of a 20 % share of the total income generated. In the EU-27 in 2010, the 20 % lowest incomes (first quintile) generated 4.0 % of the total income, whereas the fifth quintile, the 20 % of the population with the highest incomes, generated 43.2 % of the total income. Comparing the EU-27 situation with that of Korea, it appears that whereas the third and fourth quintiles are similar, income seems somewhat better distributed in Korea in the first (6.7 %) and fifth quintile (37.8 %). When comparing the 2010 income distribution with that of 2005, differences are marginal for the EU-27 whereas income inequality is increasing in Korea, especially among the population with lowest and highest incomes (first and fifth quintile respectively).

For the EU-27 in 2010 for instance, it shows that the top 20 % of the population (those with the highest equivalised disposable income) received 5.0 times as much of the total income as the bottom 20 % of the population (those with the lowest equivalised disposable income). Among the EU Member States observed, the gap was widest in Spain (6.9). Compared to 2000, most countries recorded an increase in inequality, except for the United Kingdom. The population living \u201cat risk of poverty\u201d is a relative poverty measure, defined as those living in households whose total equivalised income is below 60 per cent of the median national equivalised household income. Figure 6.9 shows that for the EU-27 in 2010, 16.4 % were at risk of poverty. The equivalent value for Korea was 20.5 %. Compared to 2000, the at-risk-of-poverty rate has increased; not only in Korea, but also in Germany and Spain. Conversely, the rate decreased in France and the United Kingdom. Another indicator of income inequality is the Gini coefficient, based on the cumulative share of income accounted for by the summed percentages of the number of individuals, with values ranging between 0 (complete equality) and 100 (complete inequality). For the EU as a whole, the weighted average for 2010 was 30.5. Across Member States, the Gini coefficient varies, from a low of 23.8 in Slovenia to a high of 36.9 in Lithuania. The selected countries given here vary between 29.3 (Germany) and 33.9 (Spain). Compared to 2000, the Gini coefficient has increased in all countries observed, and quite noticeably in Germany.

EU-27: EU-SILC (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non-permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent members) in terms of duration of absence. Korea: Data for Korea have been collected for general households, excluding institutional households (i.e. household of 6 or more persons who have no blood ties, dormitories, social welfare institutions, etc.) A general household is characterised as one of the following: - One-family household - Household consisting of a family and a non-family member(s) - One person household - Household of 5 or less persons who have no blood ties Household expenditure EU-27: Calculations have been made using data on household expenditure by detailed COICOP (Classification of individual consumption by purpose 1998) level expressed in PPS (Table hbs_exp_t121 - Mean consumption expenditure by detailed COICOP level (in PPS)). Korea: Calculations have been made using data on household expenditure by detailed COICOP (Classification of individual consumption by purpose 1998) level - 2005: urban and rural, excluding 1 person household and farm household (urban and rural data since 2003); - 1999, 1994: urban, excluding 1 person household and farm household; - \u201cHousing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels\u201d does not include Imputed rental for housing such as Imputed rental of owner-occupiers, Imputed rental of owner-occupiers. Distribution of income The total disposable income of a household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income information in individual questionnaires is imputed. Disposable household income includes: - All income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings) - Private income from investment and property - Transfers between households - All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions The current definition of the disposable household income excludes imputed rent \u2013 i.e. ",

It also excludes non monetary income components, and thus in particular value of goods produced for own consumption and non-cash employee income except company car. From the 2007 year on, all countries have to supply gross income information. Equivalised disposable income is defined as the household\u2019s total disposable income divided by its equivalent size. In order to establish the equivalent size of the household, a quotient is attributed to each household member (including children) on the basis of the OECD modified scale. A weight of 1.0 is given to the first adult, 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or over who are living in the household, and 0.3 to each child aged less than 14. Income quintile share ratio (S80/S20) is defined as the ratio of total income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income (top quintile) to that received by the 20 % of the population with the lowest income (lowest quintile). EU-27: Income must be understood as equivalised disposable income. EU aggregate figures are calculated as population-weighted averages of national values. Korea: Income must be understood as disposable household income: 1995-2005: urban, excluding 1 person household and farm household; 2006-2010: urban and rural, including 1 person household and farm household. At risk of poverty rate is defined as the percentage of persons with an equivalised disposable income below 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income. EU aggregate figures are calculated as population-weighted averages of national values. The Gini coefficient is defined as the relationship of cumulative shares of the population arranged according to the level of equivalised disposable income, to the cumulative share of the equivalised total disposable income received by them. A society that scores 0 on the Gini scale has perfect equality in income distribution. The higher the number over 0, the higher the inequality, and the score of 100 indicates total inequality where only one person corners all the income. Number of police officers EU-27: In most cases these figures include all ranks of police officers including criminal police, traffic police, border police, gendarmerie, uniformed police, city guard, and municipal police. They exclude civilian staff, customs officers, tax police, military police, secret service police, part-time officers, special duty police reserves, cadets, and court police. The number of police officers per 1 000 inhabitants have been calculated using annual average population (table demo_r_d3avg). Population data was not available for an aggregate \u201cEngland and Wales\u201d. Korea: These figures include all ranks of police officers under the Korea National Police Agency and Korea coast guards. They exclude civilian staff. In 1997 Korea coast guard has been departed from Korea national police Agency as an independent office. The number of police officers per 1 000 inhabitants have been calculated using projection population data. ",

With a limited internal consumer market, it adopted an export-oriented economic strategy and has become a world leader in the export of vehicles and consumer electronics. Figure 7.1 outlines the development of the global trade in goods of Korea between 2000 and 2009: whereas the period 2001-2003 was marked by relative stagnation, the period between 2004 and 2008 saw considerable year-on-year increases in the traded value of goods. This upward trend continued until the year 2009, when the worldwide financial and economic crisis began to take its toll. Throughout the period observed, Korea\u2019s trade balance has been positive, i.e. the total value of goods exported exceeded the value of total imports, except for the year 2008, when the trade balance observed negative values (EUR 9 billion). The following year, despite a generally lower level of imports and exports, a trade surplus was registered again: with EUR 29 billion, the 2009 trade surplus is the highest since 2000. \u2013 50 000 0 50 000 1 00 000 1 50 000 200 000 250 000 300 000 2000 200 1 2002 2003 200 4 2005 200 6 2007 2008 2009 I m p orts Exp orts T rade bala n ce Sour c e: Eu rostat - Co m trade database.

Taking a limited perspective on the trade between the EU-27 and Korea, it appears that the total value of Korean goods imported by the EU-27 is 44 % higher in 2010 compared to 2000. Likewise, the value of EU-27 exports to Korea is 67 % higher. This corresponds to an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of EU-27\u2019s imports and exports between 2000 and 2010 of 3.7 % and 5.3 % respectively. Despite the faster growth of EU-27\u2019s exports to Korea, the value of Korean imports continuously exceeded those of exports by a considerable margin. The EU-27\u2019s trade balance with Korea is hence consistently negative. For the period observed, the lowest trade deficit was recorded in 2002 (EUR 7 billion); the highest in 2006 (EUR 18 billion). In recent years the gap between the value of imports from and exports to Korea has been narrowing: between 2006 and 2010 the value of EU-27 exports to Korea increased by 22 %, whereas that of EU-27 imports from Korea decreased by 5 %.

        "7 Trade in goods 118 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Looking at the individual EU Member States for which Korean goods are destined, it appears that some considerable changes took place between 2000 and 2010. While 22 % of all EU-27 imports in 2000 landed in the United Kingdom, this share decreased to 7 % in 2010. Germany was the main destination country in 2010 (2000: 20 %) taking about a quarter (24 %) of all Korean goods shipped to the EU-27. However, the so-called \u201cRotterdam effect\u201d (or, in this case, the \u201cHamburg effect\u201d) should be considered here: exports to the EU are declared, according to Community rules, by the Member State where these goods are released for free circulation, rather than by the Member State of the final destination. This mismatch occurs due to the importance of large EU ports as transit ports. Poland and Slovakia (the latter especially) have both notably increased their share as importers of Korean goods. For Slovakia, the likely reason for this is a large car assembly plant, in operation since 2006. The EU countries whose products were destined for Korea did not change their exports substantially between 2000 and 2010. Germany and France maintained sizeable contributions; the Netherlands and Ireland increased their exports, whereas the United Kingdom exported less to Korea.

In absolute terms, however, the value of Japanese goods imported by Korea remained at roughly the same level (2000: EUR 34.5 billion; 2009: EUR 35.4 billion) but taking into consideration the overall increase of trade, Japan\u2019s share has decreased. The EU-27\u2019s share of 10 % remain of the same and in 2010 made the European Union the third most important import partner for Korea. The USA lost its leading position as a destination for Korean exports in recent years, with a share of 22 % in 2000 falling to 10 % in 2009. In 2009 China was the most important country for Korean exports, with a share of 24 %. If Hong Kong is added to China\u2019s share, then this figure rises to nearly 30 %. In 2000, the EU-27 was the second most important export partner for Korea after the USA. The same position was registered in 2009 (with the share of 13 %), this time well ahead of the USA and Japan.

With a thriving IT industry, the imports of \u201cOffice and data-processing machinery\u201d have been considerably reduced: whereas it still maintained the third position in 2000 (EUR 8.3 billion, share of 5 % in the total value of imports), it was no longer present in the top 10 ranking of 2009 (value in 2009: EUR 4.6 billion, rank 13). Korea\u2019s main exports include \u201cElectrical machinery\u201d, \u201cRoad vehicles\u201d and \u201cTelecommuni- cation and sound-recording equipment\u201d. These categories are found high in the rankings of both 2000 and 2009. What is surprising is the export category of \u201cPetroleum, petroleum products\u201d, especially considering the fact that it is the main commodity imported. The explanation lies perhaps in the fact that Korea has one of the most advanced oil refinery installations, with substantial capacities (largely exceeding domestic demand) and is thus serving the increasing needs for refined petroleum products of other \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan), China, and more recently also the EU (see table 7.3).

The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is setting binding targets for a number of industrialized countries, including the EU, for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The \u201cKyoto basket\u201d of greenhouse gases includes: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and the so-called F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 )). The aggregated greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in units of CO 2 equivalent. With the exception of Cyprus and Malta, all EU Member States have individual targets under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2009, the greenhouse gas emissions of the EU-15 (i.e. the EU Member States before the two latest enlargements) were 13 % below the level of 1990. The target foresees a reduction by 8 % compared to 1990. The worldwide financial and economic crisis, characterised by lower production volumes (especially in 2009), helped achieve this goal. 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 EU-15 Korea Germany Spain France Italy United Kingdom Sour c e: Eu ropean E n v iron m ent Agenc y (EE A) , Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: en v_ air _ ind) and G reenho u se G as I n v entor y & Research Center of K orea (GI R).

Although a large greenhouse gas emitter, Korea is not among the countries with a mandatory commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Greenhouse gas emissions have increased at a rapid pace over the last 20 years due to an impressive industrial development and a high dependency on fossil fuels. Korea has committed itself to moving away from the traditional \u201cbrown economy\u201d growth-at-any- cost model to a \u201cgreen economy\u201d model where long-term prosperity and sustainability are the key objectives. Korea has announced, in a voluntary and independent manner, that its national mid-term target is to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by between 21 and 30 per cent by 2020 (depending on the scenario), compared to the \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d approach (i.e. continuing current trends in population, economy, technology and human behaviour).

At the level of the EU-27 (not shown for reasons of scaling), gross emissions amounted to a total of 5 192 million tonnes in 1998. The value remained stable until 2006 and decreased in the following years. In 2009, total GHG emissions amounted to 4 615 million tonnes, a decrease of 7 % compared to 2008. Looking at the selected EU Member States, all countries showed a lower value in 2009, except for Spain, where emissions in 2009 were still slightly above the levels of 1998. Due to its very rapid economic development, Korea\u2019s GHG emissions have been rapidly increasing.

The size of the country and the structure of the national economy influence the generation of waste of individual Member States. Countries such as Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Estonia and Finland generate comparatively high amounts of waste, due to the presence of \u201cwaste-intensive\u201d economic activities (such as mining and quarrying or paper and pulp industries). When looking at the selected EU countries, it can be seen that the United Kingdom and Spain have reduced their total amount of waste by 7 % between 2004 and 2008. Conversely, Italy\u2019s, France\u2019s and Germany\u2019s waste generation increased by 28 %, 14 % and 2 % respectively during this period.

The waste produced by households in 2008 ranged from 181 kg per capita in Poland to 577 kg per capita in the Netherlands. Between 2004 and 2008, the annual weight of household waste generation in Korea has been fluctuating between 308 and 321 kg per capita. With a quantity of 317 kg per person in 2008, Korea\u2019s household waste generation may be compared with that of the Czech Republic (305 kg), Finland (315 kg) or Estonia (328 kg). The energy intensity of the economy measures the energy consumption of an economy and its overall energy efficiency. High energy intensities indicate a high price or cost of converting energy into GDP. Many factors influence an economy\u2019s overall energy intensity: standard of living, climate, transportation patterns, economic structure and productivity as well as energy prices. The decoupling of increasing economic activity from increasing energy consumption is a goal for sustainable development. Countries with a large services sector, generating a higher value added, generally display lower energy intensity ratios. The energy intensity of the economy of the EU-27 has been decreasing gradually: from a ratio of 208.96 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) per EUR 1000 of GDP in 1995, it fell to 165.2 kgoe in 2009.

        "8 Energy and environment 132 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Primary energy production in the EU-27 amounted to 812.2 million of tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 2009. This continued the generally downward trend of EU-27 production, as supplies of raw materials became exhausted and/or the exploitation of limited resources became uneconomical. As a result of the shortfall between production and consumption, the EU is increasingly dependent on energy imports from non-member countries. In 2009, more than half (54 %) of the EU\u2019s gross energy consumption came from imported sources. Production was dominated by the United Kingdom with a 19.2 % share of the EU-27 total, (although this is a considerable reduction when compared with a decade earlier, when the UK still held a 29 % share). Germany and France (production of 128 million toe and 129 million toe respectively), both held shares of around 16 % of the EU-27 total. Primary energy production is spread across a range of different energy sources: nuclear energy (29 % of the total at EU level); solid fuels (21 %); and natural gas (20 %). The remainder is made up of renewable energy sources (17 %) and crude oil (13 %). With poor indigenous energy resources, Korea has to rely almost entirely on imports to meet its energy needs. Korean energy resources are limited to anthracite which accounts for only a fraction of total primary energy supply. Although the indexed curve of primary energy production shows an upward trend, it should be kept in mind that the production figures remain low in absolute terms. From 27.1 million tonnes of equivalent (toe) in 1998, primary production gradually increased to reach 44.3 million toe in 2009.

The EU dependency on energy imports, particularly of oil, coal and, more recently, gas, forms the backdrop for policy concerns relating to the security of energy supplies. In 1998, the EU-27 still managed to cover more than half of its energy needs through its own energy resources. By 2009, the energy dependency had increased, as 53.9 % of its needs had to be covered by imports from non-member countries. At Member State level, the picture varies; whereas Denmark was the only country to be completely independent (due to its oil and natural gas resources in the North Sea), the dependency rates varied between 21 % in Estonia and 27 % in the United Kingdom, to 97 % in Cyprus and 100 % in Malta. In 1998 the United Kingdom was still a net energy exporter, but as of 2004, it has become a net importer. With few energy resources, Korea is highly dependent on energy imports. The country is one of the largest importers of oil and gas which both arrive in large tankers, as no cross- border pipelines exist. Korea\u2019s energy dependency slightly decreased from 85 % in 1998 to 82 % in 2009. \u2013 20 0 20 4 0 6 0 80 1 00 K orea EU- 27 G er m an y Spain F rance I ta l y U nited K ingdo m 1998 200 9 ",

In the EU-27 in 2009, this energy consumption was equivalent to just under two thirds (65 %) of gross inland consumption, at 1 114 million toe. Almost one fifth (19 %) of the EU-27\u2019s final energy consumption was accounted for by Germany, whereas France and the United Kingdom were responsible for around 14 % and 12 % of the total. Final energy consumption of the EU-27 has slightly decreased over the decade observed; in 2009 it was -0.1 % lower than in 1998, contrasting sharply with final energy consumption in Korea, where a 39 % increase was observed over the same period. The EU has launched a number of initiatives which aim to reduce energy demand. Several instruments and implementing measures exist in this field, including more efficient energy generation (for example, simultaneously producing both heat and electricity in a single process or unit, improving the energy performance of buildings (whether private or public buildings), and energy labelling of domestic appliances). Korea has launched the Green Growth Korea initiative, where similar measures have been incorporated. See also www.greengrowth.go.kr.

Spain more than doubled (+103 %) its final electricity consumption over the same period. 1990 2000 2005 2008 2009 Share in EU-27, 2009 (%) Korea 94 384 263 122 357 627 408 042 414 690 EU-27 2 150 328 2 517 805 2 769 624 2 860 768 2 718 922 100.0 G er m an y 455 079 483 453 520 954 525 549 495 573 18.2 Spain 125 799 188 459 242 222 268 731 255 368 9.4 F rance 302 230 384 903 422 771 433 481 423 439 15.6 I ta l y 214 627 272 975 300 880 309 317 290 016 10.7 U nited K ingdo m 274 432 329 420 348 676 341 853 322 417 11.9 Figure 8.13 shows the indexed development of final electricity consumption in the EU-27 and Korea. It can be seen that the EU-27 gradually increased consumption to reach a level 26 % higher in 2009 than that of 1990. However, Korea\u2019s final energy consumption increased by 339 % over the same period. There was only a temporary halt during the Asian financial crisis. When related to the population, the final energy consumption of the EU-27 increased by 19 % between 1990 and 2009. Spain\u2019s final electricity consumption increased particularly fast (to reach 5 563 kWh per inhabitant in 2009, an 82 % increase compared to 1990), a level now close to the EU-27 average (5 433 kWh per inhabitant). Korea\u2019s electricity consumption per inhabitant increased from 2 202 kWh in 1990 to 8 507 kWh in 2009 (+286 %). ",

Electricity generation from renewable sources includes generation from hydro plants (excluding pumping), wind, solar, geothermal, and electricity from biomass/waste. The EU has set indicative targets for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources: according to these, 21 % of the EU\u2019s gross electricity consumption should be sourced from renewables by 2010. In 2009, 18.2 % had been achieved at EU-27 level. In Austria and Sweden, the share is more than half (62 % and 55 % respectively). A number of EU Member States had already reached their indicative targets for 2010 by 2008; others are within close reach. Among the selected EU Member States, Germany made the most spectacular progress, from a share of 3.5 % in 1990 to 16.2 % in 2009. The Korean share dropped from 4.5 % in 1990 to 1.2 % in 2009. In Korea, most renewable energy production is assured through hydro power. And although efforts have been made to promote solar and wind power, the effects of the thriving economy continue to drive up electricity consumption.

It presents total annual emissions in relation to \u201cKyoto base year\u201d. In general, the base year is 1990 for the non-fluorinated gases and 1995 for the fluorinated gases. The \u201cKyoto basket\u201d of greenhouse gases includes: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and the so-called F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 )). These gases are aggregated into a single unit using gas-specific global warming potential (GWP) factors. The aggregated greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in units of CO 2 equivalents. The indicator does not include emissions and removals related to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), nor does it include emissions from international aviation and international maritime transport. CO 2 emissions from biomass with energy recovery are reported as a Memorandum item, according to UNFCCC Guidelines, and are not included in national greenhouse gas totals. With the exception of Cyprus and Malta, all Member States have individual targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU-15 agreed (Council Decision 2002/358/EC) to a collective 8 % reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2008-12. This agreement sets the contribution of each individual EU-15 Member State towards reaching the common EU Kyoto target. Eastern European Member States have individual targets under the Kyoto Protocol, with reduction requirements ranging from 6 % to 8 %. Korea: This indicator shows trends in total man-made emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by Montreal Protocol.

Waste generated by households EU-27: Calculations were made using annual average population data Korea: Calculations are based on estimated population data as of July 1 st . Energy intensity of the economy is the ratio between the gross inland consumption of energy and the gross domestic product (GDP) for a given calendar year. It measures the energy consumption of an economy and its overall energy efficiency. The gross inland con- sumption of energy is calculated as the sum of the gross inland consumption of five energy types: coal, electricity, oil, natural gas and renewable energy sources. The GDP figures are taken at chain linked volumes with reference year 2000 for EU-27 and year 2005 for Korea. The energy intensity ratio is determined by dividing the gross inland consumption by the GDP. Since gross inland consumption is measured in kgoe (kilogram of oil equivalent) and GDP in 1 000 EUR, this ratio is measured in kg of oil equivalent per 1 000 EUR. Primary energy production is any kind of extraction of energy products from natural sources to a usable form. Primary production takes place when the natural sources are exploited, for example in coal mines, crude oil fields, hydro power plants or fabrication of biofuels. Transformation of energy from one form to another, like electricity or heat gener- ation in thermal power plants or coke production in coke ovens, is not primary production. Energy dependence rate shows the extent to which an economy relies upon imports in or- der to meet its energy needs. The indicator is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross inland energy consumption plus bunkers. Negative dependency rate indicates a net exporter country. Positive values over 100 % indi- cate stocks build-up during the reference year. Final energy consumption includes all energy delivered to the final consumer\u2019s door (in the industry, transport, households and other sectors) for all energy uses. It excludes de- liveries for transformation and/or own use of the energy producing industries, as well as network losses. Final electricity consumption is the sum of electricity consumed in industry, transport, agriculture, commercial/public services and residential sectors. It covers all industrial sec- tors with the exception of the energy sector, like power stations, oil refineries, coke ovens and all other installations transforming energy products into another form. Final elec- tricity consumption in transport covers mainly the consumption by railways and electri- fied urban transport systems. Final electricity consumption in households/services covers quantities consumed by private households, small-scale industry, crafts, commerce, ad- ministrative bodies, services with the exception of transportation, agriculture and fishing.

        "9 Transport and communication 146 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait The ability to move goods to markets safely, quickly and cost-efficiently is important for international trade, national distributive trades, and economic development. The rapid increase in global trade (up to the onset of the financial and economic crisis) and the deepening integration of the enlarged EU, alongside a range of economic practices (including the concentration of production in fewer sites to reap economies of scale, delocalisation, and just-in-time deliveries), may account for the relatively fast growth of freight transport within the EU. In contrast, strains on transport infrastructure (congestion and delays) coupled with constraints over technical standards, interoperability and governance issues may slow down developments within the freight transport sector. Total inland freight transport (using road, rail and inland waterways) in the EU-27 was 2 469 billion tkm in 2008; it dropped to 2182 billion tkm in 2009 (\u201312 %), essentially as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown. All EU countries show a sensible drop in the volumes forwarded. Preliminary 2010 figures show signs of recovery, however, still far from the pre-crisis level. In 2009, the volume of inland freight transported by road was close to five times as high as the volume transported by rail (17 % of inland freight transported in the EU-27 in 2008), while the remainder (6 %) was carried along inland waterways. Considerable volumes of freight may be transported by maritime freight services (especially in the case of Korea) and for some product groups by air transport or by pipelines (not considered here). Inland waterways play an important role in certain countries of the EU, especially in the Netherlands and Germany. Korea has a network of inland waterways navigable for small vessels only and freight transport does not take place on a significant scale. There are, however, plans to upgrade the network in the future. Korea\u2019s inland freight transport relies mainly on road transport, being responsible for 90 % (on the basis of tonne-kilometers) of the total inland freight volume; the remaining 10 % is carried by rail.

For millions of citizens, daily commuting and travel have become reality. Unlike inland freight transport, inland passenger transport has not decreased much during the 2009 financial and economic crisis. Considering the total passenger transport performance by cars, buses and coaches as well as railways, an estimated 5 701 billion passenger-kilometres (pkm) were recorded at the level of the EU-27 in 2009, a 0.2 % decrease compared to 2008. Passenger cars accounted for nearly 84 % of this type of transport. Buses and coaches took a share of 9.1 %, railways were responsible for 7.1 %. Between 2000 and 2008 there was a marked increase in the use of passenger cars among many of those Member States that joined the EU in 2005 and 2007, in particular Bulgaria and Poland. In contrast, the relative importance of cars as a mode of inland passenger transport fell in many of the \u201colder\u201d Member States. In Korea, the passenger transport performance of railways and buses/coaches is very similar in absolute terms, although recently the passenger transport performance of railways appears to be stagnating. Nevertheless, what is noteworthy is the decrease in the number of pkm performed by passenger cars: whereas still 225 billion pkm were reported in 2000, this value fell to 149 billion pkm in 2009. This decrease is also noticeable in relative terms: in 2009, passenger cars had a share of 56 % in the three transport modes observed, whereas in 2000 the share was as high as 69 %.

Among the EU Member States, Luxembourg recorded the highest passenger car density, with 678 cars per 1 000 inhabitants in 2008, followed by Italy (606). For Luxembourg, the density values may be influenced by company cars (often under leasing contracts) used by cross-border workers. At the other end of the scale, Slovakia and Romania registered the lowest numbers, with 294 and 197 cars per 1 000 inhabitants respectively. Alongside economic growth, car ownership in Korea has increased since the 1970s. The road network has been considerably expanded and improved, and car ownership continued to increase throughout the 1990s and beyond.

These values are increasingly influenced by the number of \u201cpre-paid\u201d subscriptions, that remain \u201cactive\u201d (and are hence counted), although users may have switched to other, more competitive subscriptions in the meantime. Other factors contributing to the high number of subscriptions are mobile phones for \u201cbusiness\u201d communication, used alongside mobile phones for private communication. ",

It covers two categories of transport: for hire and reward and for own account. Both national and international transport is included. National transport is defined as transport between two places (a place of loading/ embarkation and a place of unloading/disembarkation) located in the same country. It may involve transit through a second country. International transport is defined as transport between a place (of loading/embarkation or of unloading/disembarkation) in one country and a place (of loading/embarkation or of unloading/disembarkation) in another country. It may involve transit through one or more additional countries. To avoid double counting, each country only counts the pkm or tkm performed on its territory. Tonne-kilometre (tkm) is defined as a unit of measurement of transported goods which represents the transport of one tonne of goods over a distance of one kilometre. The distance to be covered is the distance actually travelled on the considered infrastructure. Each country reports only the tkm performed on its territory. Inland passenger transport Rail passenger is defined as any person, excluding members of the train crew, who makes a journey by rail. Passengers making a journey solely by railway operated ferry or bus services are excluded. Road passenger is defined as any person who makes a journey by a road vehicle. Drivers of passenger cars, excluding taxi drivers, are counted as passengers. Service staff assigned to buses, motor coaches, trolleybuses, trams and goods road vehicles are not included as passengers. Passenger-kilometre (pkm) is defined as a unit of measurement representing the transport of one passenger over a distance of one kilometre. The distance taken into consideration is the distance actually travelled by the passenger. Each country reports only the pkm performed on its territory. Number of passenger cars is defined as the number of passenger cars per 1 000 inhabitants. A passenger car is a road motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, intended for the carriage of passengers and designed to seat no more than nine persons for EU-27 and ten for Korea (including the driver); the term \u201cpassenger car\u201d, therefore, covers microcars (need no permit to be driven), taxis and hired passenger cars, provided that they have fewer than 10 seats; for EU-27, this category may also include pick-ups.

Investment in the creation of new knowledge is essential for developing new and improved products and processes. One indicator for measuring this is the gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD), expressed as percentage of GDP. One of the key objectives of the EU during the last decade has been to encourage increasing levels of investment, in order to provide a stimulus to the EU\u2019s competitiveness. In 2002 (Barcelona Council), the EU agreed to a target of spending at least 3 % of gross domestic product on research by 2010. This target has also been retained in the EU2020 strategy. None of the five EU Member States observed have attained this objective, although at regional level, certain areas with clustering innovative and high-tech industries do attain high levels (especially located in the nordic countries with values around 5 %). Among the EU Member States observed, the highest expenditure in 2009 was recorded for Germany (2.8 % of GDP) and France (2.2 % of GDP). At EU-27 level , GERD amounted to 2.0 % of GDP in 2009, compared to 1.8 % in 1995. Korean GERD amounted to 3.57 % of GDP in 2009 and has, with a few exceptions, seen an upward trend since the early 1990s. Its current level is among the highest in the OECD countries. The level recorded for the EU-27 in 2009 was reached in 1993. GERD has been over 3 % of GDP ever since 2006 and Korea intends to further increase this percentage. 0.0 0.5 1 .0 1 .5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4 .0 K orea EU- 27 G er m an y Spain F rance I ta l y U nited K ingdo m 199 0 (1 ) 200 9 ",

The number of researchers in the EU-27 has increased in recent years (+35 % since 2000). There were close to 1.6 million researchers (expressed in full-time equivalents \u2013 FTE) employed in the EU-27 in 2009, corresponding to 62 % of the total R&D personnel.

Patents reflect a country\u2019s inventive activity. Patents also show the country\u2019s capacity to exploit knowledge and translate it into potential economic gains. A patent is an intellectual property right for inventions of a technical nature. A patent is valid in a country if it is granted by that country\u2019s national patent office; the validity period is usually 20 years. A patent application to the EPO can be valid in more than one country and at most in all of the Contracting States of the European Patent Convention. The number of patent applications to the European Patent Office (expressed in number of applications per million inhabitants) outlines the impressive growth of Korean applications since the beginning of the 21st century. Since 2007, the Korean ratio has exceeded that of the EU. In 2008 Korean applications to the EPO amounted to 124.4 per million inhabitants, compared to 119.5 for the EU-27. ",
        "1 0 Science and technology 168 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait At country level, the ratios among the EU countries vary considerably and are influenced by the countries\u2019 industrial structures, since different industries have a different propensity to patent. The Nordic Member States (Denmark, Sweden, Finland) and Germany often display ratios between 200 and 300 throughout the period observed whereas the Eastern European Member States often show values under 20. However, it should be noted that the Korean data are underestimated due to the fact that Korean applications will often be addressed to the Korean Intellectual Property Office, but also to other offices such as the USPTO (USA) or JPO (Japan). At a certain extent, this also applies for the European applications. Certain patent applications are filed abroad and may never reach the EPO. Comparability is therefore compromised.

        "1 0 Science and technology 170 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait The so-called triadic patents are of particular importance as these are generally more valuable than patents filed in single countries. A patent is considered as a member of the triadic patent family only if it has been applied for and filed at the European Patent Office (EPO) and at the Japan Patent Office (JPO), and if it has been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Data on patent families are generally less biased, as the \u201chome advantage\u201d disappears to a certain extent. Looking at the triadic patenting activity of the EU-27 and Korea compared to the population size reveals an interesting pattern: the EU-27 ratio shows a gradual increase of triadic patenting activity (with however a less \u201ccreative\u201d phase between 1989 and 1993), culminating in 1998 at 30.1 triadic patent families per million inhabitants. Significant Korean triadic patenting activities are only registered from the early 1990s onwards. From the turn of the century, patenting activities display a noticeable growth, surpassing the number of triadic patenting per million inhabitants of the EU-27. The fact that both curves show a sharp decline is not linked to an \u201cinnovation crisis\u201d but rather to the fact that the USPTO figures refer to \u201cgranted\u201d patents, whereas the EPO and JPO count \u201capplications\u201d. Due to the time lag between application and granting, which may take years, the most recent years cannot be compared with earlier years.

        "1 0 Science and technology 171 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait D e fin itio n s a n d m ethodolo g ical i nf or m atio n Eurostat and Korea statistics on R&D expenditure and personnel are compiled using the guidelines laid out in the Frascati Manual, the \u201cProposed standard practice for surveys of research and experimental development\u201d, which in its latest version was published in 2002, by the OECD. Basic data on R&D personnel are expressed as head count (HC) and full time equivalents (FTE). Total national R&D personnel is obtained by summing up the R&D personnel em- ployed in the four different sectors of performance. The main breakdown of R&D statistics is by four institutional sectors of performance. These four sectors of performance are the business enterprise sector (BES), the govern- ment sector (GOV), the higher education sector (HES) and the private non-profit sector (PNP). Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) is consequently composed of: Business en- terprise expenditure on R&D (BERD), Higher Education expenditure on R&D (HERD), Government expenditure on R&D (GOVERD) and Private Non-profit expenditure on R&D (PNPRD). Intramural expenditures are all expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit or sector of the economy, whatever the source of funds. Expenditures made outside the statistical unit or sector but in support of intramural R&D ( e.g. purchase of sup- plies for R & D) are included. Both current and capital expenditures are included. Gross domestic expenditure on R&D, by source of funds (GERD) is financed respectively by industry, government, the higher education and the private non-profit sector. The fifth source of funds shown, which also make the breakdown complete, is GERD financed from abroad. R&D is an activity where there are significant transfers of resources between units, organisations, sectors and countries. The importance of the source of funding has been recognized in one of the Barcelona targets of the Lisbon agenda where it is said that the appropriate split for R&D is 1/3 financed by public funds and 2/3 by private. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, and in the management of the projects concerned. FTE (Full-time equivalent) corresponds to one year\u2019s work by one person (for example, a person who devotes 40 % of his time to R&D is counted as 0.4 FTE. Patent applications to the European Patent Office (EPO) Data refer to applications filed directly under the European Patent Convention or to applications filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty and designated to the EPO (Euro- PCT). Patent applications are counted according to the year in which they were filed at the EPO and are broken down according to the International Patent Classification (IPC). They are also broken down according to the inventor\u2019s place of residence, using fractional counting if multiple inventors or IPC classes are provided to avoid double counting. ",
        "1 0 Science and technology 172 The European Union and the Republic of Korea \u2014 A statistical portrait Triadic patent families A common approach is to calculate patent indicators based on information (filings, grants, etc.) from a particular patent office. While the richness and strength of those indicators are broadly recognised, they are affected by \u201chome\u201d advantage bias \u2013 where proportionate to their inventive activity, domestic applicants tend to file more patents in their home country compared to foreign applicants. A patent family is a set of patents taken at various offices to protect the same invention. A patent family is triadic when the invention to which it refers has been the subject of a patent application at the European Patent Office (EPO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO), and the subject of the issue of a title of ownership at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In other words, a triadic patent protects an invention on the European, Japanese and U.S. markets simultaneously. ",
