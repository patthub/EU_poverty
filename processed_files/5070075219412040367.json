        "\u2018Greening\u2019 Europe\u2019s economy The themes of energy, the economy and climate change are brought together in a new report from Eurofound, Greening the European economy: Responses and initiatives by Member States and social partners . The findings of the report reflect the extent to which environmental concerns have become a key element of policymaking and illustrate the consensus that exists between trade unions, employers and governments regarding the importance of the \u2018green agenda\u2019. The report shows that across Europe, national governments and the social partners are keen to maximise the job creation potential of this new area, and stimulate economic recovery, reduce carbon dioxide emissions as well as develop alternative energy sources. However, the report goes on to point out that the \u2018green economy\u2019 is not a short-term, quick-fix solution that will help countries emerge rapidly from the economic crisis. Changing Europe\u2019s energy infrastructure, limiting carbon emissions, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness and ensuring that workers\u2019 skills remain up to date, needs careful, long-term planning.

On average, women across the EU in 2008 earned 16.6% less than men. This is despite the explicit gender-neutral terms of European collective agreements and minimum wage laws. A Eurofound report, Pay developments \u2013 2008 , also finds that the gender pay gap is wider in the 12 new EU Member States than in the former EU15. At the two ends of the spectrum are Estonia, where it stands at 30.3%, and Italy, where it is only 4.4%. Other countries in which the pay gap is notably wide (more than 20%) include Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Slovakia.

Against the background of a newly elected Parliament, changes in the make-up of the European Commission, and the recent ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, Eurofound is working hard to continue to fulfil its mandate to deliver relevant, up-to-date findings to decision makers. For example, an information intiative targeting newly returned MEPs is currently underway through Eurofound\u2019s Brussels Liaison Office. Meanwhile, finishing touches are being put to the fourth Foundation Forum, which addresses European responses to the global recession. Foundation Forum 2009 will debate the impact of the recession and discuss the actions that workers, employers and national governments can undertake to weather the storm. Several key Eurofound publications dealing with the theme of recession will also be launched at the Forum \u2013 the 2009 annual report from the European Restructuring Monitor, Restructuring in recession, and the latest resource pack, Sink or swim: Recession and recovery in Europe . New publications this month include a report looking at the \u2018greening\u2019 of the European economy, the latest annual review of working conditions in the EU, and a number of case studies of successful examples of integration of migrants from the \u2018European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants\u2019 (CLIP). Eurofound continues to collaborate proactively with EU Presidency programmes, bringing its research findings to a high-level conference on labour market inclusion in Stockholm this month, as part of the Swedish Presidency. Preparation is also progressing on Eurofound\u2019s contribution to the upcoming Spanish Presidency in 2010. Closer to home, Eurofound is in the middle of an active recruitment drive, with vacancies for a range of positions currently advertised on our home page. Jorma Karppinen Director ISSN 1830-7108 CAT.

EF/09/78/EN Final preparations for Foundation Forum 2009 Europe must find a way of out of recession. But can it do so with its social and political principles intact? Or will some fundamental European values be jettisoned in regaining global competitiveness? These are the questions to be discussed at Foundation Forum 2009, \u2018Global recession: Europe\u2019s way out\u2019. As always, the Irish government\u2019s support is key to the success of the Forum, which takes place in Dublin on 5\u20136 November. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Brian Cowen is invited to open the debate, and ministers from Luxembourg, Slovenia and Poland are speaking in plenary and breakout sessions. High-level representatives of the social partners are attending, with ETUC General Secretary John Monks speaking on the lessons learned from previous recessions. Amy Domini, founder and CEO of Domini Social Investments will share her insights on the \u2018American way out\u2019, while Maria Joao Rodrigues, Special Advisor on the Lisbon Strategy, will present European perspectives on weathering the storm. Restructuring in the construction sector With access to credit severely curtailed, the construction industry is in crisis. A new report from Eurofound, Restructuring in the construction sector , looks at how the sector is coping with the downturn and what measures have been taken to reduce job loss. Many governments have launched large-scale public works aimed at improving infrastructure and simultaneously preserving construction jobs. Some have provided tax breaks to stimulate housing demand, while others have adapted their rules on benefit payments or expanded short-time working schemes. However, such measures have not prevented significant job loss, particularly among lower-skilled, younger, and migrant workers.

But it can be hard to make sense of developments in other Member States without some background knowledge of their industrial relations culture. The \u2018Industrial relations country profiles\u2019 provide, for each country, a concise guide to the basic economic facts and figures, the main trade union and employer bodies, the type and level of collective bargaining, the extent of industrial conflict and more. Complementing this national-level information, the recently updated European industrial relations dictionary provides definitions and contextual information on such uniquely European concepts as \u2018posted workers\u2019 and \u2018direct effect\u2019. Visit www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/country_index.htm for the country profiles and, for the dictionary, www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary . Promoting young people\u2019s inclusion in labour market Policy concern is growing in many Member States about the rising numbers of young people who are entering long-term disability schemes \u2013 in many cases, because of mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders. Eurofound\u2019s research into the issue will feature at an upcoming high-level conference on labour market inclusion hosted by the Swedish Presidency, on 26\u201327 October in Stockholm. Politicians, experts, researchers and stakeholders from across the EU will look at ways of tackling the issue.
