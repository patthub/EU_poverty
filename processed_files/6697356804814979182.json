        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 2 ECOMP.3.C. EN I. INTRODUCTION 1. On 7 June 2018, the Commission presented, based on Articles 173, 182, 183 and 188 TFEU, its proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing Horizon Europe - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination (2021-2027). 2. That proposal merges two current legal acts (the Framework Programme and the Rules for Participation and Dissemination) into one single legal act. 3. A financial envelope for the implementation of the framework programme of \u20ac94.1 billion (in current prices) is envisaged for the 2021-2027 period. In addition, the Commission proposes to contribute another \u20ac3.5 billion from the InvestEU Fund for Horizon Europe, which together with the \u20ac2.4 billion for the Euratom research and training programme, makes a total budget allocation of \u20ac100 billion (\u20ac88.7 billion in constant or 2018 prices) for science, research and innovation related projects. The Defence Fund envelope is \u20ac13 billion. 4. The intention is to have a R&I programme with synergies across the Union's MFF budget. Synergies with other programmes, e.g. the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Digital Europe Programme, Connecting Europe Facility and the Common Agriculture Policy, should enable the pursuit of common objectives. 5. Since Horizon Europe is linked to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), all provisions with budgetary implications are square bracketed (not part of the partial general approach). Synergies linked to financing from various funds are also in brackets. Several provisions of various Articles or Annexes 1 are therefore excluded from the Partial General Approach. 1 Articles 8, 9, 11, 18, 23 and Annex IV. ",
        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 3 ECOMP.3.C. EN 6. The same goes for objectives and broad lines of activities of the European Defence Fund 2 and on provisions concerning third countries associated to Horizon Europe 3 , which are of a horizontal nature and depend on progress in other files. 7. Furthermore, the provisions concerning the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) in Annex 1a are in brackets subject to further negotiations at technical level. 8. The European Parliament has appointed MEP Dan NICA (S&D) as rapporteur on the Framework Programme 4 . The European Parliament's Industry, Research and Energy Committee's vote is expected in November. The European Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion on 17 October 2018 5 , whilst the Committee of the Regions provided its opinion at its 8-10 October Plenary session 6 . II. WORK WITHIN THE COUNCIL 9. In June 2018, the Bulgarian Presidency launched the discussion in the Research Working Party. In the months of June and July, the working party engaged in an exchange of views on the main building blocks (\"packages\") of the two Horizon Europe proposals, as proposed by the Austrian Presidency. In addition, the Presidency gathered both general and specific written comments from delegations. 10. During the above process, the Research Working Party also considered the Commission's impact assessment. In conclusion, delegations recognised that the Commission's impact assessment had no major omissions or factual mistakes. Accordingly, the Working Party proceeded with the examination of the proposals 7 . 2 Article 5. 3 Articles 12, 18 and 19. 4 For the specific programme the appointed rapporteur is MEP Christian EHLER (European People's Party). 5 13758/18 (opinion covers both the Framework Programme and the Specific Programme). 6 13759/18 (opinion covers both the Framework Programme and the Specific Programme). 7 13566/18 ",
        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 4 ECOMP.3.C. EN 11. Based on the material collected during the previous months of deliberations, the Presidency presented at the Working Party on 3 September 2018 a first compromise text. Since the beginning of September, the Working Party examined intensively the continuously updated Presidency compromise texts. 12. The Presidency's compromise text, which has received broad support in the Working Party, is set out in the Annex to the present note. 13. The latest Presidency compromise text was examined at the Research Working Party on 15 November 2018. Based on the discussions, the Presidency has during the meeting introduced further changes that are integrated in the annexed text. Delegations therefore are still scrutinising the text but have already indicated parliamentary (DK) and substantial reservations in various parts of the text. The main outstanding issues are listed below in chapter III. 14. The changes compared to the latest Presidency compromise texts 8 are in the following parts of the text: \u2013 Article 2, definitions 3, 5 , 17, 17a, 31 \u2013 Article 8 (2)a [XX%] \u2013 Article 10 \u2013 Article 18(2) \u2013 Article 20(2) and (3) \u2013 Article 26(4) \u2013 Article 29(3) \u2013 Article 35 \u2013 Article 43 overall and correction of capping in (1) d [XX%] \u2013 Article 46(2) \u2013 Annex I, Pillar II (mirroring the changes in Article 4) \u2013 Annex I, Part 4 \u2013 Annex V, introduction 8 WK 13916/18 and WK 13890/18. ",
        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 5 ECOMP.3.C. EN 15. Malta announced that it will submit a statement on human embryonic stem cell research, which will be supported by Poland . The Commission announced that it will submit a statement on the same issue, as was the case for the current Framework Programme (Declaration 2013/C 373/02). III. MAIN OUTSTANDING ISSUES 16. Overall structure of the Programme: Already the discussion of the Ministers on 28 September 2018 showed that most delegations welcome a splitting of the cluster \"Inclusive and Secure Society\" into a cluster on \"Culture and Inclusive Society\" and a cluster on \"Civil Security for Society\" in Pillar II. Additional splitting of clusters has however proved to be more controversial: while there seems to be wide support for the creation of a separate cluster on Mobility, this does not seem to be the case in respect of an additional cluster on Space. The Presidency therefore proposes to consolidate all space-related activities under one single cluster. Reserves: CZ, EE, ES, FR, EL, HU, IE, IT, LU, LV, MT, PL, PT, SE, SI 17. In Pillar I, \"Excellent Science\", Member States welcomed the continuation of instruments already established under the current Framework Programme. Following discussions at technical level, the Presidency introduced an area of intervention that includes support for researchers to return to their country of origin within and to the Union. Some Member States and the Commission questioned the idea of providing Framework Programme funding for the return of researchers from within the Union. Reserves: BE, DE, DK, FI, FR, NL, SE, UK ",
        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 6 ECOMP.3.C. EN 18. The European Innovation Council (EIC), as a new structure in the Horizon Europe proposal, has been the subject of extensive deliberations at technical level. Member States requested that within the EIC Accelerator, the EIC should not only give blended finance but also grant- only and equity-only support. Taking into account the relevant parts in the Specific Programme 9 , this has been taken up by the Presidency also in the regulation. Questions however remain on the share of the grant-only support within the EIC Accelerator, which some Member States want to limit. The Presidency also suggested several other changes in the text that should address most concerns of the delegations. Reserves: BG, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, HR, EL, HU, IE, IT, LV, NL, PL, PT, RO, SE, SI, SK, UK 19. Parts of Horizon Europe may be implemented through European Partnerships. The Regulation foresees three forms of European Partnerships: co-programmed, co-funded and institutionalised. In the course of the negotiations, Member States stressed that they want to be actively involved in the development and implementation of partnerships from an early stage. While the intention is to set out the areas for potential partnerships in the specific programme at a later stage, the criteria for the selection, implementation, monitoring and evaluation are laid down in Annex III of the annexed text. Upon request by several Member States, the Presidency added a provision limiting the budget share of the European Partnerships in Horizon Europe to a certain percentage (so-called \"capping\"). However, this idea is opposed by a group of Member States and the Commission. Both groups stressed the necessity of further evidence-based discussion before taking further decisions on any possible capping. Reserves: BG, DE, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, HR, EL, HU, IE, IT, LV, MT, NL, PL, PT, SE, SI, UK 9 The Specific Programme, as such, is still subject to final negotiation. ",
        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 7 ECOMP.3.C. EN 20. One part of Horizon Europe will foresee measures for widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area. Several Member States expressed their concerns about the different level of participation in the Framework Programme and requested targeted measures for the strengthening of participation from all across the Union. The Presidency tabled a package proposal 10 that provides additional measures and opportunities for participants from low R&I performing Member States. Reserves: BE, BG, DE, DK, EE, EL,ES, IE, FI, FR, HR, HU, LV, NL, PL, PT, SE, SI, SK IV. CONCLUSION On this basis, the Austrian Presidency invites delegations to endorse the partial general approach as set out in the Annex to the present note. 10 WK 13890/18. This document includes a recital that will be added to the list of recitals at a later stage of the finalisation of the text. ",

        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 76 ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN ANNEX Ia EUROPEAN INSTITUTE OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY (EIT) The following shall apply in the implementation of the programme activities of the EIT: [1. Rationale As the report of the High Level Group on maximising the impact of EU research and innovation (the Lamy High Level Group) clearly states, the way forward is 'to educate for the future and invest in people who will make the change'. In particular, European universities are called to stimulate entrepreneurship, tear down disciplinary borders and institutionalise strong non-disciplinary academia-industry collaborations. According to recent surveys, access to talented people is by far the most important factor influencing the location choices of European founders of start-ups. Entrepreneurship education and training opportunities play a key role in cultivating future innovators and in developing the abilities of existing ones to grow their business to greater levels of success. Access to entrepreneurial talent, together with access to professional services, capital and markets on the EU level, and bringing key innovation actors together around a common goal are key ingredients for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. There is a need to coordinate efforts across the EU.in order to create a critical mass of interconnected EU-wide entrepreneurial clusters and ecosystems, Efforts are still needed to develop ecosystems where researchers, innovators, industries and governments can easily interact. Innovation ecosystems, in fact, still do not work optimally due to a number of reasons such as: \u2013 Interaction among innovation players is still hampered by organizational, regulatory and cultural barriers between them; \u2013 Efforts to strengthen innovation systems lack coordination and a clear focus on specific objectives and impact. To address future challenges, embrace the opportunities of new technologies and contribute to sustainable economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and the well-being of E urope\u2019s citizens, there is the need to further strengthen Europe\u2019s capacity to innovate by: fostering the creation of new environments conducive to collaboration and innovation; strengthening the innovation capabilities of academia and the research sector; supporting a new generation of entrepreneurial people; stimulating the creation and the development of innovative ventures. ",
        "14279/1/18 REV 1 SD/CF/MI/lv 77 ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The nature and scale of the innovation challenges require liaising and mobilising players and resources at European scale, by fostering cross-border collaboration. There is a need to break down silos between disciplines and along value chains and nurture the establishment of a favorable environment for an effective exchange of knowledge and expertise, and for the development and attraction of entrepreneurial talents. 2. Areas of Intervention 2.1. Sustainable innovation ecosystems across Europe In accordance with the EIT regulation and the Strategic Innovation Agenda ,the EIT will play a reinforced role in strengthening sustainable innovation ecosystems across Europe. In particular, the EIT will continue to operate primarily through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the large-scale European partnerships that address specific societal challenges. It will continue to strengthen innovation ecosystems around them, by opening them up and by fostering the integration of research, innovation and education. Furthermore, EIT will contribute to bridge existing gaps in innovation performance across Europe by expanding its Regional Innovation Scheme (EIT RIS). The EIT will work with innovation ecosystems that exhibit high innovation potential based on strategy, thematic alignment and impact, in close synergy with Smart Specialisation Strategies and Platforms. Broad Lines \u2013 Reinforcing the effectiveness of the existing KICs enabling the transition to self- sustainability in the long-term, and setting up new ones in a limited number of thematic areas; \u2013 Accelerating regions towards excellence in countries that are modest or moderate innovators, in close cooperation with relevant structural funds where appropriate.
