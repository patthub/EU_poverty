        "I (Legislative acts) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EU) No 670/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 July 2012 amending Decision No 1639/2006/EC establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) and Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 172, and Article 173(3) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Decision No 1639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) establishes the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) with different types of implementing measures pursued by specific programmes, of which \u2018the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) Policy Support Programme\u2019 provides support for the strengthening of the internal market for ICT products and services and ICT-based products and services, and aims at stimulating innovation through the wider adoption of, and investment in, ICT. (2) Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) lays down the general rules for the granting of Union financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks and creates also the risk-sharing instrument \u2018Loan Guarantee instrument for TEN-Transport (\u201cTEN-T\u201d) projects\u2019. (3) Over the next decade, according to Commission esti\u00ad mates, unprecedented volumes of investment in Europe\u2019s transport, energy, information and communi\u00ad cation networks will be needed in order to contribute to the achievement of the Europe 2020 policy objectives, in particular climate goals and the transition to a resource-efficient low-carbon economy by developing smart, upgraded and fully interconnected infrastructures, and to foster the completion of the internal market. (4) Debt capital market financing is not readily available for infrastructure projects in the Union. The difficulties for infrastructure projects in gaining access to long-term private finance or public funding should not lead to a deterioration in performance on the part of transport, telecommunication and energy systems nor the slowing down of broadband penetration. Due to the fragmen\u00ad tation of the bond markets across the Union, combined with unknown demand as well as the size and complexity of infrastructure projects which require long lead times for project preparation, it is appropriate to address this issue at Union level. (5) Financial instruments, as governed by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 5 ), can, in some cases, improve the efficiency of budget spending and achieve high multiplier effects in terms of attracting private sector financing. This is particularly relevant in the context of difficult access to credit, constraints on public finances, and in view of the need to underpin Europe\u2019s economic recovery.

        "(6) In its resolution of 8 June 2011 on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe, the European Parliament welcomed the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, a risk-sharing mechanism with the EIB providing capped support from the Union budget, that is designed to leverage the Union funds and attract additional interest from private investors for participating in priority projects that are in line with Europe 2020 objectives. In its conclusions of 12 July 2011 on the Single Market Act, the Council recalled that financial instruments need to be assessed in terms of leverage effects in comparison to existing instruments, risks that would be added to government balance sheets and possible crowding out of private institutions. The Commission Communication on a pilot for the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative and the related impact assessment, which draw on a public consultation, should be seen in this context. (7) A pilot phase for the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative should be launched, the aim of which is to help finance priority projects with a clear EU added value, and to facilitate greater private sector involvement in the long- term capital market financing of economically viable projects in the field of transport, energy and ICT infra\u00ad structure. The instrument will benefit projects with similar financing needs and, thanks to synergies between the sectors, should produce greater benefits in terms of market impact, administrative efficiency and resource utilisation. It should provide infrastructure stake\u00ad holders such as financiers, public authorities, infra\u00ad structure managers, construction companies and operators with a coherent instrument and will be driven by market demand. (8) During the pilot phase for the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, the Union budget is to be used along with financing from the EIB in the form of a joint risk- sharing instrument for project bonds issued by project companies. That instrument seeks to mitigate the debt- service risk of a project and the credit risk of bond\u00ad holders to such an extent that capital market participants, such as pension funds, insurance companies and other interested parties, are willing to invest in a larger volume of infrastructure project bonds than would be possible without Union support. (9) In light of the EIB\u2019s long-standing expertise and given that it is the major financier of infrastructure projects and the EU financial body established by the Treaty, the Commission should involve the EIB in the implemen\u00ad tation of the pilot phase. The main terms, conditions and procedures of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds should be laid down by means of this Regulation. More detailed terms and conditions, including risk sharing, remuneration, monitoring and control, should be laid down in a cooperation agreement between the Commission and the EIB. That cooperation agreement should be approved by the Commission and the EIB according to their respective procedures. (10) The pilot phase for the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative should be launched as soon as possible during the current financial framework and implemented without undue delay in order to ascertain whether, and to what extent, such risk-sharing financial instruments offer added value in the area of infrastructure financing and for the development of debt capital market financing of infrastructure projects. (11) The pilot phase should be funded by means of budget redeployment in the 2012 and 2013 budgets from existing transport, energy and telecommunication programmes. For this purpose, it should be possible for up to EUR 200 million to be redeployed for this initiative from the TEN-T budget, up to EUR 20 million from the budget of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and up to EUR 10 million from the TEN-Energy (\u2018TEN-E\u2019) budget. The budgetary funds available limit both the scope of the initiative and the number of projects that can be supported. (12) Budgetary funds should be requested by the EIB on the basis of a range of projects, which the EIB and the Commission deem to be suitable, to be in line with the Union\u2019s long-term policy objectives and likely to be realised. Any such requests and the corresponding budgetary commitments should be made no later than 31 December 2013. Due to the complexity of large infra\u00ad structure projects, it should be possible for the actual approval by the EIB\u2019s Board of Directors to take place at a later date, but no later than 31 December 2014. (13) Application for support, and selection and implemen\u00ad tation of all projects should be subject to Union law, in particular with regard to state aid, and should seek to avoid creating or adding to market distortions. (14) In addition to the reporting requirements under point 49 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 1 ), the Commission should, with the support of the EIB, report every six months during the pilot phase to the European Parliament and the Council after the signature of the cooperation agreement and submit an interim report to the European Parliament and the Council in the second half of 2013. An inde\u00ad pendent full-scale evaluation should be carried out in 2015. EN L 204/2 Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2012 ( 1 ) OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1. ",
        "(15) Drawing upon that independent full-scale evaluation, the Commission should assess the relevance of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative as well as its effectiveness in increasing the volume of investments in priority projects and enhancing the efficiency of Union spending. (16) The pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative should be launched in preparation for the Connecting Europe Facility proposed by the Commission. It is without prejudice to any decisions concerning the Union\u2019s Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) after 2013 and concerning the possible re-use of reflows from financial instruments in the context of the negoti\u00ad ations on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the annual budget of the Union. (17) In order to implement the pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, Decision No 1639/2006/EC and Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 should be amended accordingly. (18) In order for the measures provided for in this Regulation to be effective, in view of the limited duration of the pilot phase, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following its publication, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Amendments to Decision No 1639/2006/EC Decision No 1639/2006/EC is hereby amended as follows: (1) in Article 8, the following paragraph is added: \u20185a. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 5, for projects carried out under the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds referred to in Article 31(2), the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) shall submit an interim report to the European Parliament and the Council in the second half of 2013. An independent full- scale evaluation shall be carried out in 2015. On the basis of that evaluation, the Commission shall assess the relevance of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative and its effectiveness in increasing the volume of investments in priority projects and enhancing the efficiency of Union spending. In the light of that assessment, taking into account all options, the Commission shall consider proposing appropriate regulatory changes, including legis\u00ad lative changes, in particular if the predicted market uptake is not satisfactory or in the event that alternative sources of long-term debt financing become sufficiently available. The interim report referred to in the first subparagraph shall include a list of the projects which have benefited from the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds referred to in Article 31(2a) to (2e), with information on the terms of the bonds issued and the types of current and potential future investors.\u2019; (2) in Article 26(2), point (b) is replaced by the following: \u2018(b) stimulation of innovation through the wider adoption of, and investment in, ICT and broadband;\u2019; (3) Article 31 is amended as follows: (a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: \u20182. The projects referred to in paragraph 1(a) shall aim to promote innovation, technology transfer and the dissemination of new technologies that are ready for market uptake. The Union may award a grant to contribute to the budget of those projects. The Union may, alternatively, make, during a pilot phase in 2012 and 2013, a financial contribution to the EIB towards the provisioning and capital allocation for debt instruments or guarantees to be issued by the EIB from its own resources under the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds.\u2019; (b) the following paragraphs are inserted: \u20182a. The risk-sharing instrument for project bonds referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 is a joint instrument by the Commission and the EIB which provides added value as a Union intervention, addresses sub-optimal investment situations when projects do not receive adequate financing from the market, and provides additionality. It avoids distortion of competition, aims to secure a multiplier effect and aligns interests in the form of a credit enhancement. The risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall: (a) take the form of a debt instrument or a guarantee granted by the EIB with the support of a Union budget contribution in favour of financing provided to projects in the field of ICT and broadband, complementing or attracting financing by Member States or the private sector; (b) mitigate the debt service risk of a project and the credit risk of bond holders; (c) be used only for projects whose financial viability is based on project revenues. 2b. The Union exposure to the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds, including management fees and other eligible costs, shall in no case exceed EN 31.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 204/3 ",
        "the amount of the Union contribution to the risk- sharing instrument for project bonds nor extend beyond the maturity of the underlying portfolio of credit enhancement facilities. There shall be no further liability on the general budget of the Union. The residual risk related to project bond operations shall always be borne by the EIB. 2c. The main terms, conditions and procedures of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds are laid down in Annex IIIa. The detailed terms and conditions for implementing the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds, including risk sharing, remuneration, monitoring and control, shall be laid down in a cooperation agreement between the Commission and the EIB. That cooperation agreement shall be approved by the Commission and the EIB according to their respective procedures. 2d. In 2013, an amount of up to EUR 20 million may be used from the budget allocated for the pursuance of ICT and broadband policy in accordance with the rule set out in point (b) of Annex I. Given the limited duration of the pilot phase, the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds may reuse any revenues received before 31 December 2013 for new debt instruments and guarantees within the same risk- sharing facility and for projects fulfilling the same eligi\u00ad bility criteria in order to maximise the volume of investments supported. In the event that the risk- sharing instrument for project bonds is not extended into the next multiannual financial framework, any remaining funds shall be returned to the revenue side of the general budget of the Union. 2e. In addition to the reporting requirements set out in point 49 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, and without prejudice to any other regulatory reporting requirements, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council every six months during the pilot phase on the performance of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds, including the financial terms and placement of any project bonds issued.\u2019; (4) the following Annex is added: \u2018ANNEX IIIa Main terms, conditions and procedures of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds referred to in Article 31(2c) The EIB shall be a risk-sharing partner and shall manage the Union contribution to the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds on behalf of the Union. More detailed terms and conditions for implementing that instrument, including its monitoring and control, shall be laid down in a cooperation agreement between the Commission and the EIB, taking into account the provisions laid down in this Annex. (a) The EIB facility 1. The risk-sharing instrument for project bonds will be designed for each eligible project as a subordinated facility, in the form of a debt instrument or a contingent (guarantee) facility or both, in order to facilitate the issue of a project bond. 2. Should the EIB be or become a creditor to a project, the EIB\u2019s rights under the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall rank behind the debt service of the senior debt and ahead of equity and any financing related to equity. 3. The facility shall not exceed 20 % of the total amount of the senior debt issued. (b) Budget ICT: 2013: Up to EUR 20 million. The request for transfer of the sums above shall be issued by 31 December 2012 and shall be supported by a forecast of the need for the scheduled Union contribution. If necessary, that forecast may serve as the basis for a demand-based reduction of the 2013 amount which shall be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 46(2). (c) Fiduciary account 1. The EIB shall set up a fiduciary account to hold the Union contribution and revenues resulting from the Union contribution. 2. Given the limited duration of the pilot phase, the interest earned on the fiduciary accounts and other revenues resulting from the Union contribution, such as guarantee premiums, interest and risk margins on sums disbursed by the EIB, shall be added to the resources of the fiduciary account. However, the Commission may decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 46(2), that they are to be returned to the CIP ICT budget line. EN L 204/4 Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2012 ",
        "(d) Use of the Union contribution The Union contribution shall be used by the EIB: 1. towards risk provisioning on a first-loss basis for the subordinated facilities of the eligible project portfolio, in accordance with the relevant rules of the EIB and a risk assessment performed by the EIB under its applicable policies; 2. to cover any non-project-related eligible costs associated with the establishment and administration of the risk- sharing instrument for project bonds, including its evaluation. (e) Risk and revenue sharing The risk-sharing pattern resulting from point (d) shall be reflected in an appropriate sharing between the Union and the EIB of the risk remuneration charged by the EIB to its counterpart in respect of each facility within the project portfolio. (f) Pricing The pricing of the project bond facilities is based upon the risk remuneration in accordance with relevant standard rules and criteria of the EIB. (g) Application procedure Applications for risk coverage under the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be addressed to the EIB in accordance with the EIB\u2019s standard application procedure. (h) Approval procedure The EIB shall carry out risk, financial, technical and legal due diligence and shall decide upon the use of the risk- sharing instrument for project bonds and select the appropriate type of subordinated facility in accordance with its standard rules and criteria, notably EIB Credit Risk Policy Guidelines, and the EIB\u2019s selection criteria in the social, environmental and climate field. (i) Duration 1. The Union contribution to the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be committed no later than 31 December 2013. The actual approval of project bond facilities by the EIB\u2019s Board of Directors shall be finalised by 31 December 2014. 2. In the event of termination of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds during the current multiannual financial framework, any balances on the fiduciary account, other than funds committed and funds needed to cover other eligible costs and expenses, shall be returned to the CIP ICT budget line. 3. Funds allocated to the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be reimbursed to the relevant fiduciary account as facilities expire or are repaid, provided risk coverage remains sufficient. (j) Reporting Annual reporting methods on the implementation of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be agreed between the Commission and the EIB. In addition, the Commission shall, with the support of the EIB, report on implementation every six months to the European Parliament and the Council, starting six months after the signature of the cooperation agreement referred to in Article 31(2c). (k) Monitoring, control and evaluation The Commission shall monitor the implementation of the instrument, including through on-the-spot controls as appropriate, and shall perform verification and controls in line with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (*). The EIB shall manage subordinated facilities in accordance with EIB\u2019s own rules and procedures, including appropriate audit, control and monitoring measures. Furthermore, the EIB\u2019s Board of Directors, on which the Commission and Member States are represented, shall approve each subordinated facility and monitor that the EIB is managed in accordance with its Statute and with the general directives laid down by its Board of Governors. EN 31.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 204/5 ",
        "The Commission and the EIB shall submit an interim report on the functioning of the pilot risk-sharing instrument for project bonds to the European Parliament and the Council in the second half of 2013 with a view to optimising the design of that instrument. A full-scale independent evaluation shall be undertaken in 2015 after approval of the final project bond operations. It shall cover, inter alia, the value added, additionality compared to other Union or Member State instruments and other existing forms of long-term debt financing, the achieved multiplier effect, an assessment of the risks involved as well as the creation or correction of distortive effects, if any. The evaluation shall also cover the impact on projects\u2019 financial viability, volume, terms and costs of bond issuance, the effect on the wider bond markets as well as controlling creditor and procurement aspects. It shall also provide, if possible, a cost comparison with alternative means of project finance including bank loans. During the pilot phase, each selected project shall be assessed. ___________ (*) OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1.\u2019.

The EIB shall set up two fiduciary accounts (one for projects under TEN-T, the other for projects under TEN-E) to hold the Union contributions and revenues resulting from the Union contributions. The fiduciary account for TEN- T may be merged with the fiduciary account set up for the loan guarantee instrument for TEN-T projects, referred to in Annex I, provided such measure does not impede the quality of reporting and monitoring as stipulated under points (j) and (k). 2. Given the limited duration of the pilot phase, the interest earned on the fiduciary accounts and other revenues resulting from the Union contribution, such as guarantee premiums, interest and risk margins on sums disbursed by the EIB, shall be added to the resources of the fiduciary account. However, the Commission may decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2), that they are to be returned to the TEN-T or TEN-E budget lines. (d) Use of the Union contribution The Union contribution shall be used by the EIB: 1. towards risk provisioning on a first-loss basis for the subordinated facilities of the eligible project portfolio, in accordance with the relevant rules of the EIB and a risk assessment performed by the EIB under its applicable policies; 2. to cover any non-project-related eligible costs associated with the establishment and administration of the risk- sharing instrument for project bonds including its evaluation. (e) Risk and revenue sharing The risk-sharing pattern resulting from point (d) shall be reflected in an appropriate sharing between the Union and the EIB of the risk remuneration charged by the EIB to its counterpart in respect of each facility constituting the portfolio. Notwithstanding the provisions applying to risk sharing for the loan guarantee instrument for TEN-T projects, referred to in Annex I, the risk-sharing pattern for project bonds shall also apply to that instrument including the operations of its existing portfolio. (f) Pricing The pricing of the project bond facilities is based upon the risk remuneration in accordance with relevant standard rules and criteria of the EIB. (g) Application procedure Applications for risk coverage under the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be addressed to the EIB in accordance with the EIB\u2019s standard application procedure. (h) Approval procedure The EIB shall carry out risk, financial, technical and legal due diligence and shall decide upon the use of the risk- sharing instrument for project bonds and select the appropriate type of subordinated facility in accordance with its standard rules and criteria, notably EIB Credit Risk Policy Guidelines, and the EIB\u2019s selection criteria in the social, environmental and climate field. (i) Duration 1. The last tranche of the Union contribution to the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be committed no later than 31 December 2013. The actual approval of project bond facilities by the EIB\u2019s Board of Directors shall be finalised no later than 31 December 2014. 2. In the event of termination of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds during the current multiannual financial framework any balances on the fiduciary accounts, other than funds committed and funds needed to cover other eligible costs and expenses, shall be returned to the TEN-T, TEN-E budget lines.

        "3. Funds allocated to the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be reimbursed to the relevant fiduciary account as facilities expire or are repaid provided risk coverage remains sufficient. (j) Reporting Annual reporting methods on the implementation of the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds shall be agreed between the Commission and the EIB. In addition, the Commission shall, with the support of the EIB, report on implementation every six months to the European Parliament and the Council, starting six months after the signature of the cooperation agreement referred to in Article 6(1)(g). (k) Monitoring, control and evaluation The Commission shall monitor the implementation of the instrument, including through on-the-spot controls as appropriate, and shall perform verification and controls in line with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. The EIB shall manage subordinated facilities in accordance with EIB\u2019s own rules and procedures, including appropriate audit, control and monitoring measures. Furthermore, the EIB\u2019s Board of Directors, on which the Commission and Member States are represented, shall approve each subordinated facility and monitor that the EIB is managed in accordance with its Statute and with the general directives laid down by its Board of Governors. The Commission and the EIB shall submit an interim report on the functioning of the pilot risk-sharing instrument for project bonds to the European Parliament and the Council in the second half of 2013 with a view to optimising the design of that instrument. A full-scale independent evaluation shall be undertaken in 2015 after approval of the final project bond operations. It shall cover, inter alia, the value added, additionality compared to other Union or Member State instruments and other existing forms of long-term debt financing, the achieved multiplier effect, an assessment of the risks involved as well as the creation or correction of distortive effects, if any. The evaluation shall also cover the impact on projects\u2019 financial viability, volume, terms and costs of bond issuance, the effect on the wider bond markets as well as controlling creditor and procurement aspects. It shall also provide, if possible, a cost comparison with alternative means of project finance including bank loans. During the pilot phase, each selected project shall be assessed.\u2019.

The 2012 report will also include the EU-EIB Project Bond Initiative. Against this background and considering the short-lived nature of the project bond pilot phase, the Commission wishes to clarify that the expression \u2018report every six months during the pilot phase\u2019 used in recital 14, in Article 1(3)(b), Article 1(4), Article 2(3)(b) and Article 2(7), is that the Commission will inform Council and Parliament by appearing before either institution with suitable support material rather than completing an official Commission report, which would require disproportionate effort compared to the limited scope of the pilot phase.

        "REGULATION (EU) No 671/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 July 2012 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013 THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) New support schemes for farmers within the framework of the common agricultural policy are to apply from 1 January 2014 and are to replace the current schemes. Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agri\u00ad cultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers ( 4 ) should continue to form the basis on which to grant income support for farmers in calendar year 2013. (2) Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 established a system of compulsory, progressive reduction of direct payments (\u2018modulation\u2019) including an exemption of direct payments of up to EUR 5 000 which is to apply until calendar year 2012. As a consequence, the total net amounts of direct payments (\u2018net ceilings\u2019) which may be granted in a Member State, after the application of modulation, have been fixed until calendar year 2012. In order to maintain the amount of direct payments in calendar year 2013 on a level similar to that of 2012, with due account being taken of phasing-in in the new Member States, within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, it is appropriate to establish an adjustment mechanism for calendar year 2013 with an effect equivalent to that of modulation and the net ceilings. Due to the special characteristics of the support in the outermost regions under the common agricultural policy, this adjustment mechanism should not be applied to farmers in those regions. (3) For the smooth functioning of the direct payments to be made by the Member States in respect of applications made in calendar year 2013, it is necessary to extend the net ceilings set for calendar year 2012 to 2013 and to adjust them, where necessary, in particular as regards the increases resulting from the phasing-in of direct payments in the new Member States. (4) In parallel with compulsory modulation, Council Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 378/2007 of 27 March 2007 laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 estab\u00ad lishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers ( 5 ) made it possible for Member States to apply a reduction (\u2018voluntary modu\u00ad lation\u2019) to all amounts of direct payments to be granted in their territory in respect of a given calendar year until calendar year 2012. In order to maintain the amount of direct payments to be made in respect of applications made in calendar year 2013 on a level similar to that of 2012, Member States which made use of voluntary modulation in respect of calendar year 2012 should continue to have the possibility to reduce direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013 and to use the funds generated thereby to finance rural development programmes. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to further reduce the amount of direct payments by applying a system of voluntary adjustment of direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013. Such reduction should be in addition to the compulsory adjustment of direct payment foreseen in respect of calendar year 2013. (5) Where a Member State has applied regionally differ\u00ad entiated voluntary modulation rates in respect of calendar year 2012, it should also have that possibility in respect of calendar year 2013. In order to safeguard the level of direct support to farmers, the combined application of the compulsory and voluntary adjustment of direct payments in calendar year 2013 should not lead to a reduction of direct payment in excess of the reductions applied in 2012, through both compulsory and voluntary modulation. Therefore, the maximum rate of adjustment of direct payments to be applied in respect of calendar year 2013 in each region should not exceed the reductions resulting from both compulsory and voluntary modulation, as applied in respect of calendar year 2012.

( 5 ) OJ L 95, 5.4.2007, p. 1. ",
        "(6) Where a Member State made use of the option provided for in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 by deciding not to apply the maximum rate for the contribution from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to the net amounts resulting from the application of voluntary modulation in the programming period 2007 to 2013, the same option should be made available to that Member State in respect of the funds raised through the voluntary adjustment of direct payments, in order to ensure continuity in the financing of public expenditure of the rural development measures in 2014. For reasons of consistency, the prefinancing arrangements for the rural development programmes should not apply to such funds. (7) According to the phasing-in mechanism provided for in the Act of Accession of 2005, the level of direct payments in Bulgaria and Romania continues to be below the level of direct payments applicable in the other Member States in 2013 after application of the adjustment of payments to farmers in the transitional period. Therefore, the adjustment mechanism should not apply to farmers in Bulgaria and Romania. (8) The new Member States were allowed to grant comple\u00ad mentary national direct payments as a consequence of the phasing-in of direct payments in those Member States. Such possibility will no longer be available in 2013, when the schedule for the gradual introduction of direct payments in the new Member States will be complete. In the new Member States applying the single area payment scheme, the complementary national direct payments have played an important role in supporting the income of farmers in specific sectors. As regards Cyprus, the same can be said of State aids. For that reason, and in order to avoid a sudden and substantial decrease of support in 2013 in those sectors benefiting, until 2012, from complementary national direct payments and, in the case of Cyprus, from State aids, it is appropriate to provide, in those Member States, for the possibility to grant, subject to authorisation by the Commission, transitional national aids to farmers in 2013. In order to ensure the continuity of the level of support to farmers in 2013, only those sectors that benefited, in 2012, from comple\u00ad mentary national direct payments and, in the case of Cyprus, from State aids should be eligible for the transi\u00ad tional national aid, and if that transitional aid is granted, it should be granted under the same conditions as the ones applied to those payments in 2012. (9) The financial transfers to the EAFRD provided for in Articles 134 and 135 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 relate to the 2007-13 multiannual financial framework. The direct payments to be made by the Member States in respect of applications made in calendar year 2013 will have effects in financial year 2014, thereby falling under the next multiannual financial framework. Under that framework, the amounts available for rural development programming already include the amounts corresponding to the financial transfers provided for in Articles 134 and 135 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. Therefore, such financial transfers should be abolished. (10) In order to facilitate the more efficient use of the funds, Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 provided for the possibility for Member States to grant support above their national ceilings up to an amount the level of which ensures that it remains within the margins of the under-execution of the national ceiling. That Regulation provided for those amounts either to be used for the funding of specific support or to be transferred to the EAFRD under Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. As the possibility to grant support above the national ceilings will be abolished when the new direct support system becomes applicable, the financial transfer to the EAFRD provided for in Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should be maintained only until 31 December 2013. (11) The possibility to make the amounts resulting from the application of voluntary adjustment available as an additional Union support under rural development programming and financing under EAFRD for financial year 2014 and the prolongation of the financial transfers provided for in Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should not affect the future adjustment of the level of direct payments with a view to a more equal distribution of direct support among Member States which is foreseen to be part of the new direct support system. (12) In the context of respecting budget discipline, it is necessary to define, for the financial year 2014, the ceiling for the expenditure financed by the EAGF, by taking into account the maximum amounts set in the Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 312(2) of the Treaty and the amounts resulting from the voluntary adjustment, along with the amounts resulting from the application of Article 136 of Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 73/2009 for that financial year. (13) In order to ensure the correct application of the adjustments of direct payments to be made by the Member States in respect of applications made in 2013 and financial discipline for calendar year 2013, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the relevant rules concerning the basis of calculation for reductions to be applied to the farmers by the Member States. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. EN L 204/12 Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2012 ",
        "(14) Under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, Member States had the possibility to decide to use, from the following year, a certain percentage of their national ceiling for specific support for their farmers as well as to review a previous decision by deciding to modify, or put an end to, such support. It is appropriate to provide for an additional review of those decisions with effect for calendar year 2013. (15) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implemen\u00ad tation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the presentation of the amounts resulting from the voluntary adjustment. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers ( 1 ). (16) In respect of fixing the amounts resulting from voluntary adjustment, setting the net balance available for EAGF expenditure in respect of financial year 2014 and auth\u00ad orising the granting of transitional national aids, the Commission should be empowered to adopt imple\u00ad menting acts without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. (17) Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 is hereby amended as follows: (1) Article 8 is amended as follows: (a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: \u20181.

Where necessary, Member States shall make a linear reduction in the amounts of direct payments which are subject to the reduction provided for in Articles 7 and 10 of this Regulation and Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 in respect of any calendar year before 2013 or in Articles 10a and 10b of this Regulation in respect of calendar year 2013, in order to comply with the ceilings set out in Annex IV to this Regulation.\u2019; (b) in paragraph 2, point (d) is deleted; (2) the following Articles are inserted: \u2018Article 10a Adjustment of direct payments in 2013 1.

Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to direct payments granted to farmers in Bulgaria and in Romania and in the French overseas departments, in the Azores and Madeira, in the Canary Islands and in the Aegean Islands. 4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the reduction referred to in that paragraph shall be set at 0 % for new Member States other than Bulgaria and Romania. Article 10b Voluntary adjustment of direct payments in 2013 1.

Voluntary adjustment shall be applied in addition to the adjustment of direct payments provided for in Article 10a of this Regulation. Voluntary adjustment may be regionally differentiated, provided that the Member State has made use of the option provided for in Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 378/2007. 2.

Article 48 Technical Specifications 1. A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. 2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being procured, a procuring entity shall, where appro\u00ad priate: (a) set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and (b) base the technical specifications on international or European standards, where these exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognised national standards or building codes. 3. Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical specifications, a procuring entity shall indicate, where appropriate, that it will consider tenders of equivalent goods or services that demonstrably fulfil the requirements of the procurement by including such words as \u2018or equivalent\u2019 in the tender documentation. 4. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifi\u00ad cations that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intel\u00ad ligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, the entity includes words such as \u2018or equivalent\u2019 in the tender documentation. 5. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation of adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement. 6. Each Party, including its procuring entities, may, in accordance with this Article, prepare, adopt or apply technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or protect the environment. Article 49 Tender Documentation 1. A procuring entity shall provide to suppliers tender docu\u00ad mentation that includes all information necessary to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete description of the issues set out in Appendix VIII of ANNEX 1 to this Agreement. 2. A procuring entity shall promptly provide, on request, the tender documentation to any supplier participating in the procurement and shall reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by a supplier participating in the procurement, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over its competitors in the procurement. 3. Where, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the criteria or requirements set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, or amends a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit in writing all such modi\u00ad fications or amended or re-issued notice or tender documen\u00ad tation: (a) to all suppliers that are participating at the time the information is amended, if known, and in all other cases, in the same manner as the original information; and (b) in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re- submit amended tenders, as appropriate. Article 50 Time Periods A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for suppliers to prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking into account such factors as the nature and complexity EN L 204/34 Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2012 ",
        "of the procurement, the extent of subcontracting anticipated, and the time for transmitting tenders from foreign as well as domestic points where electronic means are not used. Such time-periods, including any extension of the time-periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers. The applicable time periods are set out in Appendix VI of ANNEX 1 to this Agreement. Article 51 Negotiations 1. A Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct negotiations: (a) in the context of procurements in which they have indicated such intent in the notice of intended procurement; or (b) where it appears from the evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notices or tender docu\u00ad mentation. 2. A procuring entity shall: (a) ensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notices or tender documentation; and (b) where negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the remaining suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders. Article 52 Limited Tendering A procuring entity may use limited tendering and may choose not to apply Articles 45 to 47, 49 to 51, 53 and 54 only under the following conditions: (a) where (i) no tenders were submitted, or no suppliers requested participation; (ii) no tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation were submitted; (iii) no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or (iv) the tenders submitted have been collusive; provided that the requirements of the tender documentation are not substantially modified; (b) where the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute goods or services exist because the requirement is a work of art; due to the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or due to the absence of competition for technical reasons; (c) for additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods and services that were not included in the initial procurement where a change of supplier for such additional goods or services: (i) cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services or instal\u00ad lations procured under the initial procurement; and (ii) would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity; (d) in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time using open tendering or selective tendering; (e) for goods purchased on a commodity market; (f) where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development; (g) for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions which only arise in the very short term in the case of unusual disposals such as arising from liquidation, receivership or bankruptcy and not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; and (h) where a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest provided that the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with the principles of this Chapter, and the participants are judged by an independent jury with a view to a design contract being awarded to a winner. Article 53 Electronic Auctions Where a procuring entity intends to conduct a covered procurement using an electronic auction, the entity shall provide each participant, before commencing the electronic auction, with: (a) the automatic evaluation method, including the math\u00ad ematical formula, that is based on the evaluation criteria set out in the tender documentation and that will be used in the automatic ranking or re-ranking during the auction; (b) the results of any initial evaluation of the elements of its tender where the contract is to be awarded on the basis of the most advantageous tender; and (c) any other relevant information relating to the conduct of the auction. Article 54 Treatment of Tenders and Award of Contracts 1. A procuring entity shall receive, open and treat all tenders under procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process, and the confidentiality of tenders. EN 31.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 204/35 ",
        "2. A procuring entity shall not penalise any supplier whose tender is received after the time specified for receiving tenders if the delay is due solely to mishandling on the part of the procuring entity. 3. Where a procuring entity provides a supplier with an opportunity to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers. 4. To be considered for an award, a tender shall be in writing and shall, at the time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notices and tender docu\u00ad mentation and be from a supplier that satisfies the conditions for participation. 5. Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, the entity shall award the contract to the supplier that the entity has determined to be capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender documentation, has submitted the most advantageous tender or where price is the sole criterion, the lowest price. 6. Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally lower than the prices in other tenders submitted, it may verify with the supplier that it satisfies the conditions for participation and is capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract. 7. A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a procurement or modify awarded contracts in a manner that circumvents the obligations under this Agreement. Article 55 Transparency of Procurement Information 1. A procuring entity shall promptly inform participating suppliers of the entity\u2019s contract award decisions and, on request, shall do so in writing. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 56, a procuring entity shall, on request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the entity did not select its tender and the relative advantages of the successful supplier\u2019s tender. 2. Not later than 72 days after the award of each contract covered by this Chapter, a procuring entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate paper or electronic medium listed in Appendix III. Where only an electronic medium is used, the information shall remain readily available for a reasonable period of time. The notice shall include at least the information set out in Appendix VII of ANNEX 1 to this Agreement. Article 56 Disclosure of Information 1. On request of the other Party, the Party shall provide promptly any information necessary to determine whether the procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with the Chapter, including information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender. In cases where release of this information would prejudice competition in future tenders, the Party that receives that information shall not disclose it to any supplier, except after consultation with, and agreement of, the Party that provided the information. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not provide to any supplier information that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers. 3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party, including its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to disclose confidential information where disclosure would impede law enforcement; might prejudice fair competition between suppliers; would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the protection of intellectual property; or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest. Article 57 Domestic Review Procedures 1. Each Party shall provide a timely, effective, transparent and non-discriminatory administrative or judicial review procedure through which a supplier may challenge: (a) a breach of this Chapter; or (b) where the supplier does not have a right to challenge directly a breach of the Chapter under the domestic law of the Party, a failure to comply with a Party\u2019s measures implementing this Chapter; arising in the context of a covered procurement, in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest. The procedural rules for all challenges shall be in writing and made generally available. 2. In the event of a complaint by a supplier, arising in the context of covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest, that there has been a breach or a failure as set out in paragraph 1, the Party concerned shall encourage its procuring entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the complaint through consultation. The procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the supplier\u2019s participation in ongoing or future procurement or right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review procedure. 3. Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and submit a challenge, which in no case be less than 10 days from the time when the basis of the challenge became known or reasonably should have become known to the supplier. 4. Each Party shall establish or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of its procuring entities to receive and review a challenge by a supplier arising in the context of a covered procurement. EN L 204/36 Official Journal of the European Union 31.7.2012 ",
        "5. Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 4 initially reviews a challenge, the Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is the subject of the challenge. A review body that is not a court shall either be subject to judicial review or have procedural guarantees that provide for: (a) the procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and disclose all relevant documents to the review body; (b) the participants to the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as \u2018participants\u2019) shall have the right to be heard prior to a decision of the review body being made on the challenge; (c) the participants shall have the right to be represented and accompanied; (d) the participants shall have access to all proceedings; (e) the participants shall have the right to request that the proceedings take place in public and that witnesses may be present; and (f) decisions or recommendations relating to challenges by suppliers shall be provided, in a timely fashion, in writing, with an explanation of the basis for each decision or recom\u00ad mendation. 6. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for: (a) prompt interim measures to preserve the supplier\u2019s oppor\u00ad tunity to participate in the procurement. Such interim measures may result in suspension of the procurement process. The procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. The case for not acting shall be provided in writing; and (b) where a review body had determined that there has been a breach or a failure as set out in paragraph 1, corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to either the costs for the preparation of the tender or the costs relating to the challenge, or both. Article 58 Further negotiations 1. The Parties will review annually the effective operation of this Chapter and the mutual opening of procurement markets.

Iraq will in the context of the WTO accession negotiations acknowledge its commitment for accession to the plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018GPA\u2019). Article 59 Asymmetrical regime and transitional measures Taking into account the development, financial and trade needs, Iraq will benefit from the following transitional measure: Iraq may provide for a temporary price preference programme consisting of a price differential of 5 % for goods and services and 10 % for works, applicable to supplies and services from purely Iraqis suppliers. The price preference programme will be phased-out within 10 years from the entry into force of this Agreement.

Ad ARTICLE 24 1. A juridical person is controlled by another juridical person if the latter has the power to name a majority of its directors or otherwise to legally direct its actions. 2. The terms \u2018constitution\u2019 and \u2018acquisition\u2019 of a juridical person shall be understood as including capital participation in a juridical person with a view to establishing or maintaining lasting economic links. Ad ARTICLE 25 Paragraph 1 Treatment arising from commitments of the Union on the supply of services by contractual services suppliers and independent professionals shall be excluded from this provision.

Paragraph 2 Iraq may meet the requirement of this paragraph by according to services, service suppliers, establishments and investors of the Union, either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own like services, service suppliers, establishments and investors. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of Iraq compared to like services, service suppliers, establishments and investors of the Union. Paragraph 3 For greater certainty, the notification should be addressed to the Director General of the Directorate General for Trade, or its successor. Ad ARTICLE 29 Paragraph 4 The sole fact of requiring a visa shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing those benefits.

        "DECISIONS EUROPEAN COUNCIL DECISION of 11 July 2012 amending the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union (2012/419/EU) THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 355(6) thereof, Having regard to the initiative of the French Republic, Having regard to the opinion of the European Commission, Whereas: (1) Article 355(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the European Council, on the initiative of the Member State concerned and acting unanimously after consulting the Commission, to adopt a decision amending the status, with regard to the Union, of a Danish, French or Netherlands country or territory referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 355. (2) In a letter from the French President dated 26 October 2011, the French Republic (hereinafter \u2018France\u2019) asked the European Council to take such a decision to enable Mayotte, which currently has the status of an overseas country or territory within the meaning of Article 355(2) TFEU and is listed as such in Annex II to the Treaty, to acquire the status of an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 TFEU. (3) France\u2019s request reflects the choice by the inhabitants of Mayotte to draw progressively closer to mainland France, confirmed by the referendum of 29 March 2009 in which 95,2 % of the votes cast were in favour of a proposal to make Mayotte a department. Accordingly, on 31 March 2011, Mayotte became the 101st French department and the fifth French overseas department. (4) The structural social and economic situation and the geographical situation of Mayotte present all the char\u00ad acteristics, referred to in Article 349 TFEU, of an outermost region within the meaning of that provision. References to Mayotte should therefore be inserted into Article 349, making the whole of that Article applicable to Mayotte, and into Article 355(1) TFEU. (5) The amendment of the status with regard to the European Union of Mayotte, in response to a demo\u00ad cratically expressed request, should represent a step consistent with Mayotte\u2019s acquisition of a status close to that of the mainland, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 With effect from 1 January 2014, Mayotte shall cease to be an overseas country or territory, to which the provisions of Part Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) apply, and shall become an outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 TFEU. Article 2 The TFEU shall be amended as follows: (1) in the first paragraph of Article 349, the word \u2018Mayotte\u2019 shall be inserted after the word \u2018Martinique\u2019; (2) in Article 355(1), the word \u2018Mayotte\u2019 shall be inserted after the word \u2018Martinique\u2019; (3) in Annex II, the sixth indent shall be deleted. Article 3 This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption. It shall apply from 1 January 2014. Done at Brussels, 11 July 2012. For the European Council The President H.
