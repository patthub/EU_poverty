        "EN EN COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES Brussels, 19.7.2007 COM(2007) 428 final 2007/0006 (CNS) Amended proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar (presented by the Commission) ",
        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The Community and the Republic of Madagascar negotiated and initialled, on 21 June 2006, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement which provides Community fishermen with fishing opportunities in Madagascar\u2019s fishing zone. This Partnership Agreement, accompanied by a Protocol and the Annex thereto, was signed for a period of six years from its entry into force and is renewable. On the date of its entry into force, this Agreement repeals and replaces the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar on fishing off the coast of Madagascar which entered into force on 28 January 1986. A proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar was adopted by the Commission on 25 January 2007. However, the Protocol and the Annex thereto setting out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of European Community vessels had to be re-negotiated, amended and re-signed on 16 March 2007 to accommodate requests for additional fishing opportunities for longliners. The reference tonnage and the financial contribution have been adjusted accordingly. The requests for additional fishing opportunities result from a joint declaration by the Council and the Commission No 10529/06 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 allowing the outermost regions, on the basis of Article 299 of the Treaty, to extend the system of public funding for renewal of their fleet. The requests are also in line with Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) recommendations authorising island or developing countries to submit a development plan for their fleet. An amended proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar is therefore necessary, to take account of the amendments made to the Protocol signed on 16 March 2007. This Protocol and the Annex thereto have been signed for a period of six years from 1 January 2007. Pending the entry into force of the new Agreement, this Protocol and the Annex thereto will enter into force on the date on which the Parties notify each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for that purpose. They will apply with effect from 1 January 2007. The main objective of the new Partnership Agreement is to strengthen cooperation between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Madagascar\u2019s fishing zone, in the interests of both Parties. The Commission\u2019s negotiating position was based in part on the results of an ex-post and ex-ante evaluation carried out by independent experts. The two Parties are taking part in a political dialogue on topics of mutual interest in the fisheries sector. In the Partnership Agreement, the current priorities of national fisheries policy in Madagascar will allow the identification by mutual agreement between the two Parties of objectives, and the annual and multiannual programming to attain them, with a view to ensuring sustainable and responsible management of the sector. The Partnership Agreement also provides for encouraging economic, scientific and technical cooperation in the fisheries sector and related sectors. ",
        "EN 3 EN The financial contribution as amended in the Protocol signed on 16 March 2007 is fixed at EUR 1 197 000 per year against a reference tonnage of 13 300 tonnes. Of this financial contribution, 80% will provide annual financial support for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Madagascar, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing. This financial support will be based on annual and multiannual programming. The fishing opportunities provided for in the Protocol amended on 16 March 2007 have been laid down according to three categories: (1) for the fishing category \u201cfreezer tuna seiners\u201d: 43 vessels; (2) for the fishing category \u201csurface longliners over 100 GT\u201d: 50 vessels; and (3) for the fishing category \u201csurface longliners of 100 GT or below\u201d: 26 vessels. In addition, five vessels may carry out exploratory line or bottom longline fishing for demersal species over two six-month periods. Shipowners\u2019 fees have been fixed for each category and, overall, could provide Madagascar with an additional annual income of around EUR 465 000 (for a reference tonnage of 13 300 tonnes). The Commission proposes on this basis that the Council adopt the conclusion of this new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar by Regulation. ",

        "EN 35 EN Protocol (VMS) setting out the provisions applicable to satellite monitoring of Community fishing vessels operating in Madagascar\u2019s EEZ 1. The provisions of this Protocol supplement the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar on fishing off the coast of Madagascar for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012 and apply in accordance with point 5. of \u201cChapter VIII \u2013 Monitoring\u201d in the Annex thereto. 2. All fishing vessels with an overall length exceeding 15 metres operating under the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar shall be monitored by satellite when fishing in Madagascar\u2019s EEZ. For the purposes of the satellite monitoring, the Malagasy authorities shall communicate to the Community party the latitude and longitude coordinates of Madagascar\u2019s EEZ. The Malagasy authorities shall transmit this information in electronic form, expressed in decimal degrees (WGS 84). 3. The Parties shall exchange information on X.25 addresses and the specifications for electronic data transmission between their Control Centres in accordance with points 5 and 7. Such information shall include the following where they exist: names, telephone, telex and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses (Internet or X.400) which may be used for general communications between Control Centres. 4. The position of vessels shall be determined with a margin of error of less than 500 metres and a confidence interval of 99%. 5. When a vessel which is fishing under the Agreement and is the subject of satellite monitoring pursuant to Community legislation enters Madagascar\u2019s EEZ, the subsequent position reports (vessel identification, longitude, latitude, course and speed) shall be transmitted immediately by the Control Centre of the flag State to Madagascar\u2019s Fisheries Monitoring Centre (FMC) at intervals of no more than three hours. The messages concerned shall be identified as position reports. 6. The messages specified in point 5 shall be transmitted electronically in X.25 format, or any other secure protocol. They shall be communicated in real time in the format set out in Table II. 7. Where the continuous satellite monitoring equipment installed on board a fishing vessel develops a technical fault or breaks down, the skipper of the vessel shall transmit the information specified in point 5 to the Control Centre of the flag State and Madagascar\u2019s FMC in good time. It will be necessary in those circumstances to send a global position report at 06.00, 12.00 and 18.00 Madagascar time. This global position report shall include the position reports as recorded by the skipper of the vessel on a three-hourly basis in accordance with the requirements laid down in point 5. ",
        "EN 36 EN The Control Centre of the flag State shall send these messages to Madagascar\u2019s FMC. The faulty equipment shall be repaired or replaced within a period of not more than one month. After this deadline, the vessel in question must leave Madagascar\u2019s EEZ. 8. The Control Centres of the flag States shall monitor the movements of their vessels in Malagasy waters. If the vessels are not being monitored in accordance with the conditions laid down, Madagascar\u2019s FMC shall be informed by the FMC of the flag State as soon as this is discovered and the procedure laid down in point 7 shall be applicable. 9. If Madagascar\u2019s FMC establishes that the flag State is not transmitting the information specified in point 5, the competent European Commission departments shall be informed immediately. 10. The monitoring data communicated to the other party in accordance with these provisions is intended solely for the purposes of the Malagasy authorities in controlling and monitoring the Community fleet fishing under the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar. Such data may not under any circumstances be communicated to other parties. 11. The satellite-monitoring system software and hardware components shall be reliable and shall not permit the input or output of false positions or be capable of being manually overridden. The system shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of environmental and weather conditions. Destroying, damaging, rendering inoperative or tampering with the satellite-monitoring system shall be prohibited. Skippers shall ensure that: \u2013 data are not altered in any way; \u2013 the antenna or antennas connected to the satellite-monitoring equipment are not obstructed; \u2013 the power supply of the satellite-monitoring equipment is not interrupted; and \u2013 the satellite-monitoring equipment is not removed from the vessel. 12. The Parties agree to exchange upon request information on the equipment used for satellite monitoring, in order to ensure that each piece of equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other Party for the purposes of these provisions. 13. Any dispute over the interpretation or application of these provisions shall be the subject of consultation between the Parties within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 9 of the Agreement. 14.

CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term The main objective of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) is to strengthen cooperation between the European Community and Madagascar to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fisheries resources in Madagascar\u2019s fishing zone. The main elements of the new Protocol are: \u2013 Fishing opportunities : 43 freezer tuna seiners, 50 surface longliners over 100 GT and 26 surface longliners under 100 GT, i.e. 31 longline licences allowing incorporation of a fleet of small longliners of under 100 GT from the outermost regions and 5 new licences for exploratory demersal fishing, which did not exist under the previous protocol. \u2013 Annual reference tonnage: 13 300 tonnes of tuna \u2013 Annual financial contribution: EUR 1 197 000 ",
        "EN 45 EN \u2013 Advances and fees payable by vessel-owners: EUR 35 (compared with EUR 25 previously) per tonne of tuna. The amount for demersal fishing licences will be fixed after the exploratory fishing phase. The advances are fixed at EUR 3 920 per year per tuna seiner, EUR 3 500 per year per surface longliner over 100 GT and EUR 1 680 per year per surface longliner under 100 GT. 5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy Regarding this new FPA, if the Community does not act, then private agreements will spring up which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The Community therefore hopes that, thanks to this FPA, Madagascar will cooperate effectively with the Community in regional bodies such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), in the fight against illegal fishing and for the proper management of stocks of highly migratory species. 5.3 Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework The negotiation and conclusion of fishing agreements with third countries meets the general objective of maintaining and safeguarding the traditional fishing activities of the Community fleet, including the distant-water fleet, and developing relations in a spirit of partnership with a view to strengthening the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources outside Community waters, taking account of environmental, social and economic concerns. The following indicators will be used in the context of the ABM for the purposes of monitoring implementation of the Agreement: \u2022 monitoring the utilisation rate of the fishing opportunities; \u2022 gathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the Agreement; \u2022 contribution to employment and value-added in the Community; \u2022 contribution to stabilising the Community market; \u2022 contribution to the general objectives of reducing poverty in Madagascar, including the contribution to employment, development of infrastructure and support for the state budget; \u2022 number of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee. 5.4 Method of implementation (indicative) Indicate below the method(s) 13 of implementation chosen.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION 6.1 Monitoring system The Commission (DG FISH, in collaboration with the European Commission Delegation to Madagascar) will ensure regular monitoring of implementation of this Agreement, particularly in terms of its use by operators and catch data. 6.2 Assessment A comprehensive evaluation was carried out on the Protocol currently in force, ending in March 2006, with the assistance of a consortium of independent consultants, with a view to the launch of negotiations on a new Protocol. 6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation The key elements of the evaluation highlight the use of fishing opportunities, which have always been satisfactory for seiners (83% in 2004, 93% in 2005 and 98% in 2006) and for longliners (78% in 2004, 85% in 2005 and 100% in 2006). As regards tonnages caught, the results vary widely. Constant at around 8 000 tonnes per year until 2001, these fell sharply in 2003 and 2004 to just a few hundred tonnes. This is the result of as yet unexplained biological phenomena which led to a concentration of tuna around Tanzania at the point when it was expected in the Mozambique Channel. The year 2005 marked a return to normal, with catches in excess of 12 000 tonnes in Madagascar\u2019s fishing zone. According to ex-ante evaluation, the conclusion of the new Agreement is beneficial for both sides. - Added value of Community involvement: While the Community\u2019s return on its investment in 2004 was negative (low catches), in 2005 it was in line with the level measured for other tuna agreements at EUR 4.8 million of value-added for the Community. In other words, each euro invested generated around EUR 5 in value-added. The economic rewards for Madagascar are estimated at EUR 2.2 million per year (financial contribution, licence fees and economic impact), plus EUR 5.4 million per year in value-added generated by the canning industry. The agreement will support around 1 100 on-board and shore-based jobs for EC nationals from regions which are dependent on fishing. The Fisheries Agreement guarantees a substantial share of resources to the sectoral fisheries policy in Madagascar. ",
        "EN 47 EN - Risks and alternative options: There is some risk in setting up a fisheries protocol, for example: the amounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy and shipowners\u2019 fees might not be allocated as agreed (fraud), foreign fleets might ignore licences and other controls. To avoid these risks, extensive dialogue is planned on the programming and implementation of the sectoral policy, in particular in the field of control and monitoring. 6.2.2 Ex-ante estimate of the economic value of the Agreement and the Community\u2019s financial contribution The Agreement meets a need of Community shipping by procuring fishing opportunities for a resource which is spread randomly through migration across international waters and coastal states\u2019 EEZ. Madagascar\u2019s fishing zone is important in this respect during at least one quarter of the year. The Agreement is also considered to correspond to Madagascar\u2019s need to be able to generate revenue in foreign currency from a resource which the country does not have the means to exploit itself. The financial contribution granted by the Community under this new Fisheries Partnership Agreement is a single allocation established on the basis of an annual financial envelope of EUR 1 197 000 for the 2007-12 Protocol. 6.2.3 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) The reference tonnage remains similar and may be increased slightly. The advance for the licences for large longliners has been reassessed. The dialogue with the Malagasy authorities which was lacking in the previous Protocol has been re-established. 6.2.4 Terms and frequency of future evaluation Following on from the study finalised in March 2006 (cf. point 6.2), in order to ensure sustainable fishing in the region, an evaluation of the economic, social and environmental impact will be carried out before each future renewal of the Protocol. The indicators listed in point 5.3 will be used to carry out an ex-post evaluation. 7. A NTI - FRAUD MEASURES The use to which the financial contribution paid by the Community under the Agreement is put is entirely at the discretion of the sovereign third country concerned. Nevertheless, the Commission undertakes to try and establish permanent political dialogue and cooperation with a view to improving the management of the Protocol and strengthening the Community\u2019s contribution to the sustainable management of resources.
