Urges the Member States to improve their national laws and policies to combat all forms of violence against women, in particular through the development of comprehensive national action plans to combat violence against women, based on an analysis of the gender-equality implications of violence against women and the international treaty obligations of Member States to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, and including concrete measures to prevent male violence, protect victims and prosecute perpe\u00ad trators; 2. Urges the Member States to provide assistance, under appropriate national programmes and financing schemes, to voluntary bodies and organisations which offer shelter and psychological support to female victims of violence, not least in order to enable them to re-enter the labour market and in that way fully regain their human dignity; 3. Calls on the Commission to submit to the Parliament and the Council a targeted and a more coherent EU policy plan to combat all forms of violence against women, as stated in the Commission communication of 1 March 2006 entitled \u2018A Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010\u2019 (COM(2006)0092), to include measures to combat violence against women in its action programme for equal opportunities for men and women for 2011-2016, as well as concrete measures to prevent all forms of violence, protect victims and prosecute perpetrators, and to ensure that an analysis of the gender equality implications of male violence against women in all policy areas is carried out and that the EU institutions and the Member States develop a coordinated, committed and coherent response in order to eradicate such violence; 4.

Urges the Member States to recognise sexual violence and rape against women, including within marriage and intimate informal relationships and/or where committed by male relatives, as a crime in cases where the victim did not give consent, and to ensure that such offences result in automatic prosecution and reject any reference to cultural, traditional or religious practices or traditions as a mitigating factor in cases of violence against women, including so-called \u2018crimes of honour\u2019 and female genital mutilation; 25.
