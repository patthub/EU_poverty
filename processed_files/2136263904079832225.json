        "3 The European Council adopted on 12 December 2003 the European Security Strategy \u00abA Secure Europe in a better world\u00bb. This strategy identifies five key challenges faced by the EU: terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), regional conflicts, State failure and organised crime. The proliferation of WMD is defined as potentially the greatest threat to European security. In parallel, on 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted a Strategy against the Proliferation of WMD, which states that WMD and missile proliferation put at risk the security of EU Member States, their people and their interests around the world. The EU must act with resolve, using all instruments and policies at its disposal. The ultimate objective is to prevent, deter, halt and where possible, eliminate WMD proliferation programmes of concern worldwide. Since the adoption of both strategies, the European Union has undertaken a number of initiatives. The principles on which they are based are effective multilateralism, prevention and international cooperation. This brochure aims to illustrate the implementation of these aspects of EU external action. The European Union is aware that WMD are not the only serious threat: small arms and light weapons are responsible for almost 500,000 deaths a year. The EU has consequently decided to actively combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition.

        "9 THE EUROPEAN UNION SECURITY STRATEGY T he European Security Strategy identifies proliferation as one of the five key challenges to international security, together with terrorism, regional conflicts, State failure and organised crime. The EU considers proliferation as a growing threat: while the international Treaty regimes and export controls arrangements have slowed the spread of WMD and delivery systems, a number of states have sought or are seeking to develop such weapons. The risk that terrorists will acquire chemical, biological, or nuclear materials and their means of delivery adds a new critical dimension to this threat. The European Security Strategy makes clear that the European Union cannot ignore these dangers. The policy against proliferation of WMD is therefore a central element in the EU\u2019s external action. The EU is committed to, and does really act, using all instruments and policies at its disposal. The EU\u2019s objective is to prevent, deter, halt and, where possible, eliminate proliferation programmes of concern worldwide. At the same time, the EU will continue to address the root causes of instability including through pursuing and intensifying its efforts in the areas of political solution to conflicts, development assistance, reduction of poverty and promotion of human rights.

        "10 EUROPEAN UNION STRATEGY AGAINST THE PROLIFERATION OF WMD The EU WMD Strategy defines the EU line on the basis of three basic principles: effective multilateralism, prevention and cooperation. A) Effective multilateralism: Since proliferation is a threat to international security as a whole, nobody can expect to be able to achieve good results by acting on its own. It is important that all States be bound by the same rules. This is why the EU supports the multilateral Treaties and Conventions, and the multilateral fora, and contributes to their effectiveness. B) Prevention: In order to prevent the spread of sensitive materials and technologies the EU works in particular on: \u2013 Universalisation of multilateral instruments which impose non-proliferation obligations; \u2013 Enhancing the implementation of international obligations, by providing assistance to national implementation; \u2013 Enhancing export controls not only within the EU Member States but also in partner countries; \u2013 Contributing to the safe dismantlement of WMD; \u2013 Enhancing national capabilities to prevent illicit trafficking; On behalf of the EU, the Federal Foreign Office of Germany delivered a nitrogen supply station in Kambarka, Russian Federation (Chemical weapons destruction project) \u00a9 F e d e r a l F o r e i g n O ffi c e o f G e r m a n y ",
        "11 \u2013 Re-directing scientists previously working on WMD programmes to peaceful activities. In addition, the EU fosters regional security arrangements and regional arms control and disarmament processes. C) Cooperation: Close cooperation with partners is crucial for the effectiveness of non-proliferation policy. The EU has adopted together with a number of partners (USA, Japan, The People\u2019s Republic of China) a joint statement including a joint programme of work. The EU cooperates in the field of non-proliferation with all other countries with which it has strong relations. The EU has undertaken the commitment to cooperate in the framework of formal agreements (WMD clause) with more than 100 countries. THE EU HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY, JAVIER SOLANA, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WMD STRATEGY The High Representative for CFSP, Javier Solana, is very committed to the implementation of the EU WMD Strategy. His constant concern is to support the effectiveness of multilateralism. He is fully involved EU Troika with the African Union P h o t o : C o u n c i l o f t h e E U ",

In October 2003, he appointed a Personal Representative on non-proliferation to co-ordinate, help implement and further develop the EU WMD Strategy, and to give sharper focus to these issues in the dialogue with third countries. The Office of the Personal Representative is in charge of all issues related not only to non-proliferation but to dis armament, arms controls and dual-use as well. The Office also supports HR Solana in his diplomatic efforts towards Iran. The establishment of a WMD Monitoring Centre In order to further enhance the consistent implementation of the WMD Strategy, a cooperative working method was defined by the Council in December 2006, which allows the Council Secretariat/High Representative, the Commission and Member States to work together and ensure better synergy.

O n 28 April 2004, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1540 as the first international instrument that deals in an integrated and comprehensive manner with weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and related materials. The rationale for both the UN Security Council Resolution 1540 and the European Union WMD Strategy coincide in many respects. Both recognise that: 1. Proliferation of WMD is a threat to all, 2. All this implies national responsibility but no State can succeed alone. Therefore, we need concerted efforts by all States in a spirit of cooperation, 3. In order to counter this threat, we all need to apply the same standards and therefore we all need multilateral Treaties and institutions, respect for and effectiveness of the multilateral system, United Nations Security Council \u00a9 U n i t e d N a t i o n s ",

We need to work on prevention; it is important to prevent the threat from becoming a reality. Therefore, we need to make sure that terrorists do not get access to materials and technologies which can be used to produce weapons of mass destruction. UN Members have to report to the Committee set up by UNSC Resolution 1540 on the national measures taken to comply with the Resolution. With the adoption of UNSCR 1810 (2008), the Security Council extended the mandate of the 1540 Committee until 2011. AREAS OF EU SUPPORT TO UNSCR 1540 The EU and the Members States have reported to the 1540 Committee on the implementation of UNSCR 1540 and are constantly updating their legislation in order to cover all aspects of their obligations under the Resolution. The EU is raising awareness about requirements and obligations under the Resolution. In its contacts with third countries, the EU promotes compliance with the provisions of the Resolution and the submission of national reports. Technical assistance and exchanges of experience gained from preparing national reports and adopting measures to implement UNSC Resolution 1540 can increase compliance with the reporting obligation. The EU and the Member States are accordingly sharing such experience.

It entered into force on 5 March 1970. Only 3 States are not yet party to the Treaty. The Treaty is based on three pillars: 1. NON-PROLIFERATION: The five nuclear-weapon States (The People\u2019s Republic of China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States) are committed not to transfer to any recipient nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear devices. The non-nuclear-weapon States are committed not to seek or receive any assistance to that effect (Art. I and II). 2. DISARMAMENT: All parties to the Treaty are committed to pursue negotiations in good faith to put an end to the nuclear arms race, to disarm and to pursue negotiations towards a treaty on general and complete disarmament (Art. VI). 3. COOPERATION: The Treaty affirms the right of all States Parties to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, without discrimination but on condition that they comply with their non-proliferation obligations. All parties are committed to cooperate in the further development of nuclear energy for peaceful uses. (Art. IV). ",

According to its statute, the Agency\u2019s mission consists in accelerating and enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. Under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA has a specific role as international \u00absafeguards\u00bb inspectorate: it verifies compliance with the non-proliferation obligations by Member States. It serves as a multilateral forum for cooperation on the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. The IAEA also verifies the disablement or transformation of nuclear material formerly used for nuclear weapons. The IAEA Nuclear Security Plan 2006-2009 adopted by the Board of Governors in September 2005 pursues key objectives which are also key elements of the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The plan aims at a comprehensive approach to nuclear security including regulatory controls, accountability and protection of nuclear and other radioactive materials in use, storage and transport, \u2018from cradle to grave\u2019, in the short term as well as in the long term. IAEA support for these efforts continues to be in high demand among IAEA Member States as well as in States that are not members of the IAEA. The EU is the largest contributor to the nuclear security fund.

Promotion of the universalisation of multilateral non-proliferation and nuclear security instruments, including comprehensive safeguards agreements and the Additional Protocol; 2. Enhancement of the protection of proliferation-sensitive materials and equipment and the relevant technology. As a result, the physical protection of nuclear materials and other radioactive materials at selected nuclear facilities and locations is upgraded. In addition, vulnerable radioactive sources in non-nuclear applications are protected or, as appropriate, dismantled and transferred to safe and secure storage in the selected countries; 3. Provision of legislative and regulatory assistance in the area of nuclear security and safeguards. The result is the development and adoption of comprehensive, coherent and effective legislation at national level, thereby contributing to a harmonised, strengthened and more universal system of nuclear security; Verification training exercice in real-life scenarios \u00a9 D e a n C a l m a / I A E A ",

Detection and early warning of potential risks (e.g. discovery of theft or smuggling of nuclear material by border guards) c. Reaction to and remediation of the risk (e.g. a response plan for illicit trafficking and nuclear forensics) The European Union is active in all these 3 areas, both within Europe and abroad. The progressive enlargement of the EU is accompanied by increased cooperation. Nuclear and radiological vulnerability is under assessment to improve preparedness.

Under the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT): 1. Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any nuclear weapons test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control. 2. Each State Party undertakes to refrain from causing, encouraging, or in any way participating in the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. The Treaty was opened for signature in New york on 24 September 1996. Fourty- four countries possessing nuclear technology, listed in its annex II, have to ratify the Treaty in order for it to enter into force. Ten still have to do so. HOW CAN COMPLIANCE WITH CTBT BE VERIFIED? 1. The Treaty provides for the setting up of an organisation (CTBTO) in charge of the verification. In the period before the entry into force of the Treaty, and as long as CTBTO is not in place, a Preparatory Commission is tasked with making preparations for its implementation, in particular by establishing its verification regime.

A second project aims at improving the knowledge of noble gas measurements. Noble gas monitoring is a fundamental and highly sensitive technique for the detection of underground and underwater nuclear explosions. Of all verification technologies, it is, together with radionuclide particulate monitoring, the only technique that has the potential to provide incontrovertible proof of a nuclear explosion. 3. A third project covers support to on-site inspections. It consists in logistic transportation of equipment, the establishment of operational base camps, and the evaluation workshop. 4. A fourth project is aimed at providing technical assistance to states signatories in Africa in order to improve the operability of the CTBT monitoring and verification system in this region.

It bans completely and without exception an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. States Parties cannot develop, produce, acquire, stockpile or assist a third party to possess any chemical weapons. The CWC prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires the destruction of all existing chemical weapons under international verification. It also provides for international cooperation among States Parties in the pursuit of chemistry for peaceful purposes. The Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force on 29 April 1997. The verification of the implementation of the Convention is entrusted to the OPCW. This organisation also provides assistance to States Parties upon request and facilitates cooperation from other States Parties helping the requesting party to fulfil its obligations under the Convention. A total of 71,331 tons of chemical weapons have been declared to OPCW. Over 30% of this stock (around 22,500 tons) had been destroyed by 30 April 2007.

The purpose of this partnership is to provide the means for a more effective control over chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons and materials, in particular to prevent terrorists from acquiring them. Today the Global Partnership includes the countries of the G8, the European Union, and a total of 13 other donor States (Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland). Donors have established programmes in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The EU WMD Strategy, adopted in December 2003, consolidated the foundations of EU-G8 cooperation in the field of non-proliferation. The EU Strategy against WMD proliferation states that \u00abcooperation with the US and other key partners such as the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada is necessary to ensure a successful outcome of the global fight against proliferation\u00bb.

SALW are responsible for almost 500 000 deaths a year, 300 000 of which occur in armed conflicts. The consequences of the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of SALW and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread are central to four of the five security challenges identified by the European Security Strategy. SALW can contribute to terrorism and organised crime, and are a major factor in triggering and spreading conflicts, as well as in the collapse of State structures. They represent a security concern for all. The European Union has therefore decided to actively address this problem through its SALW Strategy. THE EU SALW STRATEGY The European Council adopted on 16 December 2005 a Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition. The EU SALW Strategy, building on existing EU policies and programmes, outlines a comprehensive approach using all instruments available to the EU. The EU is active in third countries affected by excessive accumulation of small arms but is also tackling the problem of the source of the illicit small arms flows. The Strategy identifies Africa as the continent worst affected by the impact of internal and cross border conflicts aggravated by the destabilising influx of small arms and light weapons.
