        "EU International Cooperation and Development EU\u2019s development and external assistance are part and parcel of an integrated EU approach that tackles the causes of poverty. Within the European Commis- sion, the Directorate-General for International Coop- eration and Development (DG DEVCO) is in charge of development cooperation policy. Development policy is a key tool whereby the EU and its member states respond to current global challeng- es and opportunities. The New European Consensus on Development (June 2017) aligns EU development policy with the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while embedding the Ad- dis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Cli- mate Change and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction. The New Consensus provides a shared vision and framework for action on development cooperation for the European Union and its Member States. It pro- motes a coherent approach to people, planet, prosper- ity, peace and partnership (the \u201cfive Ps\u201d of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Poverty eradi- cation remains the primary objective, while integrating comprehensively the social, economic and environ- mental dimensions of sustainable development. The EU Results Framework The EU International Cooperation and Development Re- sults Framework provides a selection of results achieved in about 100 partner countries across the globe with the support of EU international cooperation. The results shown in this brochure cover key results ac- complished by EU-funded interventions completed be- tween 2013 and 2017. They represent the combined efforts of a variety of partners including EU and partner countries government and public institutions, local com- munities, international and finance agencies, civil society organisations, non-profit entities, and private companies. Results reporting supports accountability and transparen- cy with EU citizens, institutions and stakeholders on the EU contribution to development progress in partner coun- tries. It also contributes to decision making and lessons learning while strengthening effectiveness of EU interna- tional cooperation.

        "EU INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT Pastores andinos - Weavers of economic space and food integration in the Andean region The EU supported an intervention to strengthen food security in the Andean region of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Argentina. The initiative aimed at enhancing the cooperation among camelid breeders (Alpaca, Lama, Vigogna), local and regional institutions and national governments across borders, spread knowledge concerning food security, and lobby for healthy food and local pastoral farming. Among the results achieved: an Andean healthy food programme which proposes ways to improve the diets and food security of shepherd communities was developed and presented in all countries at local and national level; the Confederation of South American domestic camelids\u2019 breeders was established; over 800 community leaders trained on pastoral and water management and over 900 women participated in trainings on nutrition and food habits. Global thematic programme: Farmers Fighting Poverty Africa Farmers\u2019 organisations are essential actors with major impact on achieving global SDG goals. With a view to improving the livelihoods and food security situation of rural poor producers in Sub-Sahara Africa, the EU supported farmers\u2019 organisations through the Farmers Fighting Poverty programme. It aimed at improving performance and accountability of farmers\u2019 organisations to better represent and advise their members\u2019.

Among the results achieved: over 2 200 km of roads were rehabilitated improving the mobility of more than 30 000 Haitians. Ukraine - Poltava region for internally displaced persons The EU is committed to promote efficient, sustainable and equitable social protection systems to build resilience and empower people with knowledge, skills and competencies to seize or create employment opportunities. In Ukraine, the EU has provided support to conflict affected communities through various interventions at local level. In the Poltava region, the EU contributed to the integration and stay of internally displaced persons. This included strengthening the capacity of local authorities to effectively manage crisis and social needs and to create better conditions for integration through education and jobs. Among the results achieved: more than 1 000 persons were employed with the support of the Poltava Regional Employment Centre. Increasing climate resilience of Pacific Small Islands States Pacific Small Islands States are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially to rising air and sea temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels and ocean acidification. In the framework of the Global Climate Change Alliance Initiative, the EU supported these countries to tackle the adverse effects of climate change and to promote long-term strategies and approaches to adaptation. With EU support over the period 2011 - 2016, national climate change policies integrating disaster risk management were prepared and endorsed in the Republic of Nauru, Palau and Tonga; sector plans on agricultural, coastal management and water and sanitation were also drafted, incorporating climate change resilience, for Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga, Tuvalu. School Sector Reform Plan Programme in Nepal Despite progress in the last few years, millions of children are still denied their right to education. The access to education for boys and girls is one of the top priorities of the EU. In Nepal, the EU provided support to the school sector reform with the objective of increasing access to and improving the quality of school education, particularly for children from marginalised groups. It helped the government create the political space to introduce complex reform measures and restructure the school sector to translate the education quality agenda into concrete steps for better uptake. Over the period 2009-2016, 3 320 000 students were enrolled in secondary school (1 710 000 girls and 1 610 000 boys) with EU support. Providing Solar Home Systems to rural population in Guinea-Bissau Guinea-Bissau has one of the lowest electrification rates in Africa. The EU supports the country to extend the use of hydroelectric and solar energy, especially in rural areas. In the region of Gab\u00fa in east Guinea-Bissau, solar home systems were provided on a fee-for-service basis and a national company to manage the services was also set up. Among the results achieved: over 30 000 people \u2013of which more than half are women\u2013 received access to basic energy services in the form of light, mobile phone charging, a plug for other services and a connector for televisions. Support to the South Sudan Health Pooled Fund In its partner countries, the EU provides assistance to prevent and combat communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and hepatitis; to strengthen all areas of the health system, to increase life expectancy and promote quality health services accessible for all. Through its support to a health pooled fund in South Sudan, the EU has contributed to strengthening resilience of communities and in particular of the most vulnerable groups, including refugees and internally displaced persons. Over the period 2012-2016, 610 000 births were attended by skilled health personnel and 400 000 children under one (200 000 girls and 200 000 boys) were immunised.
