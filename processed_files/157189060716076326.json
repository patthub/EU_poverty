        "4 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities Since the OPEN DAYS were fi rst introduced in 2003, they have proven to be a unique platform in Europe for communication, discussion and networking among regions and players in the fi eld of regional and cohesion policy. In 2007, the 212 participating regions and cities will strive to show how effective this policy is and to highlight its key role within the Lisbon Agenda. The title of the fi fth OPEN DAYS event refl ects this ambitious challenge: \u2018Making it happen\u2019. Let\u2019s make sure that the regions and cities reach their targets for growth and job creation \u2013 the yardsticks for prosperity and quality of life in our Member States. \u2018Let\u2019s make it happen\u2019 in regions that are not only more competitive but more supportive, where opportunities for action are created for the public authorities and private sector alike. \u2018Let\u2019s make it happen\u2019 in our regions and our cities, the wellsprings of talent and resources, which, since the structural funds were established for 2007-2013, have launched 450 new projects for economic development and social cohesion. The OPEN DAYS provide these regions and cities with a real showcase for their know-how and creative intelligence and build networks based on their remarkable successes. Once again, this year\u2019s OPEN DAYS will feature the Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 where businesses, banks, local and regional authorities and European institutions can meet and compare approaches and create new partnerships based on common economic projects. The Committee of the Regions, alongside the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Regional Policy and other EU institutions, is clearly fulfi lling its role, giving this year\u2019s 5 000 expected participants from 33 countries an exceptional opportunity to share their success stories and contributions to a competitive and supportive European Union. Organisers Michel Delebarre President of the Committee of the Regions Danuta H\u00fcbner Member of the European Commission responsible for Regional Policy 2007 is the year of delivery for EU cohesion policy. We will put in place more than 450 national, regional and cross-border programmes for the period 2007-2013 with a total investment of about EUR 500 billion of public and private funding. In May the Commission issued the 4th Report on Economic and Social Cohesion to provide a thorough insight into the current situation and the progress made towards achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion in the regions of the European Union. It also investigates the new challenges for regional development in the years ahead. The Report shows clearly that all regions are confronted with the need to restructure, modernise and foster continuous knowledge-based innovation in order to meet the challenge of globalisation. This analysis is essential, since it has become obvious in recent years that regional development and convergence is best driven through multi-level governance, through the co-ordinated actions of the Union, the Member States and local and regional authorities. As in previous years, the OPEN DAYS 2007 will bring together all EU, national, regional and local experts to discuss regional development issues, to come up with new ideas and to cross-check whether future regional policy delivery can be enhanced and how. I look forward to this extremely interesting and inspiring opportunity to meet with regional policy experts, practitioners and scholars and to exchange our views and thoughts. This year, the OPEN DAYS 2007 will feature an even greater international dimension of regional policy, as representatives from countries such as China, Russia and Brazil will be present and will put forward their approach towards enhanced regional convergence and competitiveness. In other words \u2013 the OPEN DAYS 2007 is an event you cannot miss! COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 4 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 4 28/06/07 15:35:06 28/06/07 15:35:06 ",
        "European institutions Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso President of the European Commission I\u2019m delighted that the Committee of the Regions and the European Commission are teaming up once again to host the OPEN DAYS. The fact that so many of you want to be part of this festival of the regions shows the importance of this initiative. It is an event that successfully brings together nearly 5,000 participants, representing 212 regions and cities in 33 countries, as well as stakeholders from the business and banking sectors, NGOs and European associations. This event epitomises the Europe of results that we are building together. The basis of European integration is regional solidarity based on economic and social cohesion. Our economic, political and social plans for 2007-2013 are ambitious. Regional and local authorities will benefi t from funding amounting to 35% of the EU budget, or 500 billion \u20ac including private money. To turn these fi gures into achievements, concrete projects are needed to transform the regions and cities into a modern economic and social space, to stimulate local initiatives that will attract investors and create growth and employment. It is you who will have to do much of the day-to-day work on this. One of the great strengths of Europe\u2019s regions and cities is their ability to interact with one another through exchanges of experience and ideas \u2013 as the massive response to the OPEN DAYS demonstrates. The spirit of multinational, multilingual and multicultural dialogue that accompanies your discussions proves that a real Europe is being created through your actions, enriched by dynamism and enthusiasm. I very much appreciate the themes you have chosen for the agenda of your seminars because we share the same priorities \u2013 energy, transport, environment, innovation and research. Focusing on these issues helps bring the EU closer to citizens. It is my conviction that the regional and local authorities have a vital role to play to increase the confi dence of citizens in Europe. We can reach this objective through concrete results and through providing solutions. The slogan of this year\u2019s OPEN DAYS \u2013 Making it happen: regions and cities deliver jobs and growth \u2013 says it all. I hope the event is a great success. Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering President of the European Parliament Members of the European Parliament are the link between the EU\u2019s institutions and citizens. Each and every MEP has their home in a European region, and it is only natural that they build strong partnerships with the local and regional authorities in their home region. Together they are better able to develop understanding amongst citizens of the benefi ts of European Union, and help more citizens take advantage of the fruits of EU action. No EU initiative is more important than the growth and jobs strategy, which promises to improve the lives of each and every citizen. But this can only happen if we all work together towards our common goal. With this in mind, the European Parliament strongly supports the aims of the OPEN DAYS initiative, and looks forward to a fi ne opportunity to develop further links amongst the democratically elected representatives of Europe\u2019s citizens at all levels. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Prime Minister of Portugal, on behalf of the EU Presidency 2007 marks the beginning of a new Structural Funds programme period, in which the EU\u2019s regional policy reinforces its focus on Lisbon goals. Regions and cities are now fully recognised as fundamental governance levels to create growth and jobs at the European level. An ever more competitive Europe must rely on dynamic and attractive territories fully engaged in the global economy. Attracting investment, fuelling innovation, qualifying the human capital, those are the challenges that regional development policies must meet in the years to come. OPEN DAYS is the major European gathering of regional policy experts, decision-makers and stakeholders. This event\u2019s growing success is proof of regions and cities\u2019 eagerness to meet, co-operate, create networks and exchange best practices, thus driving European efforts to modernise our societies and our economies. As the country holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU, Portugal is pleased to contribute to the success of OPEN DAYS 2007. By disseminating a shared vision at the dawn of a new programme period, this event has the potential to be a decisive impulse for regional development in Europe.

        "6 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities Jacques Barrot Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for Transport G\u00fcnter Verheugen Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for Enterprise and Industry Margot Wallstr\u00f6m Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy Transport networks are a vital part of the fabric of any region. Large or small, Europe\u2019s regions need effi cient, cost-effective, environmentally friendly and appropriate transport infrastructure. Our single market depends on the effi ciency with which goods can be transported, and the competitiveness of our enterprises also requires that their workforces can travel to and from work as easily as possible. We are working to give public authorities, private enterprise and transport operators fair conditions in which transport services can be organised and used. We are also seeking to minimise the disparities and disadvantages faced by peripheral and rural regions, and enable the least developed regions to develop better transport infrastructure. Investment is the key to successfully implementing transport projects, and the OPEN DAYS will provide the opportunity for regional authorities to learn about investment models which have delivered transport improvements elsewhere. Competitiveness is vital for Europe\u2019s businesses and citizens. All our efforts in the Enterprise and Industry DG are aimed squarely at creating the conditions in which all citizens can benefi t from dynamic companies creating prosperity, high quality jobs and helping us to tackle the challenges of our age. Regional and local authorities, along with national governments, must all play their part in improving the environment in which European enterprise operates. We need to cut red tape, to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, and stimulate investment in nascent businesses. All small fi rms and entrepreneurs need a home base, and the actions of regional authorities are fundamental in creating attractive conditions for enterprises. These OPEN DAYS will allow regions to demonstrate their successes to each other and enable them to learn from each other\u2019s experiences in supporting and stimulating enterprise and job creation. Europe\u2019s regions, cities and local authorities are the building blocks of the Union. Thousands and thousands of EU-supported projects and initiatives over the years have brought real benefi ts to citizens in every corner of the EU, and these OPEN DAYS offer a valuable opportunity to demonstrate how regional authorities are making effective and imaginative use of EU support to help their citizens. And I am especially pleased to welcome the wealth of local events in support of the OPEN DAYS programme throughout the month, building on the experiences of last year\u2019s events. Effective communication requires going beyond the Brussels beltway and engaging with people on the issues that concern them. These local events are a valuable added dimension to the OPEN DAYS. People are Europe\u2019s greatest resource, and we must enable more of our fellow citizens to contribute effectively to our economy. The European Social Fund \u2013 50 years old this year \u2013 is the Union\u2019s key resource for helping our citizens acquire the skills to play an active role in today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s enterprises. Only by renewing skills can Europe\u2019s workers help their enterprises to compete in the global marketplace. At the same time the European Social Fund makes a major contribution to the promotion of social cohesion throughout the Union, by enhancing job opportunities for all of our citizens. The ESF must be used effectively if our citizens are to derive maximum benefi t from it, and the OPEN DAYS will enable local and regional authorities to see the wealth of initiatives it has supported and seek ideas for their own programmes.

        "OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 7 Markos Kyprianou Member of the European Commission responsible for Health Joe Borg Member of the European Commission responsible for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Over the past year, we have carried out a broad consultation on a future maritime policy for the European Union. Coastal regions and the various industries that depend on the seas and oceans make a considerable contribution to Europe\u2019s economy and to the welfare of its citizens. Our main aim remains to develop an integrated approach that will provide a sustainable development of these activities, unleash the untapped potential from sea resources and promote synergies between the different relevant sectors. Particular attention will also be paid to the mitigation of the effect of climate change with, among others, the development of sea-based renewable energy and the prediction and mitigation of coastal erosion. Maritime regions and industries have much in common, and by working together, we can make a stronger contribution, anchoring Europe in the global market and enabling our maritime industries to create new, better jobs. During the OPEN DAYS we will present the broad lines of the EU\u2019s new maritime policies, while Europe\u2019s maritime regions will have the chance to share their ideas and experiences with each other. Health is vital not only for citizens, but for society as a whole. Good health remains one of the priorities not only of the European Commission, but also of regional and local authorities, who are at the forefront when it comes to policies in public health, food safety and animal health. The Commission\u2019s role in this area is to ensure that proper consideration is attached to health policy at all levels of European government, with the aim of striving for the best possible protection for citizens. With regional authorities, we want to ensure you have the tools to do the best for your citizens, and these OPEN DAYS provide you with the opportunity to fi nd out about the latest initiatives in the fi eld, and to talk directly to Commission offi cials working in the fi eld. J\u00e1n Figel\u2019 Member of the European Commission responsible for Education, Training, Culture and Youth Our future in a global economy depends in large part on the quality of our education and training systems, on our creativity, and on our capacity for innovation. Education and training are crucial for economic growth and, therefore, for creating both more and better quality jobs. There is a strong economic case for investing better and more in education and training. But the impact of education and training is not limited to the growth of Europe\u2019s GDP or a falling unemployment rate. The education and training is also vital for personal development and fulfi lment, for greater social inclusion and active citizenship. Our learning systems are essential to give everyone living in Europe the opportunity of participating in and of contributing in full to our societies. We are born as human beings, but we have to become citizens, personalities. Regions and local authorities are key players in the delivery of education and training, and so these OPEN DAYS offer them the opportunity to learn about new ideas and initiatives. Janez Poto nik Member of the European Commission responsible for Science and Research Research is Europe\u2019s passport to a successful future, but only if we maximise the benefi t we take out of research results, through innovation. The connections we need to do that start within regions, linking universities and research organisations with local enterprises. The Seventh Research Framework Programme, which started this year, will enable us to work more closely with the Structural Funds, to build on the research strengths of individual regions, and create the basis for developing knowledge more effectively. Every region, even the least developed, has strengths on which it can build, and at the heart of the knowledge economy is the ability to recognise and develop those strengths. OPEN DAYS gives us the opportunity to look at how individual regions are building on their own attributes to play their part in that knowledge economy.

        "8 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities Europe\u2019s rural areas \u2013 some 90% of the EU\u2019s territory \u2013 are the basis for much of the food we eat and a substantial share of the tourism income generated in our economy, and about half of Europe\u2019s population lives in rural areas. So regional development policies must pay suffi cient attention to the needs and specifi c conditions of rural areas. The Union\u2019s growth and jobs strategy is just as relevant to rural areas as populous urban areas, and the new Rural Development Fund as well as cohesion policy instruments fully recognise this. These OPEN DAYS will enable regions from across Europe to share each other\u2019s experiences and learn of the initiatives and tools which have contributed successfully to the development of rural areas. Mariann Fischer Boel Member of the European Commission responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development Andris Piebalgs Member of the European Commission responsible for Energy The future challenges to the European Union are great in the Energy fi eld \u2013 climate change, security of energy supply and competitiveness. The past year has seen the Union defi ning the answers to these challenges. Regions and local communities will play a critical role in its development, as renewable energy sources and energy effi ciency must contribute ever more to Europe\u2019s energy mix. There are enormous opportunities open to those communities and regions willing to embrace renewable energy sources and energy effi ciency, and our task is to work together at all levels so that we can meet our goals. During these OPEN DAYS regions will be able to share their ideas and experiences, and learn from each other\u2019s existing and planned strategies for renewable energy and energy effi ciency. Environment is perhaps the greatest example of a policy area in which individual action by one region or Member State can be negated by that of the neighbours. If we are to improve all our environments, coordinated action across the Union is essential. Regional and local authorities must be at the forefront of developing and implementing environmental protection tools and policies. And for those which seize the initiative, environmental technologies can offer a huge boost to the regional economy, creating jobs and prosperity alike. Visitors to the OPEN DAYS have a unique chance to learn about each other\u2019s environmental initiatives, and to discuss jointly with the Commission about future developments which can help us meet our ambitious environmental protection targets.

        "OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 9 Dimitris Dimitriadis President, European Economic and Social Committee Gerardo Galeote Quecedo Chairman, Committee on Regional Development, European Parliament The adoption of the 2007-13 Financial Perspectives and the new legislation adapting the Structural Funds, to meet the needs of the enlarged European Union, has meant signifi cant shifts in both priorities of cohesion policy and the way the new programming period affects the regional economies of Member States. The cohesion and solidarity principle are both an essential and strategic pillar of European integration. In this context, the EP has always stressed the role of regions and cities as key actors in the implementation of the renewed cohesion policy, trying to adapt the policy instruments to their needs and expectations in a process of bottom-up consultation and put in practice the principles of governance. So now it is up to our regions and cities to make it happen, keeping in mind that the key of the cohesion policy\u2019s success is co-operation, allowing steady exchanges of know-how and best experiences. I strongly believe that the OPEN DAYS 2007 will build on the experiences of previous years, and will give the participants the opportunity to participate in enriching exchanges of ideas and stimulating discussion, as well as to establish durable partnerships resulting in more sustainable development for our regions and cities. As a partner institution, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) takes great pleasure in supporting the Committee of the Regions\u2019 excellent initiative: OPEN DAYS \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities. The two Committees not only share the architectural landmark building which is the focal point of OPEN DAYS, but also their joint vocation as institutional consultative bodies at the European level advising the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. The EESC brings together in Brussels representatives of the various economic and social components of organised civil society. Its opinions refl ect a dynamic consensus between its three groups: employers, employees and various interests. As a forum for dialogue and consultation for civil society organisations across Europe, the EESC sees it as one of its primary tasks to bring the European Union closer to its citizens. The OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2018Making it happen: Regions and cities deliver growth and jobs\u2019 aim at this very target \u2013 I wish this event all success.

In 2006, the EIB lent some \u20ac 46 billion for key investment projects that helped implement priority EU policy objectives. High on its agenda are stimulating growth in regional development areas and supporting the Lisbon Strategy. In this context, fi nancing infrastructure projects, environmental protection, (sustainable) energy projects, as well as SMEs, are all crucial for Europe\u2019s future and at the heart of the EIB\u2019s activities. As in the past, the EIB actively participates in these OPEN DAYS. Please visit the EIB\u2019s stand, talk to the representatives, and fi nd out what the European Investment Bank as a fi nancial partner can do for projects in your city or region. Philippe Maystadt Chairman of the European Investment Bank Michel P\u00e9bereau President of the European Banking Federation I am delighted that the European Banking Federation is involved in the OPEN DAYS of the Committee of the Regions and the European Commission\u2019s Regional Policy Directorate General. Our Federation represents almost 5 000 European banks, large and small, retail and wholesale, several international groups and many national or regional entities. All share common ethical and corporate values which make them key actors in the economic life of their communities, at cross-border, national or regional level. I hope that the FBE\u2019s contribution to the OPEN DAYS will prove fruitful and rewarding for all participants. Jean Lemierre President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRD has invested more than \u20ac 14 billion in its ten countries of operations that became EU Member States since May 2004. In local and regional infrastructure, EBRD is at the forefront of innovative fi nancing in the public and private sectors. As a founding partner of JASPERS, with the European Commission and the EIB, EBRD is continuing to support project preparation in key areas such as national and regional transport networks, PPP, environmental services, public transport and energy effi ciency/renewable energy. Rapha\u00ebl Alomar Council of Europe Development Bank The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) has been dedicated by its statutes to social cohesion for more than 50 years. It has acquired a great deal of experience on social projects and has, since 1994, demonstrated its capacity to assist the new member countries on their way towards the European Union. Co-operation with the European Commission and other partners in Europe is a priority for CEB. For example, leveraging its experience in social housing and urban development, CEB signed, in 2006, together with the European Commission and EIB, a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding on urban renewal, which can be regarded as a fi rst step to set up the JESSICA initiative. We are looking forward to discussing these and other subjects during the OPEN DAYS 2007. COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 10 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 10 28/06/07 15:35:28 28/06/07 15:35:28 ",

Our members represent one of the largest networks of retail fi nancial services in Europe and are trustworthy and long-term partners of private clients and small and medium-sized enterprises. All our members have a strong regional focus, develop their own initiatives and work together with local authorities to stimulate local growth and jobs. I am convinced that the OPEN DAYS will provide an excellent opportunity to exchange experiences and create partnerships. The European Association of Co-operative Banks (EACB) is the voice of co-operative banks in Europe. With 60 000 outlets and 4 500 banks, co-operative banks (which are private banks) play a major role in the European Union\u2019s fi nancial and economic system. They have a long tradition in serving 140 million customers, mainly consumers, SMEs, retailers and communities. Through their business model based on democracy (60 million members), transparency and proximity, co-operative banks act as one of the driving forces of local and regional development and are catalysts for economic and social cohesion in Europe. In the light of their vocation to serve collectivities through their 720 000 employees and their involvement in local economy, co-operative banks are particularly glad and honoured to support again this year the OPEN DAYS initiative and are convinced that it will be a renewed success. The European Association of Public Banks (EAPB) represents fi nancial institutions, public banks, funding agencies, associations of public banks and banks with similar interests, and their specifi c tasks at the European level. EAPB members constitute an essential part of the European fi nancial sector, in which they play a decisive role, with a market share of approximately 15%. As the EAPB, on behalf of its members, is engaged in stimulating economic and social development, the EAPB supports the OPEN DAYS and is happy to actively take part in the thematic village \u2018Financial Engineering and Business Support\u2019.

This objective has been embraced in the new cohesion policy and now all actors involved have to make the best of the available funds. Companies are ready to set up public-private partnerships with local and regional authorities to contribute actively to enhance innovation and create jobs. The OPEN DAYS initiative offers an excellent opportunity for public and private investors to meet and fi nd the best solutions for regional development. Ernest-Antoine Seilli\u00e8re President of BUSINESSEUROPE Pierre Simon President of Eurochambres, the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry The Leitmotiv of this year\u2019s OPEN DAYS \u2018Making it happen: Regions and Cities deliver growth and jobs\u2019 corresponds very well to the Chambers\u2019 perspective, as it is at regional and local level that positive actions are implemented. As natural business partners of the regions, chambers are in the position to implement concrete actions for the benefi t of their business members. The European Chamber Manifesto, which has been endorsed by all European chambers, highlights positive actions on the ground in key fi elds of economic development such as entrepreneurship, training, innovation and internationalisation. Georg Toifl President of the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME) Even if the economy is into globalisation, business is still local. Production, services, consumption and jobs are where producers, clients and consumers are, and that is the local level. While keeping the global picture in mind we must never underestimate the power and importance of local and regional business for stabilising European society. Local business is mainly about SMEs. So let\u2019s keep the backbone of the European economy sound for Europe and its regions, its economy and its people. The OPEN DAYS contribute to that task which we support wholeheartedly.

This Forum provides an opportunity for assessing the EU cohesion policy, the new partnership principle and the fi rst phases of the implementation of the Structural Funds in the current programming period, considering in particular the contribution from the civil society sector to their effective operation and the synergies among the actors involved. The workshops will examine the main stages of Structural Funds operations (i.e. strategy setting, implementation and evaluation), the functioning of partnership and the three-way catalyst synergies at each stage. As an international non-profi t organisation which aims to alleviate poverty worldwide through the development of microfi nance, PlaNet Finance is delighted to be associated with OPEN DAYS 2007. PlaNet Finance contributes to economic growth and employment in the regions, especially through its active European network. In particular, PlaNet Finance France is leading the fi ght against unemployment in the disadvantaged French urban areas through several projects, which help micro-entrepreneurs set-up income-generating activities (\u2018Entreprendre en Banlieue\u2019 programme \u2013 \u2018start-up in the suburbs\u2019, and the solidarity venture capital company \u2018FinanCit\u00e9s\u2019). These programmes will be developed throughout all of Europe. It is my hope that OPEN DAYS 2007 will actively contribute to strengthening ties and sharing good practice experience, fostering economic development and poverty alleviation in Europe. Europe+ Foundation is an independent network promoting European attractiveness and competitiveness. Since 2003 it has organised the La Baule World Investment Conference, a platform for exchanging best practices and designing concrete proposals in respect of the Lisbon Agenda. Supported by the Commission and Parliament, Europe+ forms partnerships with public and private institutions, and works closely on innovation drivers with businesses, universities, political leaders, researchers, experts and journalists.

Opening Session The Opening Session on 8 October, 16.00-18.00, in the Charlemagne building, picks up the overall theme of the OPEN DAYS 2007. The objective is to have a closer look at what has happened during the programming process, and at how the regions and cities are delivering the Union\u2019s growth and jobs agenda through the new cohesion policy programmes for the 2007-13 period. The following speakers are expected to participate : \u2022 Danuta H\u00fcbner, European Commissioner for Regional Policy \u2022 Michel Delebarre , President of the Committee of the Regions \u2022 Francisco Nunes Correia , Portuguese Minister for Environment, Spatial Planning and Regional Development \u2022 Philippe Maystadt , President of the European Investment Bank \u2022 Ernest-Antoine Seilli\u00e8re , President of BUSINESSEUROPE \u2022 Jacques Attali , President of PlaNet Finance Keynote addresses will be followed by a roundtable debate, which will include representatives from the regional and local level and other European organisations.

It will address the future of EU cohesion policy, in view of factors such as the EU budget review, globalisation, climate change and demographic trends, and their impact on Europe\u2019s regions. Starting from the Fourth Cohesion Report, published in May 2007, and in the context of the public consultation which is running during the Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies, the OPEN DAYS offer the opportunity to discuss many specifi c aspects with stakeholders. The following speakers are confi rmed: \u2022 Michel Delebarre , President of the Committee of the Regions \u2022 Danuta H\u00fcbner , European Commissioner for Regional Policy \u2022 Gerardo Quecedo Galeote , Chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s Regional Development Committee The introductory speeches will be followed by a round-table debate with representatives and experts from other institutions or European organisations.

        "24 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities The Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 is the innovative concept at the heart of OPEN DAYS 2007 - European Week of Regions and Cities, the biggest event in the EU\u2019s regional policy calendar, co- organised by the Committee of the Regions and the European Commission\u2019s Regional Policy Directorate-General. The theme of this year\u2019s event, with a record 212 regions and cities taking part, is \u2018Making it happen: Regions deliver growth and jobs\u2019. For the second consecutive year, the programme will feature very strong involvement from the private sector. The Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 provides a state-of-the-art meeting place and networking opportunity for business investors and decision-makers from local and regional authorities. 5 000 participants getting connected Up to 5 000 participants are expected to visit the Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 including: elected politicians from regional and national authorities, MEPs, European Commissioners, offi cials from EU institutions and from regional and local administrations, representatives of the banking sector, public and private companies, business entrepreneurs and corporations. These guests will have the opportunity to discover the three distinct aspects of the Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 . Firstly , it will be a real caf\u00e9 , located in the Committee of the Regions\u2019 headquarters at 101 Rue Belliard, Brussels. The caf\u00e9 will be open for business on the evening of 8 October and will remain open during extended working hours for the following three days (until 11 October). Experts from the business and banking sector will have the opportunity to meet representatives from local and regional government informally over coffee or a drink to discuss ideas and plan further bilateral contacts. Private meeting rooms will also be available close at hand. Secondly , it will be the focal point of a major exhibition linked to the public-private partnership theme of the OPEN DAYS 2007. Partners will be invited to set up their stands in one of the following thematic villages : (cid:129) transport (cid:129) health (cid:129) environment (cid:129) research and innovation (cid:129) energy (cid:129) fi nancial engineering and business support (cid:129) knowledge society The partner regions and cities will showcase regional innovation, know-how and investment potential. At the same time, private companies, banking and fi nancial institutions will have an opportunity to introduce themselves and present the investment services they can offer to the EU\u2019s regions and cities. Trade organisations, employers\u2019 associations and NGOs will also have exhibition stands in the Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 area. The third aspect of the Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 is the programme of 47 seminars and workshops , focusing on the scope for investment in Europe\u2019s regions and cities. Each of these events will provide a snapshot of stakeholders\u2019 experiences in delivering the growth and jobs targets at the core of the EU\u2019s competitiveness strategy (also known as the Lisbon Strategy). Experts from the European Commission will be present to explain how the new cohesion policy rules for 2007-13 will work, how different European policies contribute to delivering the Lisbon Strategy, and how regions and cities can make the most of the programmes and policies on offer. The Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9 seminars will seek to provide concrete answers to questions such as: How can Europe\u2019s regions and cities make themselves more attractive for business, investment in innovation and job creation? How can they develop successful public-private partnerships? How can they foster inter-regional co-operation? What is the best way to invest in sustainable, environment-friendly technologies? The seminars are aimed at a wide range of stakeholders, including the business and fi nancial sectors, the offi ces of regions and cities, and representatives of the EU institutions.

        "Attracting investors: Regions and cities show how it works Strategies for attracting investors Attracting investors to provide sustainable growth and jobs across Europe\u2019s regions and cities is a common goal for public authorities, often based on the same key ingredients such as making improvements to the business climate or physical infrastructure. But despite these common factors, achieving growth is often reliant on local circumstances. Many parts of central and eastern Europe are trying to bring investment into areas which lack resources and have less obvious potential. Romania is encouraging investment into less-developed areas, the city of Lodz in Poland has developed a new \u2018city image\u2019 which is the focus of its marketing strategy for attracting foreign direct investment, and a co-fi nanced programme in Austria assesses what the inhabitants of smaller towns see as the key to the regeneration of their urban areas. What can be learnt from other regions\u2019 successful strategies for attracting investors? Are there any key ingredients? The Co-operation for success -partners will present some of their recipes and share their successes and diffi culties. Examples will include how to attract large international fi rms and discourage relocation; how to attract investment in new housing growth areas and how to strengthen long-term and sustainable attractiveness through regional marketing strategies. What are regions doing to attract investors? Five regions from four EU countries will present their strategies for co-operation between regional stakeholders, focusing on how to foster incoming foreign investment for innovation, sustainable growth and jobs. Experts from regional development agencies, associations of industrial entrepreneurs and regional authorities will promote best practices and investment opportunities. Businesses have particular needs if they are to establish operations in new places. An Italian model of benchmarking territorial performance is presented along with two case studies: from Slovakia, the case of a well-known industrial park and its effort to stimulate inward investment; and from Poland, the case of a special economic zone and its success in attracting major multinational companies. How can regions support the growth of their SMEs? Taking the fi ndings of the INTERREG IIIC \u2018E-Team\u2019 project as a starting point, leaders of nine European regions will debate European and regional policies for supporting SMEs, and how SME growth can be encouraged. Co-operation between leading multinationals and regions can bring benefi ts that support SMEs and citizens, create economies of scale and reduce regional disparities. In particular, this approach will promote better regional policy and signifi cantly contribute to improved knowledge transfer and innovation across the EU. How can investors be attracted to metropolitan areas? Five thought-provoking case studies of practice in the metropolitan regions of Stuttgart, Sofi a, Frankfurt Rhein-Main, Rhein-Neckar and Berlin-Brandenburg will be presented to stimulate discussion on this important issue. 09A01 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Attracting investment to challenged areas 09A02 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Ingredients for long-term attractiveness in regions and cities: Recipes for growth 09A03 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Regional assets and strategies to attract investors 09A09 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 SMEs\u2019 growth 09A04 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Bringing businesses to your territory 32 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 10A12 10-Oct \u2013 14.30 Sustainable economic development: A partnership between multinationals and regions 11A17 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 Regional investor services in metropolitan regions and areas COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 32 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 32 28/06/07 15:39:07 28/06/07 15:39:07 ",
        "Environment and climate change Climate change presents a double challenge today. First, severe climate impacts can only be prevented by early, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Swift transition to a low carbon economy is therefore at the heart of Europe\u2019s integrated climate change and energy strategy. Second, with climate change already happening, regions and societies Europe-wide face the parallel challenge of having to adapt to the changing climate conditions and their impacts. Adaptation action has become an unavoidable and indispensable complement to mitigation action. The effects of changing climate conditions are already signifi cant and measurable in Europe. No region or economic sector will be untouched. A pair of workshops will discuss what can be done to combat climate change and how to adapt to the changed conditions at regional level. The fi rst workshop will help regions to identify the best strategies to reduce emissions and will demonstrate how regional development can be made less carbon-intensive. The second workshop focuses on adaptation action and aims to support regional players in identifying specifi c vulnerabilities and adaptation actions. Early action will bring clear economic benefi ts by anticipating potential damage and minimising threats to ecosystems, human health, human development, property and infrastructure. Climate change is a threat as well as a challenge to regional development. The cross-border region Euregio Maas-Rhine is increasing co-operation in new energies to combat climate change as well as strengthening a new, strong and innovative entrepreneurship cluster. How are they doing it and what can be learned from other regions? Water is no longer just a resource but is becoming a competitive asset in its own right. Water is critical to quality of life in both coastal areas and those landscapes with lakes, rivers or canals. Discussions will raise awareness of regional policies that produce sustainable development in water-related activities in the fi elds of energy, biotechnology, knowledge economy and leisure. Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) ensure that the environmental consequences of projects are identifi ed and assessed before they are allowed to proceed. Developers will learn to carry out a good quality EIA process with particular attention paid to the types of projects which will receive signifi cant allocations in the 2007-13 funding period, especially in new Member States. Examples will include transport and energy projects. SMEs have a primary role to play in shifting Europe to more sustainable production and consumption patterns. For example, SMEs can improve their environmental management, take part in eco-labelling schemes and take advantage of \u2018green\u2019 public procurement policies to drive eco-innovation. Substantial European funding is available to help SMEs adopt a greener approach to business. How can capital regions and cities respond to major environmental challenges such as combating climate change, improving air quality, protecting biodiversity and ensuring sustainable waste management? A strategic and global approach is key to tackling these issues. Europe could become one of the world\u2019s leading hubs for knowledge and competitiveness in the fi eld of maritime and environmental safety. Local and regional best practices in Europe for attracting FDI, innovation, money and talents will be presented. The event will emphasise investors\u2019 needs and expectations and offer concrete recommendations. 11A19 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 Fighting climate change: Contribution of regions OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 33 11A24 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Climate change: Helping regions to adapt 09A07 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 New energy and climate change \u2013 European duty and regional responsibility 09A08 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Water ecosystems: assets for regional attractiveness 09A06 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Lessons learnt in environmental impact assessment and the way forward 09A10 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 Eco-effi cient SMEs: Environmental management, eco-label and green public procurement as a driver for structural changes 11A21 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Promoting sustainable development in capital regions and cities 10A15 10-Oct \u2013 17.00 Attracting FDI in maritime regions COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 33 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 33 28/06/07 15:39:11 28/06/07 15:39:11 ",
        "34 OPEN DAYS European Week of Regions and Cities \u2013 2007 Transport for development Improved transport infrastructure is one of the keys to faster and more sustainable economic growth. Cities need attractive and well integrated transport systems, able to respond to the needs of businesses and citizens in the 21st century, and the potential of regional airports should not be overlooked. Several sources of EU funding are available to support improvements to Europe\u2019s transport infrastructure. The challenge is to use these grants in the most effective way, by mobilising private capital in partnership with the public sector and also by deploying modern technologies. Such an approach makes more effi cient use of both new and existing transport infrastructures. A good example is co-fi nancing in public transport, not only for new investments such as metro lines but also for the upgrading, maintenance and operation of existing public transport systems. The cities of the new Member States, in particular, should not repeat the mistakes made elsewhere of scrapping existing public transport infrastructure such as tram networks. Regional airports can play a key role in attracting businesses to a region and a series of three workshops are devoted to exploring their potential for growth and job creation. The fi rst kicks off with a look at how regional airports are promoted at a local level. A fruitful relationship between local authorities and regional airports can lead to a win-win strategy for both. The workshop also looks at the best strategies for making airports more easily accessible for all users. How regional airports can secure investment and operate effi ciently is the topic of the second workshop. What funding options are there, how can EU policies support regional airports and should airport funding be public, private or mixed? The third workshop examines best practices in operational and commercial models for regional airports, including developing a business model, the feasibility of town airports and whether charter, regional or low-cost carriers are the most appropriate. 11A18 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 Bringing Europe closer together: New approaches to fi nance transport infrastructures 11A22 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Urban transport: EU policy and funding opportunities 10A13 10-Oct \u2013 14.30 How to promote regional airports at local level? 10A16 10-Oct \u2013 17.00 Securing investment and being effi cient 11A20 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 Operational and commercial models for regional airports: Best practices COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 34 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 34 28/06/07 15:39:12 28/06/07 15:39:12 ",
        "OPEN DAYS European Week of Regions and Cities \u2013 2007 35 Investment themes With the Internet now becoming the fi rst choice for many shoppers, how can consumer protection be assured in the globalised world of the online market-place? What are the implications for privacy, data protection and prevention of fraud? Do we need new protection mechanisms? In the near future, conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders may be detected long before symptoms appear. Treatments will be tailored to each individual and modifi ed in response to their effectiveness. Topics include genomics to assess risk factors in individuals, in-vitro diagnostics for earlier and more accurate disease detection and clarity, and in-vivo diagnostics to confi rm diagnosis and characterisation using imaging techniques. Early childcare benefi ts everyone: children, parents, employees, employers and the community as a whole. It makes both educational and economic sense and promotes social cohesion, yet demand exceeds supply almost everywhere in Europe and the role of employers is limited or non-existent. This workshop will explore a variety of models for effective fi nancing of early childcare services, seeking to demonstrate that investments in such services could have a positive effect on government revenues, even in the medium term. Lifelong learning is crucial for the realisation of the so-called knowledge society. It helps people to become more adaptable and to acquire new skills and knowledge, creating more informed and empowered workers, citizens and consumers. To be really effective, lifelong learning programmes and related investments should be based on stronger public-private partnerships: discussion will focus on the best practices and most interesting schemes in Europe. 10A14 10-Oct \u2013 17.00 Secure eShopping 10A11 10-Oct \u2013 11.30 Early health through innovative technology 09A05 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Promoting investments in universal high-quality childcare in Europe 11A23 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Investments in lifelong learning for building the knowledge society For more information and registration, access our website: www.opendays.europa.eu COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 35 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 35 28/06/07 15:39:14 28/06/07 15:39:14 ",
        "Proximity matters: Clusters and regional development Clustering for development Local clusters are now seen as powerful contributors to regional growth and employment. They are not the answer in all cases, but the creation of communities of interdependent businesses sharing support services and benefi ting from economies of scale is a priority in many regions. Whilst some support is available at European level, by their very nature, clusters rely heavily on the imaginative and energetic commitment of regional public bodies. Do clusters really foster jobs and growth? If so, what makes a successful cluster? Can the different cluster models be transferred or is a sectoral approach more effective? Best practices will cover approaches to developing regional clusters and how the regional public sector (including R&D) can be involved. Examples will include how SMEs have expanded their international trade and developed new and innovative products or services through cluster-based structures. Recent Community initiatives such as the establishment of the European Cluster Observatory and the launch of the European Cluster Alliance as well as a number of Community fi nancial instruments all aim to foster the development of strong world-leading clusters in Europe. The European Cluster Memorandum will pave the way for transnational cooperation to develop a common cluster agenda with a view to unlocking Europe\u2019s innovation potential. Capital regions and cities are motors of growth and play a key role in cluster development, so contributing to the EU\u2019s competitiveness. This seminar will provide the opportunity for an exchange of views and best practice on cluster development in relation to economic and regional development. It has a special focus on the questions of governance and co- fi nancing. Relevant case studies from the automobile, biotechnological and other sectors will be presented. The main objective of this seminar will be to introduce concrete examples and experience of clusters from different areas (one fi eld presented will be maritime clusters), bringing together representatives from local and regional authorities, universities and companies. The relationship between R&D, innovation and economic growth is not always clear, and frequently not linear. Examples include a textile and clothing cluster in Poland, a successful high-tech \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 cluster in Lithuania, and the \u2018innovation connectors\u2019 approach in the north-east of England which shows how deprived communities and local people can benefi t from science-based R&D investments in their area. What are the challenges to stimulating research and innovation in the regions? An Austrian example emphasises the importance of assessing the current level of innovation in companies and sectors, and what actions are needed, appropriate to different situations. A policy and management \u2018think-tank\u2019 in Piemonte in Italy looks at the relationships between supply and demand for research and innovation. A Danish project stresses the link between clusters and regional innovation levels, and looks at how potential clusters can be selected. In order to innovate successfully, SMEs frequently need to access know-how and skills which they don\u2019t have themselves and which they are not familiar with. One answer is to set up integrated innovation support services by developing public-private partnerships between complementary services grouped in \u2018regional innovation circles\u2019. The new Community framework for state aid for R&D and innovation will have implications for the fi nancing of these services by regional and local authorities. 36 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09B01 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Clusters: the solution for regional development? 09B04 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Transnational co-operation for world-class clusters in Europe 09B06 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Promoting clusters 09B07 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Cluster\u2019 building: the importance of regional networks 09B09 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Clusters based on R&D, science and technology 09B11 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 Stimulating innovation at regional level 09B12 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 Integrating innovation support services at regional level COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 36 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 36 28/06/07 15:39:18 28/06/07 15:39:18 ",
        "Clusters are going through a diffi cult phase, both due to increasing global competition and to their own structural limits: small companies, low technological innovation, scarce investment in R&D and operating in markets with low added-value. But case studies from regions in Italy and France show signs of lasting competitiveness, such as the willingness to reposition themselves in the market, to extend the value chain across international branches, and to bring together centres of knowledge with the major logistics systems. In Vienna, a life sciences cluster brings together universities, research institutions and businesses on the same site, benefi ting from joint planning and common activities. The Finnish \u2018triple helix\u2019 model is illustrated by a regional development corporation in the Helsinki region. And a logistics cluster in Leipzig builds on co-operation between local authorities, business, and higher education and research, drawing on the assets of a local media cluster which offers practical IT solutions to the logistics sector. Clusters in leading-edge technologies can act as a spur to regional development, both through increasing the productivity of existing companies and encouraging the setting up of new businesses. Although innovation depends on a company\u2019s internal capacity, it increasingly depends also upon interaction and the exchange of ideas, not just with universities, but also with customers, suppliers and competitors. Examples of clusters in aeronautics, cosmetics, ICT and pharmaceuticals will be presented. It is particularly challenging to bring different regional clusters into a new cross-border cluster. The border regions of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany have a number of well-functioning and successful cross-border clusters, especially in new materials. How can such clusters be established and strengthened? How can universities and entrepreneurs contribute to their development? What is the role of local authorities in implementing policies for structuring and developing clusters or local productive systems? The analysis will focus on the concept of clusters, the local policies supporting and structuring clusters, the local policies for improving the competitiveness of clusters, and the institutionalisation of clusters. The aim is to establish a set of criteria and guidelines for local authorities in order to develop policies to promote competitiveness and innovation through territorial clusters. Specifi c schemes and initiatives have been developed within EU programmes over recent years to foster co-operation between local and regional authorities, research institutes, universities and regional SMEs. What strategies can be developed at local or regional level to bring the research sector, public authorities and SMEs closer together? Attention will be given to specifi c schemes funded by the Structural Funds and the Seventh R&D Framework Programme.

        "Energy and the environment A common energy policy may be decided at European level, but its implications will be felt in the regions. Renewable and clean sources of energy offer opportunities for creating new businesses based on eco-innovation and sustainable development. Europe is on the way to establishing a common energy policy but how much uniformity in energy policy does Europe need? Some Member States believe that liberalisation and competition is the right way \u2013 others believe that protectionism and fi ghting for their own national interests is the better approach. Member States will have to choose between \u2018ownership unbundling\u2019 to force competition \u2013 the main focus of this workshop \u2013 or developing more and more complex national regulations. Sustainable development is closely linked to energy, and regional and local authorities are now widely recognised as key players in this sector. In 1994, the European Commission triggered a strategy to encourage decentralised players to promote energy effi ciency and renewable energies. The European institutions can set the framework but concrete implementation cannot be done from \u2018Brussels\u2019. Can we transform this emerging change into a real opportunity for competitiveness and sustainability? How can the development and utilisation of renewable energy provide growth, innovation and jobs in the regions? Regional showcases of successful energy strategies will serve as practical examples of how renewable energy contributes both to the objectives of climate protection and to the Lisbon agenda. Following the seminar, the \u2018idea seeks partner\u2019 event will offer the opportunity to establish new co-operation contacts. Regional clusters can boost innovation management by implementing a more integrated approach to innovation among SMEs. Continuous eco-innovation can save resources, reduce the impact on environment and health, attract investment and strengthen market position. Stakeholders from sectors in which eco-innovation plays a crucial role (eco-construction, eco- design, agri-food technologies, and marine and maritime technologies) will identify the factors of implementation and development of regional innovation policy open to external partners. Research is a crucial element of successful innovation, but turning this into a competitive advantage for regional businesses is the key. This seminar looks at the role of networks and partnerships in the renewable energy sector to make technology transfer a reality. Examples of technology transfer between research institutions and SMEs and from business to business will be presented, and obstacles to research-driven growth in the EU will be discussed. Europe will need clean coal technologies to meet future targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many regions use coal or lignite intensively for power generation and the future of these activities will depend on the availability of cleaner and sustainable technologies. Without more effi cient conversion of coal and without carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), the world will not bring climate change under control. Solutions developed for solid fuels could be easily adapted to natural-gas-fi red power plants. Renewable energies play a key role in delivering sustainable development. Often focusing on their own natural resources and indigenous strengths, regions are at the forefront of driving forward these technologies. In observing a multitude of renewable technologies, this seminar will demonstrate how regions are developing the necessary clusters and partnerships to stimulate innovation and to contribute to the creation of increasingly low- carbon regional economies. Energy effi ciency, use of renewable energy sources, sustainable urban transport and development all contribute growth and jobs, and improve the EU\u2019s energy security and its environment. Now that EU targets have been set, it is time for practical action at all levels, especially locally. Cities and regions can work together with private partners, NGOs, associations and universities, using Structural Funds and other public support and public- private partnerships in order to achieve their common objectives. 38 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09B03 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Market restructuring: EU energy policy \u2013 between unifi cation and regional distinctions 09B10 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Regions and local authorities: Sustainable energies in your hands 10B14 10-Oct \u2013 9.00 Energy activity, jobs delivery.

        "Healthcare New technologies hold out the prospect of better treatments for patients as well as opportunities for new and innovative companies. Co-operation between stakeholders at regional level can foster thriving and innovative business communities offering high-quality jobs in healthcare and the life sciences. This workshop will share information on developing innovative medical technologies and products through new research methods and generating more effective evidence-based strategies of health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis and therapy. It will also address challenges and opportunities for regions to access innovative technologies and knowledge on which new products and medical processes are based, and to support the creation of life-sciences clusters. Inequalities and ineffi ciencies in current health systems are revealed by important variations in outcomes between different regions within and between Member States. As there is a strong link between lifelong determinants of health and health disparities, the workshop will also be dedicated to promote healthy early learning and healthy behaviour. The combination of behavioural diffi culties and failure in educational programmes on healthcare issues are also associated with low levels of physical and mental health in adulthood. Remote patient management increases quality of life for patients and could help control the spiralling cost of healthcare delivery; however, there are some challenges to be solved before these benefi ts can be realised. Based on experiences gained in a number of regions, the workshop will seek to present effective ways of integrating remote patient management into existing care delivery structures. This workshop will explore and assess the existing capacity of public health systems and share information between regions on how to improve such capacities, especially in terms of healthcare workforce, public health laboratories/centres, health information systems, public health schools, etc. The aim will also be to encourage effective public health management as well as identify and disseminate good examples of partnerships between state, local and public health agencies. Who will take care of the millions of older citizens in coming decades? Many of tomorrow\u2019s older adults will enjoy good health and independence into old age. Others will live with chronic health conditions and many will rely on families and healthcare providers to manage as best they can. New models of care are slowly emerging that will address the complex needs of patients and their caregivers, while providing relief to the already-stressed traditional models of acute care. The latest information and communication technologies can be used to optimise clinical workfl ows throughout the healthcare systems to improve patient outcomes while reducing overall costs. A paradigm shift is needed \u2013 especially for chronically ill patients \u2013 not to act only if acute cases occur but to focus on preventing or shifting those events in time to increase quality of life. Greater focus must be given to prevention, early detection and continuity of care. The workshop aims at discussing the opportunities and challenges involved in the defi nition and implementation of clinical pathways in eHealth settings. What are the various experiences on the defi nition and implementation of clinical pathways? What are the major challenges in fi nancing and co-operation between the various institutes co-operating in the clinical pathways? What benefi ts are expected from managing chronic diseases through clinical pathways? What contributions can IT bring?

        "Maritime industries Europe\u2019s long coastline has given rise to many businesses and industries concerned with the sea. What common challenges do they face and how should policy-makers respond to their needs? The proposal of an integrated EU maritime policy, alongside wider debates on climate change and sustainability, has highlighted the role of the maritime sector in delivering growth and jobs. In this context, regional experiences will be shared on how to increase the competitiveness and economic development potential of our maritime regions \u2013 including attracting investment, clustering, and ports development. How can we optimise and coordinate maritime policies into one coherent policy that could secure Europe a high rate of productivity and growth? An outline of possible solutions for innovative collaboration between public and private sector will be presented, focusing on how the Community can achieve its social and environmental aims by stressing the importance and potential opportunities of renewable energy in coastal areas.

        "Tourism According to the Lisbon Strategy, tourism is one of the three economic sectors with the greatest potential for economic growth. It is seen as a major opportunity for job creation over the coming years, in particular in less developed and peripheral regions. However, ensuring that such development is sustainable will be a major challenge. Investment and training have created an accessible and sustainable tourism industry in several European regions while being part of a regional strategy for growth and jobs. This showcase will demonstrate successful tourism projects in Norway, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Estonia and Lithuania. Water is an essential asset to many cities and regions that depend on tourism for their economic livelihood, whether for cultural, aesthetic or historical reasons. These places must put water and coastal preservation efforts at the core of their regional development policies, particularly the construction of competitive and sustainable tourism clusters.

        "Spending it wisely: Public-private partnerships and fi nancial engineering Models of support How can micro-fi nance work in different contexts? There are various examples of adapting both the lending and the support methods to particular circumstances. These often include the question of guarantees and fi nancial capacity building. How can existing private sources of fi nance be tailored to the needs of disadvantaged groups in society? How can funding mechanisms be engineered so that they also meet the needs of people willing to become self-employed? ESF managers have experimented with different kinds of start-up funds and grants, simplifying and reducing delays and red tape and the use of the Structural Funds to explore fi nancial instruments which are particularly adapted to self-employed people, micro- enterprises and the social economy. SMEs and craft enterprises are the backbone of the European economy. Organisations representing SMEs will present examples of the need for European support for this vital sector. One outcome will be a list of suggested actions that the EU could take in collaboration with the regions to promote the future sustainability of small and craft businesses. Bringing new fi nance into healthcare presents both challenges and opportunities for regions. Based on experiences from countries/regions which have implemented healthcare schemes using innovative fi nancing models, this workshop will look at effective ways to achieve plans which are fi nancially sustainable in the long term, and associated with innovative incentives and reimbursement mechanisms at the point of care. Globalisation has accelerated the trend and pressures for SMEs to take a fuller part in international markets, rather than just by exporting. One of these is to participate in global supply and value chains, thereby learning to work closely with multinational enterprises (MNEs). This workshop will explore the ways in which both SMEs and MNEs can better exploit these opportunities and the support systems needed to facilitate wider, more open competition in this area. Micro-credit has the potential to enhance business creation, private sector development and growth, and also to contribute to social inclusion and job creation through self-employment. Dedicated to practitioners from regional development ministries or bodies, banks and civil society organisations, this workshops is intended to raise awareness on various issues related to micro-credit, and to allow for an exchange of good practices with a view to prepare for the implementation of a possible future action plan to develop micro-credit in Europe. The Unioncamere round-table will deal with economic change and look at how co-operation between regions, chambers of commerce and cities can be further developed in areas such as innovation, environment, mobility and energy in order to deliver growth and jobs. It refers to the Commission\u2019s \u2018Regions for economic change\u2019 initiative launched at the end of 2006 to support best practices among local and regional players in the modernisation of their economies and support for competitiveness towards meeting the Lisbon targets. What kind of support can investors expect from the EU and local authorities when considering investing in cities and regions? Case studies will highlight success stories of regional investment by companies from other countries as examples of how the internal market and EU regional policy can support economic growth and the creation of jobs. 42 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09C02 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 The role of micro-credit in promoting entrepreneurship and its effects on social inclusion 09C04 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 SMEs: keystones of Europe 09C05 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Innovative fi nancial models for healthcare optimisation and wealthier economy 09C06 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Internationalising the SME: The role of multinational enterprise/SME collaborative networks 10C09 10-Oct \u2013 9.00 Micro-credits for regional and local development 10C10 10-Oct \u2013 9.00/part 1 10-Oct \u2013 11.30/part 2 Regions and Chambers: Actors and networks for economic change 11C13 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 Investments opportunities in Europe \u2013 case study: Poland and Germany COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 42 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 42 28/06/07 15:39:36 28/06/07 15:39:36 ",
        "EU funding initiatives Three new initiatives have been launched by the Commission and its partners to promote investment in small businesses, urban areas and regional development. Improving sustainable access to fi nance for SMEs, including micro-businesses is a priority area of the renewed Lisbon agenda. This why the Commission has sought to introduce a cultural shift in how Structural Funds support is delivered, seeking to encourage recyclable forms of assistance and to move away from an exclusive reliance on grants. The JEREMIE fi nancial engineering Instrument has been developed together with the European Investment Bank Group with a view to combine with and to complement European grant fi nancing in the regions and to increase the availability of capital in Europe for new SME business formation and development. As JEREMIE introduces simplifi cation in the way Structural Funds operate, this seminar will be of interest to managing authorities who are looking forward to make the best possible use of this new facility in the programming period 2007-2013. Promoting sustainable investment, growth and jobs in Europe\u2019s urban areas is a priority area of the renewed Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. This why the Commission has sought to introduce a cultural shift in how Structural Funds support is delivered, seeking to encourage recyclable forms of assistance and to move away from an exclusive reliance on grants. The JESSICA fi nancial engineering Instrument has been developed together with the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Bank, and will offer the managing authorities of Structural Funds programmes the possibility to take advantage of outside expertise and to have greater access to loan capital for the purpose of promoting urban development. As JESSICA introduces simplifi cation in the way Structural Funds operate, this seminar will be of interest to managing authorities to help them make the best possible use of this new facility. JASPERS, a joint initiative of the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development seeks to pool expertise and resources in order to assist Member States in the implementation of cohesion policy. JASPERS will help the authorities in the preparation of major projects for submission to the Commission. This will be an opportunity for discussion between those involved in managing major projects at national and regional level and staff from the JASPERS headquarters and regional offi ces. Public-private partnerships Since the 1990s, many governments have sought to involve the private sector in the funding and delivery of public services by a variety of mechanisms known as public-private partnerships (PPPs). They are seen as bringing investment and expertise from the private sector into ventures which the public sector is unwilling or unable to contemplate alone. Public-private partnerships may be an appropriate method of fi nancing investment when there is signifi cant scope for involving the private sector, and it can also improve the quality of the implementation and subsequent management of projects. Cohesion policy programmes can support PPPs by providing fi nance and operational guidance. The co-operation between the European Commission and the European Investment Bank and other fi nancial institutions will provide valuable input. Experiences of PPP from the EIB and Structural Funds investments will be presented. At the heart of the relationship of the public-private partnership is the incentive/risk-sharing trade-off between private and public sector bodies and the different fi nancing possibilities. From Italy, we look at different models of PPP and identify some best practices. From Poland, the case of a public-private company delivering effi ciency and fl exibility in major infrastructure provision is presented. And from the Czech Republic, we look at how cities and regions are looking to use different models of PPP projects and at some of the negative and positive experiences. In the light of population growth, increasing industrialisation and climate change, it is essential that all parties work together to explore both policy and technical solutions to water sustainability. Practical examples of successful water conservation and reuse projects throughout Europe will be presented for both drinking and waste water.

        "Crossing borders: Co-operation and exchange of best practice supporting growth and jobs Structures for co-operation The EU offers many different programmes for supporting co-operation between regions, and these workshops report on experience and good practice from many parts of Europe. The new inter-regional co-operation programmes (INTERREG IVC) will be aimed mainly at exchanging good practice on two issues: innovation and the knowledge economy, and the environment and risk prevention. Information will be given on how multi-regional projects will be supported and how the programmes will be organised. Inter-regional co-operation can be organised in various ways, taking into account the challenges and opportunities of different cultural and administrative traditions. Participants will gain an insight into different ways to achieve concrete results from various multi-regional projects, including those in candidate countries as well as in old and new Member States, and will explore the effects of successful networking on competitiveness within the regions. The Greater Region is an institutionalised co-operation between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Lorraine, Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, Wallonia and the German-speaking community of Belgium. It promotes joint economic, social and spatial development, networking in culture, cultural heritage, science and education, and co-operation in culture, education, training and research, including coordination of academic curricula and the promotion of exchanges. By presenting some of the main cross-border projects of recent years, this workshop provides the opportunity to share and exchange experiences and best practices based on individual projects and joint strategies. What is the role of regional co-operation in achieving growth and creating jobs? What are the external and internal conditions? What has to be established on a regional level to achieve tangible results and what is the role of local and regional government? What impact does co-operation have on the regional labour market? How can regional authorities foster the innovation process in key industries to enhance competitiveness? What would a network of competences look like? What can cross-border co-operation achieve in response to border issues which pose either a threat to economic performance or an opportunity for maximising prosperity? This workshop will show the evolution towards \u2018mature co-operation\u2019, built on many years of tight and expanding collaboration. Case studies will look at political governance, transport, mobility of labour and knowledge, and the co-operation arrangements designed to address them. 44 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09D02 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 The interregional Co-operation Programme 2007-13: Outline and procedures 09D03 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Multiregional co-operation \u2013 recipes for success 09D06 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Marketing and developing locations in the Greater Region 10D12 10-Oct \u2013 9.00 Growth and jobs without borders 10D25 10-Oct \u2013 14.30 Co-operation for success COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 44 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 44 28/06/07 15:39:37 28/06/07 15:39:37 ",
        "Local authorities in France, Belgium and Spain have implemented several projects in co- operation with partners from different EU countries in the fi elds of environment, risk prevention and management, transport, innovation and integrated coastal management. Key factors for success include effective networking, political involvement, a common interest for co-operation, real added-value from co-operation and evaluation, and easy access to fi nancing. Euroregions are a key element in regional development policy and are one of the most innovative, most valued by border populations and most effi cient structures in terms of social and economic territorial development. Together with the EU\u2019s fi nancial instruments, Euroregions are one of the elements that have contributed most to spread the concept of Europe. Two workshops will discuss research by ESPON, the European Spatial Planning Observation Network. The fi rst illustrates how territorial patterns and development trends are pointing towards more territorial cohesion and improved competitiveness. The framework conditions and territorial advantages of a region are starting points for considering how to strengthen regional development through co-operation and attracting investors for which the specifi cities of an area can make the difference. The second workshop discusses contrasting territorial scenarios of likely futures for European regions until 2030. These show different pictures of the potential for networking, cluster- building and attracting investors. The application of the EU\u2019s territorial agenda may bring new opportunities for the attractiveness of many regions. The ESPON 2013 programme aims at investing more in partnerships and offers opportunities for co-operation between groups of regions sharing a specifi c need for knowledge. Many INTERREG projects are being developed across borders in a range of signifi cant themes. Examples include a project to shift freight traffi c from road to rail, how fi ve countries are collaborating in energy effi ciency and renewable energy, and the \u2018Wireless Cities\u2019 initiative. The workshop will also look at how links between regional clusters in the chemical industry can be strengthened by promoting intra-regional links between the industry, public authorities and the science community. Cross-border co-operation has a common aim of promoting increased business activity and creating jobs. A project in Slovakia aims to create a cross-border labour market with Poland. Co-operation in a borderland belt stretching from Germany to the Ukraine aims at socio- economic development respecting the natural and cultural heritage of the area. Helsinki and Tallinn are forming a cross-border capital region to create a common business environment and labour market.

        "The promise of the EGTC The European Grouping for Territorial Co-operation (EGTC) is a new legal entity for promoting cross-border, transnational and regional co-operation. It came into operation from 1 August 2007 and will be a framework for many kinds of co-operative ventures between authorities in the EU Member States. The EGCT allows local and regional authorities to create stable structures for territorial co-operation and has potential in fi elds such as transport, education, environment and healthcare. This workshop will discuss the implementation of the EGTC Regulation, illustrate grassroots co-operative initiatives and present EGTC activities by the Committee of the Regions, the EU and national institutions. The management of cross-border programmes has implications for the EGTC and the European Neighbourhood Partnership. Examples include the operation and effectiveness of Czech-German-Polish cross-border programmes and, from Hungary, how to assess the level of genuine local partnership in operations. The workshop will make the case for establishing a regional EGTC body. A presentation from Austria describes how cities along the river Danube (\u2018DonauHanse\u2019) are working together on a range of projects. The EGCT is designed to facilitate and promote cross-border, transnational and regional co- operation between authorities in Member States, regional and local entities. Its infl uence in instances of inter-regional co-operation already in place and the novelties it brings will be explained and discussed through the experience of the EGCT Galicia-Norte de Portugal, which builds on one of the most successful cross-border co-operation schemes in the EU. The EU and its neighbours Regional co-operation does not end at the EU\u2019s borders. Many schemes are helping to build links with neighbouring countries and regions. A well-functioning transport system connecting the EU with neighbouring countries is essential for sustainable economic growth. Improving the major trans-European transport axes would benefi t all, especially in the eastern external border regions. This workshop will exchange best practice and explore the infrastructure projects and innovative measures aimed at facilitating safe and sustainable development on both sides of the border within the European Neighbourhood Policy. Two seminars look at building co-operation with the EU\u2019s neighbours. First, how is it possible to create a bridge between European regions and the pre-accession countries? The seminar will discuss a new model for growth and jobs, crossing geographical borders while opening social, cultural and economic borders, illustrated by the experience of project partners. This second seminar will discuss future cross-border partnerships. The peripheral Mediterranean regions and cities have great potential for growth and development. How can the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), aimed at building cross-border co-operation, help to attain the goals of the new Lisbon agenda? How can partnership around the Mediterranean help to shorten cultural and social distances? The eastern border of the EU stretches 5,500 kilometres from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean, involving 41 regions on the EU side alone. These regions share similar challenges which differ from other EU regions and their solutions require specifi c measures and new approaches. Most are less developed but have the potential to become regional poles of innovation. Many have already implemented successful innovative actions and effective policies to enhance competitiveness. 46 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09D08 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 EGTC: from regulation to its implementation 09D09 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 Structures for managing cross-border development 10D14 10-Oct \u2013 9.00 The European Grouping of Territorial Co-operation: Exchange of fi rst experiences 10D22 10-Oct \u2013 11.30 Transport across external borders \u2013 challenges and solutions 10D23 10-Oct \u2013 11.30 Extending European borders: How can IPA and EGCT support the new territorial cross-border co-operation? 10D30 10-Oct \u2013 17.00 A bridge from the Mediterranean basin to the neighbourhood policy: the new perspective of territorial co-operation in the Free Exchange Area (ENPI) 11D39 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Competitiveness and innovation in the Eastern External Border Regions COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 46 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 46 28/06/07 15:39:46 28/06/07 15:39:46 ",
        "Sectoral studies Regional co-operation is often most effective when focused on shared problems in a very specifi c sector of the economy. Nine workshops are devoted to the creative sector, maritime industries, healthcare and tourism. Two workshops will examine the role of the creative industries in the European economy. Regions use different approaches to identify, analyse and map the economy of the sector. In this workshop, new approaches for supporting SMEs and other players in the creative sector will be presented with examples from the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden. The speakers will highlight the potential of this new business sector for creating more jobs in the future. The creative industries are a fast-growing business sector whose potential remains largely unrecognised in many European regions. Some regions have taken initiatives in this sector, although efforts have been largely isolated so far. This workshop will discuss problems and showcase best practices from partner regions in the Netherlands, Finland and Romania where co-operation in different sectors is leading to innovative new concepts. How can maritime regions face the future challenges of globalisation and other economic changes? This workshop will lay down best practices on staying competitive by stressing the role and potential synergies between the private sector and local authorities, as well as between research centres and companies, at local, regional and national level. Examples come from Finland, Poland and Norway. This the fi rst of two workshops which will tackle aspects of boosting growth and competitiveness in maritime activities, in accordance with a sustainable development model, through the exchange of experiences among different regions. Examples come from the Basque Country, Cantabria, West Ireland and Basse-Normandie. The second workshop aims to explain the new lines of action of the EU\u2019s maritime policy and to exchange experience on boosting regional competitiveness with examples from Cantabria, Basse-Normandie, Merseyside, Azores and Aquitaine. This workshop will help regions design their healthcare assessment model to improve the delivery and organisation of health services (chronic and home-care, out-patient, new specialised hospitals, etc.), set up innovative technology and process-optimisation to support changes, look at new fi nancing models, adapt reimbursement policy and rules to the new healthcare infrastructure, and set up information and training for healthcare professionals. Cross-border co-operation for healthcare can be fostered by setting up common strategies and networks as an added-value to complement regional investments in this area. This would help increase access to safe, high-quality health services, help health systems to remain sustainable and improve their effectiveness for the benefi t of patients. The Energy Policy for Europe (EPE) aims to ensure Europe\u2019s competitiveness and the availability of affordable energy while promoting environmental sustainability and combating climate change. We can move to a low-carbon economy by developing renewable energy and by the application of new technologies for a better and greener use of indigenous energy sources. Examples from the private and public sectors illustrate how regions are meeting the challenges set out in the EPE. Tourism plays an important role in the development of the vast majority of European regions. The seminar will compare policies and practices on sustainable tourism within the partner territories and discuss horizontal aspects and specifi c challenges. Regional as well as trans- regional experiences will be presented. The discussion will feed into the proposal for a European Agenda 21 for tourism.

        "Cities and urban regions Cities and metropolitan areas all over Europe offer similar opportunities and face similar problems. Formal partnerships can help them share best practice and learn from each other. Partners from the Baltic Sea region will share experience and best practice on co-operation between the region\u2019s engines of growth to create awareness of the benefi ts of metropolitan partnership in promoting innovation. The workshop will contribute to a shared learning experience among \u2018triple-helix\u2019 partners \u2013 cities, entrepreneurs and universities. Capital regions and cities face big problems related to social disparities. The seminar will focus on how regions and cities can respond effectively to this challenge. In this way, it will look at the strategies developed in order to improve skills and make them match the needs of the regional and local labour markets and the way the European Social Fund can contribute to this. Since the fi rst Euroregions were created more than ten years ago, they have produced a considerable amount of good practice. Experience shows how cross-border co-operation has become essential for people living in these areas. Dissemination of good practice in cross- border co-operation and its impact on citizens\u2019 lives gives a different and closer image of Europe. Local and regional players can benefi t from these experiences to make Europe more visible to their citizens. Most cities with high unemployment have areas where unemployment rates are at least double the city average, compounded by poor housing, poor environment, poor health, poor education, few job opportunities and high crime rates. The URBAN and EQUAL Community initiatives have been testing new ways to remove barriers to employability, social inclusion and investment in such areas. How can metropolitan areas co-operate to support growth and jobs? Five thought-provoking case studies of practice in the metropolitan regions of Berlin-Brandenburg, Oradea, Frankfurt Rhein-Main, Stuttgart and Nuremberg will be presented. Mobility and social inclusion Regional co-operation is not just for the benefi t of those at the top of the economic tree. Many projects are studying how to bring the fruits of co-operation to the disadvantaged and socially and economically excluded. Structural changes may have major consequences for workers, whilst workers can contribute to the positive management of changes. That is why the European Social Fund promotes the increased adaptability of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs. On the basis of good practice examples the workshop will discuss possible strategies for managing change, including: innovative anticipation tools, preparation of territories and sectors (i.e. lifelong learning), and accompanying measures (i.e. support for alternative employment, jobs and business creation plans). More than 100 pilot projects in Europe have tested new approaches to resettlement support, aftercare or assisting inmates while in prison, so that offenders are empowered and prepared to play a more positive part in society and in the labour market on their release. Some relate to the management of change in prisons, the introduction of quality systems and a more proactive attitude to rehabilitation. Others are concerned with new forms of education and training. Many involve opening prisons to agencies and individuals, including employers, so that released offenders can play a more positive role in society. 48 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09D01 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Boosting innovation through metropolitan partnership 10D18 10-Oct \u2013 11.30 Implementing jobs and skills strategies in cities and regions 10D24 10-Oct \u2013 11.30 Good practices of co-operation among European cities 09D10 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 Social and economic integration of deprived neighbourhoods and disadvantaged groups in urban areas 11D40 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Metropolitan regions and areas together for growth 09D05 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Regional strategies for innovative and social inclusive restructuring 09D07 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 (Ex)-offenders: Effective resettlement or possible re-offending?

        "How can professional training be used as a tool for breaking borders? One example is a project to train a labour force for the Kechnec industrial park situated on the Slovak- Hungarian border. In another, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria are co-operating on a multinational school for the construction industry, whose qualifi cations are recognised in all EU countries. How can the European Social Fund be used to manage migration and facilitate social integration? The focus of the presentations will be on strategies and actions in integrating migrant populations and ethnic minorities through exploiting the huge potential of this cultural and social diversity. It addresses players at regional and local level working on these issues and interested in sharing their experiences. Social enterprises can provide an excellent response to the problems of structural change, unemployment, migration and depopulation. This workshop brings together the insights, lessons and good practice of Member States and regions in supporting the set-up and development of social enterprises as a tool for integrating disadvantaged people in a local development context. Around 300 pilot projects in the EQUAL Community initiative have been trying to unlock the entrepreneurial potential of ethnic minorities, women, young people, older workers, people with disabilities and those living in deprived areas. Priorities included promoting entrepreneurship in schools and communities, access to micro-fi nance, integrated and inclusive business-support itineraries, entrepreneurial competences, and building sustainable networks and linkages to the drivers of growth. More than 350 pilot projects under the EQUAL initiative have tested new approaches to combat discrimination against immigrants and ethnic minorities in the EU labour market. They include infl uencing public attitudes and involving the media in public awareness and anti-discrimination activities; changing the mindsets of employers in favour of diversity; and helping employment and training organisations to better understand and cater for people from different countries or cultures. The European Social Fund promotes initiatives to keep older people in employment, such as improved access to training and more fl exible ways of organising work. This workshop will discuss examples of good practice which could be applied elsewhere. Future networking opportunities will be presented for regions and Member States interested in inter-regional and transnational co-operation as means to strengthen their initiatives on active ageing.

        "Checking delivery: How the new programmes are implemented The Greater Region brings together the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Lorraine, Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, Wallonia and the German-speaking community of Belgium. The challenge for the new Structural Funds programming period is to evaluate the experience of co-operation in INTERREG III C and to further defi ne co-operation within the new Objective 3 in the Greater Region. Examples of co-operation and \u2018lessons to be learned\u2019 will be discussed, as well as new instruments such as the EGTC. In 2007-13, EU regional policy and the Structural Funds will increase and improve investment in research and innovation, and enhance synergies with other EU policies and instruments. Priority will be given to strengthening co-operation between businesses and public research, by supporting the creation of regional and trans-regional clusters \u2013 in particular favouring SMEs \u2013 and by supporting capacity-building in research, including information and communication technologies, research infrastructure and human capital. These two workshops will present examples from national and regional innovation programmes. Partnership in the EU Cohesion Policy and civil society\u2019s involvement in the determination of development strategies are part of a wider debate concerning citizens\u2019 participation in the democratic functioning of the EU. What are the reasons for the set of practices and models of participation currently used in the EU and how can civil society organisations contribute to the policy-making process? Because partnerships can take so many forms, refl ecting different administrative and legal structures across Member States and regions, experts often argue that the best approach is to compare partnerships in operation. A number of examples will be presented in an \u2018ideas factory\u2019 exploring the range of instruments which exist to make partnerships work. How are local authorities involved in the programming and the implementation process of Structural Funds, especially in those programmes contributing directly to territorial competitiveness? Analysis and debate will be based on experiences of local involvement in 2000-06 programme frameworks, and the active involvement of that administration level in the current operational programmes 2007-13. A climate which promotes the production, dissemination and use of new knowledge is the best way to secure competitive enterprises and high quality jobs. Supporting businesses, in particular SMEs at regional level, is a priority in many national and regional cohesion policy programmes. In these two workshops, managing authorities from different Member States will present examples from national and regional business support and SME programmes. Engaging and utilising the skills and experiences of all principal stakeholders is key to the successful design, management and delivery of operational programmes. In Puglia in Italy, the regional programme has decentralised management in ten strategic areas. In Merseyside in the UK, NGOs have a central role in the social and economic development of the most deprived areas. And a public-sector fi nancial institution in France has taken over the role of certifying authority for the Territorial Co-operation Objective programmes. What is the role of regional development agencies in fostering regional growth and development? This workshop will address the common tasks of the agencies, review recent developments and highlight some success stories initiated with the help of these agencies. Furthermore, it is about creating networking opportunities, sharing experiences and exchanging views and ideas between the regional development agencies present at the Investors\u2019 Caf\u00e9. Evaluation actions are essential since they allow for refl ection on the strengths, weaknesses and results of partnership activities. They also feed back into earlier phases of the Structural Funds process by improving the context in which policies are discussed as well as the implementation of projects on the ground. This session will therefore focus on methods to evaluate partnerships and their potential added-value and multiplier effects. 50 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 09E01 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Structural Funds as a motor for cross-border co-operation 09E02 + 09E07 9-Oct \u2013 9.00/part 1 9-Oct \u2013 11.30/part 2 Implementing research and innovation at regional level 09E03 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Partnerships: Their role in framing strategies 09E06 9-Oct \u2013 11.30 Partnership: Making it happen \u2013 How the Structural Funds are implemented 09E08 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Local authorities in the programming and implementation of Structural Funds 09E09 + 09E13 9-Oct \u2013 14.30/part 1 9-Oct \u2013 17.00/part 2 Implementing business support schemes at regional level 09E10 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Partnerships in action 09E11 9-Oct \u2013 14.30 Networking for regional growth: Meeting of the regional development agencies at the OPEN DAYS 09E14 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 The added-value of partnership: Looking at evaluation results COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 50 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 50 28/06/07 15:39:52 28/06/07 15:39:52 ",
        "An interactive \u2018market place\u2019 of project ideas and best practice will illustrate how EU funding programmes are being used to attract investors, support clusters, forge public-private partnerships and exchange best practice. It will identify opportunities for future joint working through the European Regions Research and Innovation Network (ERRIN) network and look at how regions can use other programmes to bring in funding from the private sector. It will also discuss how different sectors can work together to transfer knowledge and support innovation. The implementation and modernisation of transport systems at EU, national, regional and local level play an important role in the new period of cohesion policy programmes, especially in the convergence regions. In these two workshops, managing authorities from different Member States will present examples from all three levels. The purpose of this workshop is to examine the main results already achieved by the creation of Euroregions involving Balkan and EU regions. It will investigate the opportunities given by the new EGTC regulation, in force since 1 August 2007. What are the legal bases and the aims of Euroregions and what are their advantages and disadvantages in fostering collaboration among regions? Examples include the Adriatic Euroregion and the INTERREG AdriEurOP project. How can the new Structural Funds and other thematic programmes be best used to support regional development and competitiveness and drive regional innovation? Using clusters as a case study, the workshop will explore how the European Regions Research and Innovation Network (ERRIN) can support a strategic approach to regional development, linking the implementation of regional, national and European funding programmes and building on experiences of the previous programmes. In October 2007 most of the operational programmes of the participating conglomerate regions for the 2007-13 funding period will have been approved, or be close to approval, by the European Commission. New and innovative tools for regional development in the new operational programmes will support the objectives of the Lisbon strategy. Presentations will showcase new and innovative schemes across conglomerate partners including themes such as innovation, SME support and venture capital. Investments in energy and environmental infrastructure and environmental technologies can ensure the long-term sustainability of economic growth, decrease external costs to the economy and stimulate innovation and job creation. Future cohesion programmes will seek to strengthen potential synergies between environmental protection and growth. The new generation of cohesion policy programmes will address these issues. In these two workshops, examples from national and regional programmes will be presented by managing authorities from different Member States. Examples from Estonia and Lithuania will illustrate the importance of communication and information fl ow in the implementation of Structural Funds projects. Topics include how to ensure high awareness of the Structural Funds, the importance of networking and sharing know-how, how to organise nationwide campaigns, how to get the right message across, how to set up a working information system and make the most of it, how to ensure transparency and reliability and how to set up an effi cient system and keep it. How can project cycle management (PCM) contribute to sound project and programme planning and management? Representatives of managing authorities, regional implementing bodies, project managers and national evaluators will showcase their successful experiences in applying PCM at project and programme level. Speakers will provide such evidence for the method\u2019s quality assurance criteria: relevance, feasibility and sustainability of the interventions funded.

        "In Poland, the integrated regional programme (IROP) has given way to 16 individual regional programmes. A case study from the Slaskie region describes the implementation and management structure of the regional operational programme. From Spain, we look at the key elements of the SWOT analysis and the objectives of the Castilla-La Mancha regional programme. Catalonia has a new (though smaller) regional competitiveness programme with emphasis on Lisbon objectives and a possible new mechanism for increased involvement of the provinces. The new ESF operational programmes in Member States envisage transnational and inter- regional co-operation in line with the provisions of the ESF Regulation. Several forms of exchange and co-operation will be presented and discussed. Selected regions and Member States will present their strategies and implementation arrangements for transnational and inter-regional co-operation. The new programming period for the Structural Funds will see changes for second level controllers and audit authorities. Major questions concerning audit approach, audit planning, audit implementation and documentation, reporting analysis of fi ndings will be discussed and various audit approaches assessed for different types of programmes. This workshop looks at the assets and objectives of the new approach to rural development, including the state of play of the programmes\u2019 approval with a special focus on co-operation and networking at national and European levels. The current Structural Funds programming period includes risk prevention among its priorities, and coastal management is one of the selected themes for the \u2018Regions of economic change\u2019. Adaptation to risks is also being developed in the context of the EU\u2019s future maritime policy. An EU strategy on disaster prevention is included in the Commission\u2019s 2008 work programme, where the aim is to take stock of diverse experiences with risk management in very exposed coastal regions. This workshop will look at experiences in implementing the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive adopted in 2001, in view of its further application in the 2007-13 programming period. It should refl ect on the success of the Directive\u2019s application, as well as presenting a scoreboard of environmental integration in the operating programmes. European Social Fund The European Social Fund (ESF) is designed to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by helping people to improve their skills and job prospects. What does partnership actually mean within the context of an ESF programme? What benefi ts can partnership offer, both strategically and operationally? What are the options for when and how partnership might be promoted in an ESF programme? And what are the key considerations to take account of before embarking on partnership? Gender equality is a binding objective of the European Employment Strategy, and since the mid 1990s gender mainstreaming has been the method adopted by the EU to achieve it. This workshop will focus on gender mainstreaming in regional employment and inclusion policies, as well as capacity-building in relation to structures to promote and facilitate gender mainstreaming. Good practices will demonstrate how the infrastructure and strategies can promote and achieve gender equality. Social innovations facilitate the modernisation of the economy and underpin and stimulate the reform of employment and social inclusion policies and actions. What does innovation actually mean within the context of an ESF programme? What benefi ts can innovative actions offer, both strategically and operationally? What are the key considerations to take account of before embarking on the support of innovation? 52 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 11E31 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 New programmes for Spain and Poland 11E34 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Transnational and interregional co-operation: A mechanism to improve the quality and effectiveness of the European Social Fund 2007-2013 11E33 11-Oct \u2013 9.00 Financial Control 2007-2013: The new requirements 11E37 11-Oct \u2013 11.30 Rural Development Policy 2007-2013 10E24 10-Oct \u2013 14.30 Adapting to the risks and impacts of climate change: lessons from Europe\u2019s coastal zones 10E25 10-Oct \u2013 17.00 Experience with implementing the SEA Directive for 2007-13: a preliminary assessment 09E04 9-Oct \u2013 9.00 Working in partnerships to foster employment and social inclusion 09E05 9-Oct \u2013 09.00 How to implement a gender mainstreaming approach into regional development policies 09E15 9-Oct \u2013 17.00 Supporting innovative actions to underpin reforms and organisational change COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 52 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 52 28/06/07 15:39:54 28/06/07 15:39:54 ",
        "This workshop will share new approaches to ensuring quality in ESF programme management, such as CAF, ISO 9002 or Project Cycle Management, and provide an opportunity for learning from the successes and failures of others. It is addressed to Structural Funds programme managers, in particular from the ESF, interested in ensuring delivery of results that contribute to programme objectives. It will focus on the needs of the ultimate benefi ciaries, real involvement of social partners and relevant NGOs, relevant skills of ESF managers, and simple and robust administrative procedures and routines. Links between ESF and the European Employment Strategy have been reinforced so that the ESF can contribute more effectively to the objectives of this strategy. Inclusion and employment strategy are key elements for a successful achievement of the Lisbon Strategy. At regional level, local authorities are in charge of inclusion and have therefore to show their capacity to identify key actions within their own strategy, to make sure they reach a high rate of access to employment. They also have to demonstrate their capacity to manage ESF programmes effi ciently. The ESF will support adaptability for workers and companies, improvement of education and training systems, access to employment and social inclusion. In new Member States, the ESF will also support the development of institutional capacity and the effi ciency of public administrations at national, regional and local level. Examples from France and Spain will be presented. Synergies between ESF, rural development measures and environment policy are needed more than ever. The Pomeranian region of Poland brings the example of the regionalised ESF and the push to involve the maximum number of local players. In the Czech Republic rural development is to be dealt with within the Structural Funds programmes and the new EAFRD- fi nanced Rural Development Plan. In the Marche region of Italy the Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment Directive has been applied to the regional operational programme. The demographic challenge and policies for active ageing has come to the top of the employment and economic policy agenda. The ESF promotes initiatives to keep older people in employment, such as improved access to training and more fl exible ways of organising work. This workshop will discuss good practice from pilot projects that could be applied elsewhere, and offers future networking opportunities for regions and Member States that are interested in interregional and transnational co-operation as a means to strengthen their initiatives on active ageing. Urban issues Towns and cities have particular problems that can be tackled with support from the Structural Funds. Municipalities in Estonia and Latvia have made the most of Objective 1 funds, from advancing their strategic planning and project presentation capacity to upgrading their fi nancial management and project management skills. Small or medium-sized towns have implemented projects under the European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund such as innovative experience in tourism development, and the contribution of street infrastructure improvement to the overall development of the small urban area. Based on experience with the URBAN Community initiative in previous programming periods, the \u2018urban dimension\u2019 will form part of the mainstream programmes under the convergence and regional competitiveness and employment objective in the 2007-2013 period. The Commission will present an assessment of the national strategic reference frameworks and the operational programmes, including case studies from different Member States. The assessment of life in European cities has been subject of the urban audit carried out on behalf of the Commission\u2019s Regional Policy DG. In these two workshops, fi ndings of recent surveys will be presented and recommendations will be discussed with representatives from other public and private institutions.

        "The international dimension of regional policy For the fi rst time, this year\u2019s OPEN DAYS will offer an international platform for exchange and debate on regional policy. In a special section, experts from third countries and international organisations will discuss the approaches of the EU and other world regions to enhanced regional convergence and competitiveness. Since May 2006, the European Commission\u2019s Regional Policy DG has had a \u201cstructured dialogue on regional policy\u201d in place with China, and since May 2007, a similar dialogue has been established with the Russian Federation. Both aim at promoting mutual understanding and information on issues such as policy development, implementation and governance. In this context, two seminars at the level of ministers and experts will be held with China on 8 October, and with Russia, China, Brazil and other interested regions, countries and international organisations on 9 October. Building on a fi rst seminar held in May 2006 in China, this seminar will look at the issue of regional disparities in the EU and China, the impact and added-value of EU regional policy, recent experiences in regional policy in China, and trends and challenges ahead. In two workshops in the afternoon, classifi cation and defi nition of regions, and multi-level governance and partnership arrangements in regional policy will be discussed. This seminar offers a platform for exchanges on regional policy in the light of the global challenges which EU and non-EU countries as well as international organisations face. Based on the existing co-operation agreements with China and Russia, representatives from Brazil and experts from other regions, countries, international organisations and the academic world are expected to discuss questions related to regional strategies and programming; innovation and regional development; capacity-building and governance; urban-rural development; sustainable development; and fi nancial engineering. These will be discussed in parallel workshops following an opening session. The seminar will conclude with a fi nal plenary session. 54 OPEN DAYS 2007 \u2013 European Week of Regions and Cities 08F01 8-Oct \u2013 09.00-16.00 Second EU-China Regional Policy seminar 09F02 9-Oct \u2013 09.00-18.00 Regional Policy in a global perspective For more information and registration, access our website: www.opendays.europa.eu COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 54 COR 7 0100_programme_final.indd 54 28/06/07 15:39:55 28/06/07 15:39:55 ",
