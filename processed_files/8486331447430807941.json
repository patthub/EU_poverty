        "5 FOREWORD Natural resources are increasingly at risk due to fac- tors such as climate change, demographic and econo- mic growth, political instability and forced migration. With globalisation, these exacerbated risks place ad- ditional pressure on resources and, through them, on the economies of affected and neighbouring countries. The greatest challenges to development and coopera- tion include the identification of appropriate and timely adaptation measures in this continuously changing environment. Other challenges are the establishment of multi-sectorial interlinkages towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) plus tar- gets in line with the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In addressing these challenges, the European Union (EU) has long recognised the importance of the nexus between water, energy, food and ecosystems (WEFE). The 2017 European Consensus on Development un- derlines the EU commitment to support an integrated approach that concretely addresses the most relevant interlinkages between land, food, water and energy. If appropriately taken into consideration, these inter- linkages can increase efficiency, reducing trade-offs and building synergies while improving governance across sectors. In 2015, the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-Ge- neral for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO), together with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, launched the \u201cNexus Dialogues\u201d programme. This aims to sup- port the development of national and regional poli- cy recommendations that take into account the links between the WEFE sectors. The European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC), which is strongly engaged in WEFE projects to inform the efficient implementa- tion of sustainable growth measures, provides impor- tant scientific support to this programme. One such support is this Position Paper, which is the result of discussions and experiences shared by univer- sities, international organisations and European Com- mission experts on WEFE. It highlights the importance and advantages of the WEFE Nexus as an approach and methodology in EU development cooperation. The studies presented (whose scope ranges from na- tional to regional and transboundary levels, including rural and urban contexts), provide valuable examples to help the EU and our partners make informed de- cisions when operationalising the WEFE Nexus. They show that the Nexus approach ensures a more inte- grated and sustainable use of resources that goes beyond traditional silos and is applicable at different scales. This is particularly relevant in an increasingly globalised world where collaboration must be more than just a buzzword: it is a common need.

        "Position Paper on Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8 1. BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND TARGET AUDIENCE The Nexus concept has become widely used in the in- ternational development community in recent years, not least since the Bonn 2011 Nexus Conference. While the Millennium Development Goals did not include a goal on energy and had no focus on the WEFE Nexus, the global development policy context has significantly changed with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015), the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (2015), the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Fi- nancing for Development (2015), and the New Urban Agenda (2016) that underline the importance of policy coherence and integrated approaches across traditional development sectors. Current EU development policy provides a general frame- work and background that justifies a Nexus approach and methodology. Consequently, the New European Con- sensus on Development: \u201cOur World, our Dignity, our Fu- ture\u201d (June 2017) emphasises an integrated approach to development and strongly supports the 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted in September 2015 as a global framework for sustainable development action. The 2030 Agenda itself emphasises an integrated approach that can fa- cilitate a Nexus methodology. As stated by the DEVCO Director General Stefano Manservisi in an interview with DEVEX on 14 June 2018: \u201cThe SDGs are obliging us to work in an integrated way and not in silos\u201d . As described in Section 2 of this document, the Nexus approach has evolved in recent years and can be de- fined in different ways. DG DEVCO supported work on the Nexus originally addressed the energy-water-food security (WEF) Nexus, but the ecosystems are increas- ingly recognised as important conditions for ensuring the sustainability of development solutions. Water, En- ergy, Food security relies on resources and services pro- vided by healthy ecosystems. Therefore, the Water-En- ergy-Food-Ecosystems Nexus (\u201dWEFE Nexus\u201d) is now the focus of the present Position Paper. In the following sec- tions, the terms \u201cWEFE Nexus\u201d or \u201cNexus\u201d in short refers to this concept unless otherwise stated. The purpose of this Position paper is to outline the im- portance and advantages of the WEFE Nexus as an ap- proach and methodology in EU development coopera- tion aimed at integrating governance and management across water, energy, and food security while attempt- ing to balance different uses of ecosystem resources and services. The document makes special reference to the EU policy framework for development cooperation, particularly the \u201cNew European Consensus on Devel- opment\u201d, to the relevant SDGs, as well as to the main conclusions of the WEFE Nexus specific workshop held in Brussels 25-26 January 2018 and jointly organised by JRC and DEVCO. This workshop was oriented towards implementing and operationalising the Nexus approach with the objective of improving the sustainability of the intervention projects and programmes involving water\u2013 energy\u2013food security based on the experience of the NEXUS experts who attended the workshop. The target audiences for this document are staff from: i) DG DEVCO and other European Commission Directo- rates-General most directly involved in water, energy, food security development cooperation and the envi- ronment; ii) EU Delegations in developing countries and emerging economies in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the EU neighbourhood (MENA) region working in these areas; and, iii) Cooperation Agencies of the EU Member States. This Position Paper introduces the WEFE Nexus and its key advantages. It identifies key policy statements in the New European Consensus on Development that are particularly relevant for a WEFE Nexus approach, and it identifies links between these policy statements and the most relevant SDGs. Following this, it presents the lessons learnt and thoughts from the experts of the five regions and partner organizations that attended the Nexus workshop. Then conclusions and recommenda- tions on how the EU may proceed in implementing the WEFE Nexus approach are presented. Lastly, a short ap- pendix to this document lists selected background doc- uments of relevance to the WEFE Nexus for the target audiences. It must be stressed that this Position Paper: a) should be considered as a practical introduction to this key top- ic; b) is presented in non-technical language; c) for the most part does not make detailed references to the lit- erature in the text; and d) does not address detail of the different EU development cooperation instruments and modalities (National Indicative Programmes, Regional Indicative Programmes, budget support, thematic pro- grammes, etc.) nor how the target audiences may use these instruments and modalities to operationalise the WEFE Nexus approach in their work.

THE WEFE NEXUS IN BRIEF 2.1 The Nexus Defined The WEFE Nexus is an approach that integrates manage- ment and governance across the multiple sectors of food, energy, water, and ecosystems. The Nexus corroborates the need to not view water, energy, food. and ecosystems as being separate entities, but rather as being complex and inextricably entwined. Globally as well as locally, there is a growing realisation of the interconnectedness between Water, Energy, Food Security, and Ecosystems. In simple terms, direct inputs of water are needed in the production of food and energy while energy is required for the storage and distribution of food as well as in water extraction, conveyance, and treatment. Natural resources and ecosystems services also underlie water, food, and energy security. Any limitation in one of the inputs would disturb the availability of one of the others. Applying the WEFE Nexus approach helps to improve understanding of the interdependencies across sectors and the Ecosys- tems with a view to improving integrated solutions in the field that improve achievement of SDGs. Using the Nexus approach means leaving previous sin- gle sector approaches in the past. Since 1992 the water sector has, pursued the IWRM principles and has made good progress, from a distinctly water sector perspec- tive, in coordinating and optimising water use between different users. The Nexus approach does include many of the same basic principles as IWRM and expands them to include food and energy security as well as optimised use of natural resource. The Nexus approach is a way of ensuring more integrated and sustainable use of resources that both reaches beyond the traditional silos and can be applied at all scales.

These drivers often have a strong impact on the resources base, causing environmental degra- dation and resource scarcity, but they also affect and are affected by different social, economic and environmental goals and interests. Figure 2: The FAO approach to the Water-Energy-Food Nexus ",
        "13 THE WEFE NEXUS IN BRIEF This approach need not necessarily be managed by a \u201cNexus ministry\u201d, but rather by a strong and binding coor- dination mechanism (allowing for Nexus Policy Dialogues) where key stakeholders can better identify and prioritise solutions together, benefitting from an overall Nexus per- spective. Under the Nexus paradigm, line ministries are oriented and guided to consider and integrate priorities of other line ministries, which may require compromise by sometimes accepting decisions that may not be optimal from a single sector policy per- spective, but which give the overall trade-off solutions for all sectors involved or at least do no harm other sectors. In these dialogue and negotiation processes, the direct involvement of the scientific-technical di- mension is a supporting element because it provides scientific evidence for evidence-based policy making . 2.2 The Fundamental Principles The Nexus can be seen as a step beyond single sec- tor planning towards a more holistic approach to plan- ning. On an operational level, a complete holistic ap- proach which recognises that everything is influenced by everything else is intricate and difficult to implement. However, choosing to work on Water, Energy, and Food security is a workable scale and includes the associat- ed ecosystem services. Nevertheless, planning for up to 4 components is far more complex than single sector planning. An intermediate operational step would be to plan for up to 2 components without harming or at least minimising the impacts on the other two. Although it will still take years of research and test-implementation be- fore reaching a fully mainstreamed into cross-sectorial planning processes, multi-sectorial dialogues leading to intervention projects successfully addressing concrete multi-sectorial issues and needs are already a reality. The key principles of the WEFE Nexus are now summa- rized as follows: \u2022 Understand the interdependence of resources within a system across space and time and focus on the whole system\u2019s efficiency rather than the productivi- ty of individual components. This will provide integrated solutions that contribute to the sustainability of water, energy, food security policy objectives and to maintaining healthy ecosystems. \u2022 Recognize the interdependence between water, energy, food and ecosystems and promote rational and inclusive dialogue and decision-making processes and efficient use of these resources in an environmentally responsible way. \u2022 Identify integrated policy solutions to optimise trade-offs and maximise synergies across sectors and encourage mutually beneficial responses that en- hance the potential for cooperation between all compo- nents, and public\u2013private partnership at multiple scales. \u2022 Ensure coordination across sectors and stake- holders to enable synergies and increase solution sus- tainability. \u2022 Value the natural capital of land, water, energy sources and ecosystems and encourage governments and business to support the transition to sustainability, e.g., using nature-based solutions. 2.3 The Challenge The planet\u2019s natural resources are increasingly coming un- der pressure and suffering depletion with impacts on eco- systems in many places. Approximately 1.06 billion people, predominantly rural dwellers, still function without electric- ity in 2017. Half of those people live in sub-Saharan Africa; about 793 million people in the world are still undernour- ished in 2016; 2.4 billion have no access to improved san- itation; and ecosystems are affected, for example, about one fifth of the Earth\u2019s land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1998 to 2013. The core threats to the resources are: Population Growth; Economic Development; Urbanisation Development; Lack of Transboundary cooperation; Pollution; and, Climate Change/Variability. The environmental aspect is a reflection of these threats. Population growth projections estimate that the global population will have grown up around to 9 billion by 2050 (7.3 billion in 2015). As a consequence, energy consump- tion is estimated to grow by 80% and food demand by 60% (IEA 2010, FAO 2012). Agriculture is already consum- ing 70% of all global freshwater abstractions (FAO, 2011a: The state of the world\u2019s land and water resources for food and agriculture). While economic development continues to move people from poverty into middle income living, this is resulting in increased demand for water, food, and energy as a conse- quence of consumption patterns. Even if many people are lifted out of poverty, the poorest sector of the population is growing even faster and the actual number of poor people and inequalities are increasing. In an increasingly resource depleted planet, the poorest people will be the most vul- nerable. Increasing demand due to population growth and econom- ic development combined with unsustainable production methods will put increased strain on the natural resources base that is unlikely to be reversed during the foreseeable future.

        "Position Paper on Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 14 In addition, the urbanisation phenomena can also con- strain WEF security and lead to ecosystem degradation as in the case of not well-managed urban development. The growth of urban population is estimated to add \u201d2.5 bil- lion to the world\u2019s urban population by 2050, with almost 90% of this growth happening in Africa and Asia\u201d. Indeed, while regional level harmonization of policies and approaches is good, active coordination of plans across sectors and borders is also needed. Otherwise there are risks from unilateral developments to countries with which resources are shared. Transboundary cooperation on the Nexus solutions can have benefits across sectors and ba- sin commissions/organisations can play an important role. Climate Change brings additional challenges to the Wa- ter, Energy and Food complex because it affects resource availability (quality and quantity) and ecosystems. To- gether with an exacerbated Climate Variability, their effects and impacts need to be integrated in resources planning because they affect short, medium, and long term management practises and production in the wa- ter-energy-food sectors. Having appropriately skilled professionals to address these challenges, ones who understand the principles of Nexus, is required but even this often remains a challenge per se. 2.4 The Key Advantages The WEFE Nexus aims to increase Water, Energy, and Food security without compromising ecosystems ser- vices. In practical terms, the WEFE Nexus helps to im- prove understanding and systematic analysis of the in- teractions between the natural environment and human activities in these three sectors. This will develop more coordinated and sustainable management of natural re- sources across sectors, levels, and scales. Some key benefits arising from utilising the Nexus are: 1. Exploitation of co-benefits to improve overall performance by: Increased resource productivity: Technological inno- vation, recycling of waste, waste reduction, and demand management can all contribute to improving utilisation of available resources. Waste becomes a resource: In particular, waste and residues in Multi-Use systems can become inputs in the other systems. This is a sustainable alternative to a tra- ditional linear economy (take, make, use, dispose) and so the Nexus approach should be considered to be compat- ible and contribute to a circular economic concept which is restorative and generative (i.e. waste water to fertil- iser, solid waste to fuel). Demand management will be a natural outcome of WEFE Nexus analysis which will ensure security. Indeed, demand can be analysed and oriented towards more efficient optimisation of resources/waste through and across uses. Consequently, it also limits the pressure on ecosystems. Two examples are the use of wastewater in agriculture and the use of more adapted energy for pumping water for irrigation and domestic uses. The op- timisation produced by the Nexus will also foster alter- native practises to fulfil multi-sectorial needs or resolve issues. Alternative practise: Wood Fuel can be optimised or replaced by other cooking methods to reduce the related demand for wood and limit impacts on the ecosystem but also on family health while providing families with the energy they need. Introducing sanitation protects wa- ter resources but can also increase the water demand in water-based sanitation. In this case, the Nexus approach can orient the selection of sanitation by considering non water-based sanitation facilities adapted to energy availability. 2. Streamlining development and improving resilience Benefits from productive ecosystems: The Nexus ap- proach also aims to maintain ecosystems which provide multiple services and increase overall benefits. In taking advantage of natural infrastructure and soft path solu- tions, Nexus based solutions complement human-made \u2018hard\u2019 infrastructure and end-of-pipe solutions because ecosystems per se can deliver certain services more effi- ciently (e.g. improved water quality). Poverty alleviation: The Nexus integrative approach is more efficient at improving the basic services of wa- ter supply, modern energy, and food, and also helps to strengthen natural ecosystems and thus maintain a healthy environment. This benefits the poorest popula- tion, who often derive their livelihood directly from the local ecosystem. Climate Change: As Climate Change and Variability Mitigation and Adaptation are included in the dialogues, the Nexus approach makes the necessary planning pro- cesses more transparent and easy for the stakeholder community to understand and accept because of the in- tegrative nature of the dialogues. The Nexus approach contributes to enhancing resilience and to addressing disaster risk (for example, water floods can be stored in the dam and released for agricultural and energy produc- tion purposes later). ",
        "15 THE WEFE NEXUS IN BRIEF 3. Stimulating policy coherence and multipurpose investments Governance, institutions and policy coherence: The Nexus policy dialogues (consultation) embedded in the approach require a high degree of collaboration between sectors and associated institutions. As such, benefits can be achieved on social, economic, and environmental val- ues because sustainable solutions and policy coherence improvements come from well-structured collaborations across the sectors that share objectives and resources. The existing institutional management frameworks such as transboundary or regional agencies are governance infrastructures that can support the Nexus processes and its implementation without additional effort. Such collab- oration frameworks contribute towards minimising uni- lateral developments affecting shared natural resources and the people who depend on them. SDGs support. The NEXUS approach is highly relevant in terms of working towards the SDGs. A single sector approach will not achieve the SDGs. In contrast, the mul- ti-sector approach embedded in the Nexus is a precondi- tion for achieving the SDGs. Stimulate development through multipurpose in- vestment: The Nexus approach can help stimulate in- vestment in sustainable infrastructure and help avoid preventing development by only investing in a single sector. Pricing of ecological services can also help direct investment in more sustainable development projects by combining built and natural infrastructure. 2.5 The Process Managing the WEFE Nexus is a consultative process with key stakeholders contributing and agreeing to responses to the challenges being faced. Relevant stakeholder en- gagement is particularly crucial when implementing the WEFE Nexus because of the need to collaborate across traditional thematic silos. Consultation is a main vehicle for gathering stakeholders together and can: \u2022 bring together stakeholders from different sectors, different spheres of government and countries, and different levels; \u2022 link directly to ongoing and emerging processes; \u2022 develop a shared understanding of issues, objectives, and scenarios; and, \u2022 help develop a shared vision which can be moved towards more specific collaborative activities with the objective of concrete agreements on multi-sectorial and multi-scale strategies to arrive at concrete intervention projects/solutions in view of achieving the SDGs. Key elements of managing the Nexus are: Figure 2: NEXUS Process Inventory of current status Identification of Development Priorities Understand. the WEFE Interactions Analysis UNDERSTANDING THE ENERGY BALANCE UNDERSTANDING THE WATER BALANCE-QUALITY UNDERSTANDING \u2019CLIMATE VARIABILITY\u2018 UNDERSTANDING \u2019FOOD SECURITY\u2018 UNDERSTANDING ECOSYSTEMS Scenario Development Strategic Framework for WEFE Nexus Security Development Investment Plans and Dev.

        "Position Paper on Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 16 Nexus Assessment: The Nexus assessment process will lead to improved understanding of the interactions be- tween the different sectors and their potential impacts on the environment. Nexus assessment outputs shall be a concrete set of optimal solutions (recommendations) coming from the integrated and collaborative models and assessments. These scientifically and technically based outputs will then feed the policy dialogues concerning the predefined priorities and needs. What can be achieved in a Nexus assessment depends on various factors: the con- text, the issues, the actors, and the capacities involved, the constructiveness of the dialogue, the availability of information (data and knowledge ...), and the political will. Evidence: Nexus Assessment initially requires data and knowledge collection to identify the linkages between the water, energy, and food systems, and the impact that changes to these systems can have on the ecosystems and livelihoods which will be at the base of the Nexus as- sessment. Data and knowledge collection includes nat- ural resources, socio-economic information, and policies from relevant sectors. To simplify the complex field of ap- plicability, they need to be adapted to the context, linked to the policy priorities and needs, and to the complexities and sustainability of the environment. The information can be both qualitative and quantitative depending on the case in point. The implementation of this task will consider: a) that there is often a lack of good, accurate, harmonised, and up-to-date knowledge, data, and infor- mation; b) asymmetrical access to information; c) that available data and knowledge in transboundary basins may differ greatly in terms of level of aggregation, scale, accuracy, reliability, etc. not only between countries shar- ing resources but also institutions. Sharing of informa- tion between Institutions involved in data and knowledge collection and management needs to be encouraged as information on critical conditions in one sector impact the other Nexus components. This is particularly important in the case of transboundary waters. Scenario Development: This shall identify short/medi- um/long term effects of possible Nexus intervention or the application of new policies on the natural environ- ment and society at various time and spatial scales. It includes the estimation of potential benefits on the Nex- us components and must highlight impacts on the so- cio-economic goals (SDGs), and lead to a shared vision of water, energy, and food security in a sustainable environ- ment (healthy ecosystems). The scenario can be devel- oped by applying the existing/validated/calibrated tools and models in the various sectors (for instance, life cy- cle assessment, energy or agro-hydrological modelling). These are applied to the different Nexus components by combining them. The outputs of one component/model can become inputs in another one within the framework of an iterative assessment process. Response Options: Consensus will be reached on spe- cific policy options and trade-offs that address planned interventions in an open, participatory, and inclusive dia- logue during stakeholder consultation. The response options need not be built on comprehen- sive quantitative and qualitative data collection but can be built on qualitative analysis immediately after the Ev- idence gathering phase. These four elements need not be addressed in sequence but can be iterative with the objective of integrating new key issues or evidences arising out of the various phases. 16 ",
        "17 THE WEFE NEXUS IN BRIEF 2.6 CASES A few examples are included here to show real situations where the WEFE Nexus can be applied and lead to more sustainable solutions than single sector ones: ELECTRICITY SUBSIDIES FOR FARMERS IN PUNJAB The effect of electricity subsidies for farmers in The Punjab during the last few decades is a well-known documented case study. Access to cheap electricity provided a benefit to farmers in the short term (increasing yields through pumped irrigation), but negatively impacted water quality and availability as well as soil quality due to agriculture intensification. The result is that farmers are struggling to maintain profits from agricultural production while at the same time they are over-exploiting natural resources. THE ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED About 80 percent of the Punjab\u2019s geographical area is cultivated with a cropping intensity of more than 180 percent. Therefore, agriculture in the state is heavily dependent upon its requirement for water. The state\u2019s surface water resources are limited and, owing to an increase in population during the last 50 years, are fully utilized. Therefore, to meet the ever-growing demand for agriculture, industry, and the population, dependency on groundwater has been increasing enormously. Between 1970-71 and 2005-06, the number of tube wells has increased from 0.19 million to more than 1.15 million. As a result of over pumping groundwater coupled with declining average rainfall per year, the water table has declined in most parts of the state. While the state of Punjab is now a leading producer of rice and wheat, this was not always the case. The shift from traditional crops, like cotton or barley, to the monoculture of the rice-wheat system was driven by forces such as price policy, technological change, market infrastructure, and low cost of irrigation. Subsidies in various agricultural inputs such as electricity, fertilizers and agricultural equipment acted as a catalyst for agricultural production. Subsidies have gradually increased in various parts of the state over the years. So it should be acknowledged that the shift from traditional diversified crops to wheat and rice was due to various food security policies and factors like subsi- dies and minimum support price and was not a response to the actual economic returns in the state. The move from traditional crops to primarily rice and wheat in the Punjab has had a negative effect on groundwater level, especially since paddy fields are an extremely water intensive crop growing system. It could be argued that the present grim groundwater condition in the state is essentially the result of faulty production practices leading to irrational excessive use of water. Other factors include restricted availability of surface water, and the heavily subsidized power supply to the agriculture sector resulting in disproportionate installation of tube wells by farmers. WHAT AN INTEGRATED NEXUS ASSESSMENT HIGHLIGHTS The situation in Punjab exemplifies the importance of the inter-linkages between water, energy, and food and the effect one sectorial policy can have on other sectors of the economy. This reinforces the need to take into account all three Nexus dimensions. Due to intensive farming over the last few decades, the yield per hectare of wheat and rice in the Punjab has increased many fold. However, the rising population in India poses a challenge to food security. Dropping water tables could further aggravate the challenge of providing food security as water and energy are intricately interlinked and required to guarantee food security. Consequently, a policy shift in one of the three areas can have a severe impact on the other as exemplified by the effect of energy subsidy on groundwater level in the Punjab. In the long run, energy subsidy will further reduce groundwater levels which in turn will severely impact grain production in Punjab. To ensure faster and more sustainable agricultural development, it is essential to maintain groundwater balance. To this end, the role of subsidies becomes of paramount importance as they can distort the cropping pattern, the variations in inter-regional development, and agricultural inputs like water and energy. In addition, the heavily subsidised agriculture sector means less energy is available to the manufacturing and service sectors and costs more. A clear assessment of the current state of natural resources, like water and soil quality as well as energy required in agriculture and their interrelationships would ",
        "Position Paper on Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 18 be required in making informed policy decisions. As of now, the government of the Punjab is encouraging farmers to install solar powered water pumps by subsidizing their cost. The obvious benefit of this strategy is the reduction in energy used by submersible pumps and also a decrease in fossil fuel use since a large number of water pumps are run by diesel-based generators. However, while this strategy is good from a sustainable energy perspective, it has a minimal or no impact on groundwater extraction since the amount of water being extracted remains the same. Furthermore, most farmers have continued growing wheat and rice since the government guarantees a minimum support price and marketing for these staples. A similar programme for other crops exists.

A) WATER-ENERGY: HYDROPOWER, HYDROCARBONS AND MINING The exploitation of hydrocarbons, which are understood to be fossil fuels and minerals, requires low to very high quantities of water and energy, and can seriously affect the environment and the quality of water resources. This interconnection is highly relevant almost throughout the entire region, but especially in the Andean countries, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and some Central American countries. The impacts become significant when hydraulic fracturing techniques are used. The use of water for energy purposes does not compare with water use for agriculture in quantity (except in arid or semiarid regions), but causes the most social unrest due to the displacement of people, the associated consequences of these displacements, and the impact on the quality of water resources. B) ENERGY-WATER: WATER ABSTRACTION, USE AND DESALINATION The largest energy cost in relation to water in the region occurs to the groundwater abstraction, conveyance, and use, which include irrigation. In fact, the growing dependence on groundwater for irrigation development is shared throughout the region, particularly in Central America, Mexico, and in the desert or semi-desert areas of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. Due to the level of subsidies granted for extraction, aquifer exploitation is also to be evaluated for the Nexus (food production, sustainable water use, and energy efficiency). The increasing overexploitation of aquifers is a key Nexus node that impacts i) WATER - water quality and quantity, ii) FOOD - land availability for production; and, iii) ENERGY - the energy costs of water extraction. Currently, energy consumption is not a significant factor in water treatment or seawater desalination, which remain confined to isolated areas and used for highly profitable activities (mainly in Chile, Mexico, Peru, and some Caribbean countries). C) WATER-FOOD: AGRICULTURE The importance of agriculture in the LAC should be understood in terms of regional specificities, namely large-scale production and its expansion, mainly for export. This type of agriculture has a direct relationship with deforestation, single crop growing, the subsequent increase of risks like diffuse pollution/sedimentation/ erosion and flooding, the displacement of local population, ",
        "19 THE WEFE NEXUS IN BRIEF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEXUS IN THE MEKROU RIVER BASIN During the definition of the Strategic Development Plan in the MEKROU river basin (MEKROU project funded by the EC), the transboundary dialogues naturally gave rise to the Nexus approach (Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger). This hinged on key priorities identified by stakeholders to foster sustainable development. The Nexus assessment methodology included: a) the state of the art of the socio-economic and biophysical issues in the Mekrou river basin; b) identification of the key issues and priorities for development by local-national stakeholders; c) identification of interactions between the different sectors; d) the development of NEXUS analysis tools (E-NEXUS) to simulate stakeholder objectives/ priorities/solutions with local scientific and technical partners; and finally, e) running models and optimisation analysis to test development scenarios and feed the policy maker dialogues. and an impact on household-based or subsistence agriculture, which is vital for sourcing food in the region. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water resources and remains important in terms of share of the gross domestic product, employment forecasts, and so on. D) WATER-ENERGY-FOOD: BIOFUELS, PUMPING, IRRIGATION MODERNIZATION AND URBAN NEXUS A special Nexus link is observed in the case of biofuel production. Indeed, Biofuels consume water for specific crop production (colza, soja\u2026.), are used to produce energy, and can affect food production because of land competition. Agriculture for bioenergy production, especially biofuels, combines both the impacts of large- scale agriculture and the considerable effect on food availability and prices. The development of biofuels is particularly noted in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and, to a lesser extent, Peru, Colombia, and Central American countries such as Costa Rica. Other three-way relationship between Nexus sectors are also relevant in Latin America: i) irrigation modernization requires more energy and greater water consumption but more food production is expected, ii) with the setup of policy for subsidizing electricity (discounted tariffs), aquifer overexploitation is fostered and results in additional water abstraction, therefore potentially impacting crop yields. Finally, the WEF Nexus adopts a particular shape in the urban context which affects this continent very much: very high rates of urban population (80% in 2017), nearly 8 current megalopolises lacking full water supply and sanitation coverage, food and energy supply to be taken to cities. The Nexus approach could be applied and favoured synergies obtained in this concentrated space.

Climate Change and Variability analyses were integrated into the development scenarios because of the strong regional variability of the precipitation and temperature and the climate change impacts on natural resources. The interaction between science and policy, including local institutions, was crucial in this process identifying sustainable development solutions compatible with the availability of the current and future natural resources and the sustainability of the biodiversity (W-Park). The priorities identified were: i) WATER \u2013 water management to satisfy multiple uses; ii) FOOD \u2013 crop and livestock production to generate income and cover food needs; iii) ecosystems preservation (W-Park and Upstream part) to ensure services (energy-water supply, etc.) and tourism. Therefore, Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus became a very relevant approach for the Mekrou river basin to agree on a strategy for sustainable development as well as finding trade-offs between the different uses of resources versus the objectives set at Horizon 2025 by the governments sharing the river basin. The project combined and applied local knowledge from surveys with analytical tools to provide information (e-NEXUS) to decision makers and allow optimal development scenarios for the WEFE Nexus interactions to be developed at river basin scale.

        "21 THE WEFE NEXUS IN BRIEF The Sava Nexus assessment used multi-stakeholder approach involving representatives from the different sector ministries and various interest groups affected by the Nexus from five Sava countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro. The findings of the dialogue workshop highlighted that the need for irrigation will grow as will investments in the energy sector. At the same time, extreme weather events pose risks and might damage infrastructure. Furthermore, investments should be made in new land reclamation strategies. Links between these developments were identified and the related trade-offs discussed in the workshop. The assessment exercise in the Sava Basin is contributing to further integration of water policy with other policies and further dialogue with the key sectorial stakeholders as specific objectives in river basin management defined in the Strategy on Implementation of the Framework Agreement on the Sava River Basin. The process helps to broaden stakeholder involvement in the framework of the International Sava River Basin Commission (ISRBC). The assessment illustrates the value of transboundary cooperation for balancing between increasing energy generation, the ambitious regional climate and energy policy targets, and maintaining a good status of shared waters. A more systematic use of policy instruments, reliable data and information gathering as well as coordination of investments into infrastructure, and promoting multiple and flexible use of infrastructure were among the key recommendations. Furthermore, using ISRBC as a platform to discuss all of the relevant basin resources and for a consultation process to review the impact of national and sectorial development strategies was also recommended.

THE WEFE NEXUS IN THE CONTEXT OF EU DEVELOPMENT POLICY 1 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sectors/infrastructure/water-and-sanitation/water-Nexus_en Recent key EU development policy framework docu- ments include \u201cAn Agenda for Change (2011)\u201d, the \u201cNew European Consensus on Development (2017), the EU External Investment Plan (2016), \u201cA Global Strategy for the European Union\u2019s Foreign And Security Policy\u201d (2016), and various sector development policies. For example, the DEVCO water Nexus policy 1 states that: \u201c \u2026challenges\u2026\u2026can be addressed through ensuring a better management of linked resources. One example is to reconcile the competing needs of water for ener- gy and water for agriculture while securing needs for underpinning ecosystems. This needs to be done in an integrated, transboundary and equitable manner, and enhancing cooperation across borders. Especially in the context of the holistic approach adopted by the post- 2015 agenda, the EU will need to have goals and tar- gets in specific areas while at the same time ensuring that it does not create a \u201cset of silos\u201d of completely separate goals. \u201d A presentation on the EU water devel- opment policy (2012) explicitly mentions the water-en- ergy-food security Nexus under its framework for action. The DEVCO Sustainable Energy Handbook (2016) has a specific Module 2.4 on the Water-Energy-Food Nexus. The above-mentioned New European Consensus on De- velopment \u201cOur World, Our Dignity, Our Future\u201d is a Joint Statement by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. It serves as the overarching EU develop- ment policy framework and from now onwards is re- ferred to as the \u201cConsensus\u201d for short. The Council of Europe Press Release Joint Statement on the adoption of the Consensus states that: \u201c Our new approach to de- velopment is based on the \u2018five Ps\u2019 of the 2030 Agen- da: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnerships. Recognising the interlinkages between the SDGs, we will pay attention to actions that meet multiple goals in a coherent way . We will work across poli- cies and sectors to boost synergies addressing a range of cross-cutting elements to accelerate trans- formation. Based on the principle of policy coherence for development , development objectives will be fully taken into account across EU policies that are likely to affect developing countries. Policy coherence will be ensured to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by partner countries \u201d.

        "25 THE WEFE NEXUS IN THE CONTEXT OF EU DEVELOPMENT POLICY 2 The theme of the overall HLPF was \u201cTransformation towards sustainable and resilient societies\u201d and the specific focus was SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (sustainable energy), SDG 11 (urban development), SDG 12 (sustainable consumption and production patterns), SDG 15 (ecosystems), and SDG 17 (partnerships). 3 The EC DEVCO statement re HLPF: https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/news-and-events/un-high-level-political-forum-eu-and-un-review-progress- towards-achieving-2030_en also noted that the voluntary national reviews (VNRs - a mechanism designed to assess the progress of each UN Member State in achieving the SDGs) would be considered at the HLPF. The 153 available VNRs can be found in the VNR database. The updated 2018 VNR guidelines emphasise examining policy coherence and interlinkages between SDGs, but many VNRs have limited focus on these aspects. 4 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/205432018_HLPF_Presidents_summary_FINAL.pdf 5 http://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholders-launch-sdg-report-outlining-vnr-best-practices-and-recommendations/ 6 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/international-strategies/global-topics/sustainable-development-goals/multi-stakeholder-platform-sdgs_en Paragraph 19 of the Consensus document states: \u201c The implementation of the 2030 Agenda requires compre- hensive national sustainable development strategies that factor in the SDGs and their interlinkages . When planning and implementing development coop- eration, the EU and its Member States will pay par- ticular attention to such interlinkages and to inte- grated actions that can create co-benefits and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way \u201d. This and many other key policy statements in the Consensus directly or indirectly provide the EU policy context for a WEFE Nexus approach in EU development cooperation. It is also noted that the July 2018 UN High Level Pol- icy Forum (HLPF 2 ) focussed on the themes in SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, and 17 which was highly relevant from a WEFE Nexus perspective. Related to its participation and contributions to the HLPF, the European Commis- sion stated 3 that \u201cInvestment in these SDGs will yield significant co-benefits for the whole 2030 Agenda, which will only be achieved through an integrated, ho- listic approach\u201d. The Ministerial Declaration from the HLPF stated that: \u201cWhile our 2018 review emphasizes Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, and 17, the integrated, indivisible, and universal nature of the Goals makes it essential that we pay particu- lar attention to leveraging synergies and co-benefits across all dimensions of sustainable development\u201d. The HLPF President\u2019s summary 4 contains a reference to the \u201cland-food-water-energy-climate Nexus\u201d and mentions that many HLPF speakers expressed their increased understanding of how progress could be leveraged through addressing the many interlinkages between the SDGs. In connection with the HLPF, the European Commission stated 5 that it, together with its member States, will prepare a Joint Synthesis Report on the implementation of the European Consensus on Development for the 2019 session of the HLPF, and that it has established a high level multi-stakeholder platform 6 on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Support for strengthening of the aforementioned national voluntary reviews (NVRs) of SDG implementation could be a priority. 85 \u201cThe EU and its Member States will support capacity building for nationally owned monitoring frameworks, quality data collection, disaggregation and analysis, including through digital monitoring tools and for policy coherence for sustainable development \u201d. Use opportunities for more concerted multilateral action on advancing a Nexus approach because the EU is strengthening its partnerships with other multilateral organisations . The above-mentioned UN HLPF annual events may offer good opportunities for demonstrating the advantages of a Nexus approach in the implementation of the SDGs, and the HLPFs are good opportunities to assess the NVRs in a multilateral setting with national high-level delegations and multilateral development partners. The European Development Days (EDDs) and similar events attended by the wider international development community may also provide opportunities to advance concerted Nexus action. 90 \u201cThe EU and its Member States will strengthen their partnerships with multilateral organisations , including the United Nations system, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, regional development banks, the G7, the G20, the OECD and other regional and mul- tilateral institutions. They will encourage them to align their strategic planning and operational activities with the 2030 Agenda and foster mutual and coordinated support in implementation thereof, in full alignment with national sustainable development strategies\u201d. Take opportunities to demonstrate innovation and examples of the advantages that a Nexus approach can offer as the EU places emphasis on fostering innovative engagement with more advanced developing countries . Facilitating the exchange of the lessons, best practices from emerging economies, and using the \u201cpower of the example\u201d could have strong influence on weaker developing economies and fragile countries, and there may be opportunities for \u201cleapfrogging\u201d to apply solutions that benefit from Nexus approaches. This could also involve new partnerships with centres of excellence that have demonstrated successful Nexus solutions. Box after para. 95 \u201cThe EU and its Member States will develop new part- nerships with more advanced developing countries in order to promote the implementation of the 2030 Agenda through a broader range of cooperation\u2026. These new partnerships will promote the exchange of best practices , technical assistance, and knowledge sharing\u2026 will work with these countries to promote South-South and triangular cooperation \u201d. Work with partner countries to enhance the enabling environ- ment for a Nexus approach as the EU will work with partner countries to promote sound policy environments for implementing the 2030 Agenda . It is widely recognised and well-documented that the SDGs are interconnected and that working closely with all relevant stakeholders is beneficial. This includes the private sector, which is key to achieving the SDGs. This will also include a \u201cwhole of government approach\u201d working across traditional development sectors to strengthen the enabling environment for more concerted action. 99 \u201c\u2026 will promote policies linking public and private pro-development action and an enabling environment for inclusive sustainable growth and its equitable distribution through national budgets. They will plan their development cooperation around strengthening countries\u2019 own capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda\u201d. Support a Nexus/cross-sectorial approach in pursuing policy coherence for development (PCD), which is key to achieving the SDGs. The PCD is a key element of EU Consensus policy and there are many opportunities for Nexus thinking in the dynamic policy environment for development cooperation and in strategic policy dialogue with partner countries. This is the case, for example, in budget support and programmes related to thematic areas such as climate change that cut across traditional sector policy areas. 109 \u201cThe EU and its Member States reaffirm their commit- ment to Policy Coherence for Development \u2026 The 2030 Agenda provides new impetus for the EU and its Member States to formulate and implement mutually reinforcing policies\u201d.

And para#112: \u201cThe EU and its Member States will moreover strengthen their dialogue with partner countries on policy coherence and support partner countries in their own efforts to put in place enabling frameworks for policy coherence for sustainable development\u201d.

Ongoing EU action towards sustainable global supply chains , such as in the timber and garment sectors, illustrate the added value of pursuing a coherent approach \u201d. Facilitate a Nexus approach by aligning the theory of change of EU development cooperation and its results frameworks with SDG indicators. It is EU policy that the EU\u2019s reporting systems will be made consistent with the 2030 Agenda indicators, and as described in the foregoing, coordinated, cross-sectorial approaches are inherent in the SDGs. Conse- quently, this can be an effective means of supporting a Nexus approach. 119 \u201cThe EU and its Member States will integrate the 2030 Agenda and support the use of SDG indicators to measure development results at country level.\u201d Make use of the planned joint synthesis reports on the Consensus to assess how the Consensus policy has facilitated a WEFE Nexus approach and where further actions is needed. As mentioned above the EU is planning to submit a joint syn- thesis report to the 2019 HLPF and this offers a very good op- portunity to demonstrate where the Consensus has facilitated Nexus approaches and where further action is needed. 120 \u201cThe EU and its Member States will produce a joint synthesis report on the Consensus on Development, including the impact of their actions in support of the 2030 Agenda in developing countries, as a contribution to EU reporting to the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) when meeting at Head-of-State level every four years\u201d. Similarly, the EU should make use of the 2024 mid-term assessment of the Consensus to address progress on policy coherence and Nexus approaches. A plan of action could be developed to elicit examples and lessons learned over the coming years on how Consensus areas of policy emphasis and its (limited) emphasis on modalities has facilitated success stories on development outcomes and impact facilitated by a WEFE Nexus approach. 123 \u201cA mid-term assessment of the implementation of this Consensus will be carried out by 2024.\u201d 37 ",

FEEDBACK FROM THE NEXUS REGIONAL DIALOGUES 9 https://www.nexus-dialogue-programme.eu and https://www.water-energy-food.org In the frame of the NEXUS Regional Dialogues Pro- gramme 9 , NEXUS experts (see Appendix 2) from the geo- graphical regions \u2013 Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Central Asia and Af- rica (Southern Africa and the Niger Basin in Western Africa) \u2013were consulted on the regional priorities during a work- shop held in Brussels in early 2018. Experts at this meet- ing provided lessons learnt from experiences regarding the implementation of the Nexus approach in their respec- tive geographical areas. The consultation was organised around a series of topics and debates on: 1) Applying Sus- tainable Technological Approaches and Solutions; 2) Data, Nexus tools and models; 3) Governance, Finance, Institu- tions, and Cooperation Frameworks. Furthermore, each of these topics was structured around a series of sub-themes previously agreed to feed the discussions. 6.1 Applying Sustainable Technological Approaches and Solutions The sub-themes proposed were: \u2022 The role of off-grid solutions e.g., for water pumping or desalination in breaking the fossil-fuel economic de- pendency, including as applied to food security; \u2022 From waste to resources: opportunities to turn waste- water and agricultural waste into nutrients and energy, and associated risks; \u2022 The levels at which to apply a Nexus approach to competency and capacity building to promote \u201cNexus thinking\u201d and take action across sectors, countries, and ar- eas of responsibility; Several recommendations in this topic mainly revolve around technological innovations in the energy sector. Case knowledge indicates that the choice of hybrid tech- nologies, for instance combining several sources (of en- ergy and/or water), can fit local conditions and improve sustainability of energy/water sources for agricultural/ir- rigation purpose. Off-grid solutions to satisfy energy and water needs were also found to be cost effective at local scale (e.g. farm scale) even though there are still tech- nological challenges with providing a steady supply and also storage for intermittent use of off-grid solutions. Fur- thermore, renewable energy-based off-grid solutions have a role in supplementing fossil fuel reliance rather than representing a generic alternative to them. They have the potential to reduce the amount of water used as well as increase food security and water availability in remote ar- eas. The optimisation of national/regional grids and plants facilitates the deployment of additional energy capacities. This is supported by significantly efficient institutional and financial frameworks. For example, existing hydraulic in- frastructure provides opportunity for additional low-carbon energy generation with minimal or no extra social and en- vironmental costs. Turning solid waste (from e.g. agriculture activities) into a resource appears to present fewer risks than wastewater. In particular, char made from crop residues or other wet agricultural waste like manure can substitute wood char- coal as energy carrier for cooking in rural areas and other local-level applications for food production (such as soil improving material), energy production (in combination with anaerobic digestion), or water production (as cleaned by filtering). Particularly at community level, implementing such solution implies capacity building and promotion of the Nexus solution. In this case, it needs to be practical and social acceptance constraints working against it need to be overcome. A key conclusion for all sectors is the need for further de- velopment of inter-sectorial knowledge, understanding and collaboration. Training in applying the Nexus approach must specifically address the intervention level and its challenges (transboundary, national, regional, and local), and associat- ed with capacity building actions especially in less devel- oped regions/organised sectors. Professionals in each sector need to know more about and understand the thinking and methods applied in the other sectors. Moreover, collabora- tion between sectors needs to be very operational oriented. ",
        "41 FEEDBACK FROM THE NEXUS REGIONAL DIALOGUES 6.2 Data, Nexus tools and models The sub-themes proposed were: \u2022 The challenges to integrate or link quantitative models focusing on multiple Nexus pillars and dimensions i.e. Water, Energy, Land, Climate Change, the Environment, and others; \u2022 The trade-off between the level of sophistication of Nexus Decision Support Tools and the level of integration across scales for effective modelling and meaningful deci- sion-making; \u2022 The opportunities and risks of an open source approach to Nexus tools and data sharing as opposed to commercial packages and solutions; \u2022 The importance of establishing a Nexus Cooperation Framework at multi-sectorial, country, or transboundary levels from assessment to resource- or benefit-sharing agreements. In general, NEXUS experts found that the data available is generally insufficient for appropriate Nexus assessment. Consequently, there is a general need to improve data col- lection across the different sectors and scales. In the particu- lar case of biophysical data where ground data is particular- ly lacking, remote sensing has been highlighted as a means of bridging and supplementing this gap, at least in certain thematic areas. Field surveys can also be used as ways of collecting local and traditional knowledge that would com- plement biophysical and socio-economic data and a way to concretise what the real issues are. This is key to supporting decision making in terms of food security, poverty reduction, sustainable basin management, and inclusive development. Open-source models and open-access platforms combining spatial data have been well received in low- and middle-in- come countries where license costs and governmental au- thorisation may be difficult to overcome or obtain. However, insufficient data and models available should not be seen as a stumbling block or a reason for not using the Nexus approach until data and models are ideal. 41 ",
        "Position Paper on Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 42 The integration of different models and methods can tackle the inherent complexity of the Nexus and address its multi- disciplinary construction. However, fully holistic models are not necessarily required. A soft-coupling of models is pref- erable at the more practical level: the output of one sector model becomes an input to another sector model, and realis- tic solutions can be prepared and generated with a few itera- tions. It is also advisable not to focus entirely on the technical side of the resource reallocation problem. Because they are able to engage more thematic components than quantitative methods, qualitative modelling approaches can help map the WEFE system and locate priorities and trade-offs to be discussed and negotiated afterwards. The most important is that the users of data and models are sufficiently trained and experienced to be able to make an evaluation of results to proceed with a NEXUS assessment. They must also be able to understand that the resulting decisions are not only based on quantitative information, but also on qualitative judge- ments. The latter is acceptable provided that it happens in an open and transparent process, that is, during the dialogue component included in the Nexus approach. In fact, even though not a pre-requisite to it, quantitative modelling can be a means of stimulating dialogue. NEXUS assessments should start with the identification of specific issues where allocation of resources is at odds with their interconnected nature i.e. a Nexus hotspot. The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been used for strategic country Nexus assessments for some years in many coun- tries such as in Europe and South Africa and could support the practical implementation of the Nexus assessment. The need for a Nexus approach often stems directly from local stakeholders raising interlinked priorities for the water, agricul- ture, food, energy, and environmental sectors during in-place national or transboundary dialogues.

        "43 FEEDBACK FROM THE NEXUS REGIONAL DIALOGUES proach would still require creating collaborations between the multiple disciplines, institutions, and organizations involved in the different sectors. There is a priori more value from over- arching frameworks such as regional economic commissions, river basin organizations, or inter-ministerial committees in a transboundary setting compared to the national context. 6.3 Governance, Finance, Institutions and Cooperation Frameworks The sub-themes proposed were: \u2022 The requirements for investment-ready Nexus projects with potentially conflicting objectives i.e., financial and eco- nomic vs. social and environmental in a portfolio approach to finance; \u2022 The river basin scale as the most appropriate management framework for approaching and implementing the Nexus; \u2022 The advantages of promoting a Nexus approach within the ongoing debates and actions surrounding Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation; \u2022 The operational aspects of the Nexus as a platform to guide sustainability efforts underpinned by the SDGs; \u2022 The definition, utility, and use of a Nexus Project Toolkit for Inclusive Green Growth and Sustainable Development. Many recommendations talk about finding financing for Nex- us infrastructure and the consensus is that new innovative fi- nancing mechanisms are needed. In fact, when analysing and looking at investment decisions, attention is usually focused on two parameters: return on investment or simply profita- bility (i.e. measured investment efficiency) and risk (including in terms of impact on society and the environment). Risk is seen as particular important because Nexus projects include social elements that are not commercially viable. This is why projects need to be designed with the more easily bankable components associated with the less bankable components from the onset. As such, the whole programme can become viable and bankable if implemented under a blended finance approach. Public-Private Partnerships and Climate funds are mentioned as opportunities as well as investments oriented towards sustainable, socially responsible, ethical, green ac- tivities such as Green bonds. The most appropriate financing model will be determined on a case by case basis, and there is still a need to test various models. 10 Source http://www2.giz.de/wbf/4tDx9kw63gma/UrbanNEXUS_Publication_ICLEI-GIZ_2014_kl.pdf 11 https://www.sim4nexus.eu/ simulates policies based on the resource constraints of an area; http://www.wefnexustool.org quantifies the interrela- tions and trade-offs between the water, energy, and transportation sectors under different scenarios. From a governance point of view, the Nexus approach does not really need new institutional structures or major re-struc- turing. What is needed is comprehensive collaboration be- tween entities such as working networks or platforms sup- ported by multi sector policies, protocols, and procedures. Climate and Environmental actions and the Nexus approach can work hand in hand; the success in one is closely linked to success in the other. The NEXUS approach as Climate Change and Environment actions requires multi-sectorial thinking and the raising of awareness. For example, the urgency to deal with the effect of Climate Change offers an opportunity to push the Nexus approach to the forefront. This facilitates the development of National Adaptation Plans in an overall Nex- us approach process. The National cooperation frameworks developed under climate change or on IWRM, if they exist in a country, can be easily reused within the NEXUS approach and governance structures could be appropriated to define and implement Nexus solutions. Transboundary cooperation framework or river basin institutions could also embed the Nexus dialogue and cooperation between WEFE stakeholders. This highlights the need for connecting multiple sectors, anal- ysis, and management at different scales. The national scale may be appropriated for target-setting as being the scale for the SDGs whilst municipality or watershed scales may drive most of the changes. Cities can be also considered as an appropriate scale because this is where local and global resource constraints meet 10 . Resource challenges are further exacerbated by the fast-expanding growth rates and ineffi- cient infrastructure systems of developing cities in several regions of the world. It follows that the urban environment is an emerging context for applying a Nexus approach. Considering the novelty of this approach, it appears that the definition, utility, and use of a Nexus Project Toolkit for In- clusive Green Growth and Sustainable Development could include quantitative analyses of the benefits of the approach in the individual sectors, implementation guidelines, and good experiences. Some good fit-for-purpose methodologies already exist (e.g. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) or as developed by research projects 11 ) that can be adopted and/or adapted. NEXUS approach could learn from the SEA processes. The upscaling of a pilot Nexus project to larger scale pro- grammes should be part of the Toolkit. This should also cover processes to identify up-scalable project elements, steps to be followed when institutionalising the Nexus processes and dialogues, and finally pre-conditions to upscaling in terms of identifying financial and human resources.

The Nexus can also be a strong support for reaching the SDGs. As for any innovation that needs to be up-scaled, it is important to consider a few questions in this context: \u2022 Identifying the good examples that have the potential for upscaling. While there are many examples of nexus ap- proaches in the literature, there is a need for a structured ap- proach to further identification and documentation of nexus examples/case studies. \u2022 Scalable: Are all elements of a given Nexus programme scalable? Programmes are always implemented in a specific economic, social, and physical context that will influence the implementation and may be different in the next programme. A Lessons Learned report can be used to identify the suc- cessful NEXUS elements that can be up-scaled. \u2022 Vertical upscaling: This deals with the institutionalisation of the Nexus approach at different levels. This involves polit- ical will and capacity building at the relevant levels and es- tablishing or uses semi-permanent collaborative/governance structures for relevant stakeholders. This requires that the relevant stakeholders are willing to participate in upscaling, and that there are some real Nexus programmes that such collaborative forums can implement. NEXUS experts empha- sised the value of building NEXUS dialogues around existing governance frameworks rather than creating any specific NEXUS forums. \u2022 Horizontal upscaling: This is about replication of the Nex- us programme in another geographic or thematic context. In recent years Nexus pilot programs may have been imple- mented using external resources, both financial and human, but for an actual upscaling to take place, a greater degree of own funding and own human resources are needed. Peer-to- peer exchanges of successful examples and lessons learned are certainly helpful in horizontal upscaling. \u2022 Timing: If upscaling is expected to be based on an ongoing or planned Nexus programme and impact on the 2030 Agen- da for Sustainable Development, it would be very useful to plan for this as early as possible and align it to the relevant planning processes. Planning cycles in government structures at all levels and in the private sector need to be followed, and such cycles can easily be up to 18 months. Having upscaling in mind right from the start of a Nexus programme will also facilitate the monitoring and assessment of up-scalable pro- gramme elements. 47 ",

CONCLUSIONS The EU and the international community are realising that Water, Energy, Food, and Ecosystems components are interlinked and require joint planning in order to meet the daunting global challenges of Water, Energy, and Food security while maintaining ecosystem health and consequently reach the SDGs. If not dealt with, the world will have difficulties to meet the demand for wa- ter, energy, and food in the not too distant future, and in any case, in a sustainable way. The strain on ecosystems resulting from unsustainable single-sector planning will lead to increasing poverty, inequality, and instability. The Nexus approach is fully aligned with and supportive of the EU Consensus on Development. Key elements of the Consensus will require collaborative efforts across sectors in ways that can be supported/implemented by a Nexus approach. As a result, transparent and accounta- ble decision-making involving the civil society is key and common to the European Consensus on Development and the Nexus approach. The Nexus approach will support the implementation of the SDGs especially SDG 2 (Food), SDG 6 (Water), and SDG 7 (Energy), but most SDGs have elements linked to food, water, and energy in one or more ways, and will benefit from a Nexus approach. The SDGs are designed to be cross-cutting and to be implemented together, which is also reflected in a WEFE Nexus approach. This approach offers a sustainable way of addressing the effects of Climate Change and increase resilience. The WEFE Nexus includes the main drivers of climate change (water, energy, and food security) and the main sectors affected (water and the environment). Decisions around policy, infrastructure, etc. developed on the ba- sis of WEFE Nexus assessments will be suitable as el- ements of climate change mitigation and adaptation. In fact, it is difficult to imagine solutions to the climate change issue that are not built on a form of Nexus ap- proach. As examples in the literature demonstrate, this approach is already being implemented around the world. These examples together with more examples from the EU and member state development cooperation will help build experience that can be consolidated and become an im- portant contribution to a Toolkit for WEFE Nexus Imple- mentation. It appears from the expert discussions that because of the novelty of the approach, a Toolkit will be an important element in getting the Nexus approach accepted and widely used. This should build on expe- rience from practical examples of NEXUS projects or similar inter-sectorial collaboration projects, and there is already policy, regulation, and practical experience for institutions and countries to start applying this concept. A fully developed WEFE Nexus approach is a compre- hensive and far reaching methodology that requires awareness capacity and tools. The Nexus results can be achieved by taking a step by step approach. Some key recommendations arising out of NEXUS expert consul- tation include: \u2022 Effective collaboration is at the core of WEFE Nexus implementation. The achievement of effective collab- oration to deal with the Nexus is deemed to be more important than the establishment of an ad-hoc Nexus body. Collaboration can be triggered by key issues such as climate change, which have led to the formation of soft-type bodies such as national committees. There is also more value to be gained from overarching frame- Position Paper on Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ",
        "51 CONCLUSIONS works such as regional economic commissions, river basin organizations, or inter-ministerial committees in a trans- boundary setting compared to the national context. \u2022 The socially oriented components of a Nexus pro- gramme have limited commercial potential. However, the whole programme can become a viable Public-Pri- vate Partnership if implemented under a blended finance approach including investment finance from commercial funders and private investors, development capital from Development Finance Institutions, and grants from do- nors. The Nexus can increase a project\u2019s overall financial ability to cater for the less commercially viable compo- nents. This is why projects need to be designed with the more easily bankable components associated with the less bankable components from the onset. The co-ben- efit analysis and cost optimisation due to the Nexus approach is how projects are made Nexus projects and how Nexus projects are made fundable. \u2022 The Nexus approach can be applied at different scales. Each scale accounts for a unique assortment of ele- ments, processes, and actors, and all scales intersect. The national scale may be appropriate for target-set- ting while municipality or watershed scale may drive the most changes in the population living conditions. The landscape scale is important for uniting different needs including those of ecosystems while food security is affected by global issues such as export prices and global energy demand. \u2022 The NEXUS approach does not give precedence to Wa- ter over other sectors, but explicitly addresses trade- offs and synergies between sectors and strongly pro- motes sustainability and security. Therefore, to address food security in a region would mean addressing water resources, their development and management, and also energy generation. Responding to pressures on wa- ter resources would then shift to responding to broader basin stress and socio-economic pressures such as ag- riculture and energy production linked to the develop- ment of populations. Combining natural and built infra- structure, i.e. nature-based solutions, is key to achieving the SDGs. \u2022 Assessment and Modelling is an important aspect of the Nexus approach. Developing a fully integrated cross-sector model addressing all of the different po- tential NEXUS issues is a complex process. Therefore, it should go through processes where outputs from var- ious existing models become inputs into other models through a \u201cloose coupling\u201d and for the purpose of ad- dressing very concrete issues-priorities-needs. \u2022 Some good fit-for-purpose methodologies already exist to assess impacts across sectors. Strategic En- vironmental Assessments (SEAs) seem to be one of the most suitable frameworks where Nexus can be addressed. The SEA identifies and prevents of possi- ble environmental impacts in decision-making right from the start. Similarly, the Nexus process identifies inter-sectorial benefits and challenges including social and ecological ones. \u2022 It is very important for a hypothetical NEXUS toolkit to provide relevant guidance for policy dialogue at a strategic level to ensure that decision-makers are made aware of the benefits of a nexus approach and can fa- cilitate the required cross-sectorial coordination at the relevant levels of governance and strengthen the en- abling framework for engaging the private sector and civil society.
