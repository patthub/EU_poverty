        "EESC info \u2014 April 2008 1 EESC plenary session Michel Barnier proposes the establishment of a European civil protection force Mr Michel Barnier attended the EESC March plenary session at the invitation of EESC President Dimitriadis. Mr Barnier, former European Commissioner and one- time special adviser to the Euro- pean Commission president (and currently French Minister for Ag- riculture and Fisheries), called for the creation of a European emer- gency intervention force, stressing the key role that organised civil society had to play in developing supranational solidarity. President Dimitriadis applauded Mr Barnier\u2019s role as a main archi- tect of a European civil protection force. Following last year\u2019s fires in the Peloponnese region of Greece and recent natural disasters in other regions of Europe, the EESC had almost unanimously adopted a resolution on the response to natural disasters and their preven- tion at its plenary session in Sep- tember 2007. On 5 March 2008, the European Commission un- veiled an action plan to improve civil protection. The plan takes up many of the recommendations in As part of the celebrations to be held on 28 May 2008 marking the 50th anniversary of the EESC\u2019s first plenary session, young Europeans will open a debate on the chal- lenges facing the European Union and the European Economic and Social Committee. Represented by 10 trainees from the Committee and mem- bers of the European Youth Forum (EYF), an organisation bringing together around 100 European as- sociations, these young Europeans have for some weeks been draw- ing up a \u2018profession of faith\u2019 which will serve as a springboard for discussion with EESC members The voice of young Europeans on the 50th anniversary of the EESC >>> page 2 President Dimitriadis and Minister Barnier during the EESC plenary session EDITORIAL www.eesc.europa.eu Dear readers, The conference on \u2018Advantages and benefits of the euro: time for assessment\u2019 was organised by the ECO Section on 14 and 15 April 2008, with the particip- ation of the main EU institutions and civil society organisations. After eight years of the euro, in the hands of more than 300 million Europeans, some clear conclusions can be drawn. Given that the euro is generally deemed to have been an unqualified success, we need to understand why it is still criticised by some sections of the public, search for the reasons and, where possible, propose solutions. The euro is the main contributor to the European identity: indeed, it has become the symbol of that identity, of shared values and successful integration, and fosters a feeling of belonging to a \u2018strong\u2019 entity within the EU. The euro has contributed to transparency and has facilitated comparison of prices of goods and services, salaries and social security contributions. This comparison has enabled people to make the most appropriate purchase choices, strengthening competition and, as a general rule, helping to keep prices in the euro area down. In many countries, price increases coincided exactly with the introduction of the euro. Hence the public feeling that the price increases were generated by the euro, a feeling which still remains and is becoming more ingrained. A point on which everyone agrees is that the euro has eliminated exchange risks and currency transaction costs in trade within the euro area, and, to some extent, with other countries both within and outside Europe. The fact that there are no longer risks of fluctuation has thus made trade relations more stable for businesses in the euro area. One of the benefits most immediately obvious to the public is that travelling is easier: the euro removes exchange costs, facilitates payments and simplifies changes of location. The single currency protects Europe (or rather the countries of the euro area) from external shocks such as rises in oil prices or turbulent exchange markets. The euro helps to moderate inflation and exchange rates, encouraging businesses to invest. There is no doubt about the euro\u2019s international role. The single currency quickly became an international currency which was an established part of the capital market and, to some extent, a reserve currency. A strong currency has benefits for some and disadvantages for others, but the important thing is the assessment of its net benefit to the economy: an undoubted advantage of the euro. A final conclusion of the conference is that the euro requires more and better coordination of economic policies, additional integration in finance, further tax harmonisation and an enhanced internal market.

Mr Barnier underlined the im- portance of setting up a European rapid reaction force capable of re- sponding to the risks posed by nat- ural disasters by enabling the EU Member States to join forces \u2014 in particular, he insisted on the need to create structures and procedures allowing the EU to better antici- pate disasters. He also stressed the vital role of the EESC which has been campaigning vigorously for Europe to take concrete action to protect its citizens. Following Mr Barnier\u2019s speech, several EESC members took the floor.

        "2 EESC info \u2014 April 2008 The REX work programme 2008 is very ambitious. What is the \u2018key\u2019 focus of the work programme? Our task and intention are to support the EU in its foreign, trade, enlargement and develop- ment policies. Our ambition is to contribute as a credible flanking partner to the EU\u2019s efforts to im- prove its relations with third coun- tries and regions. Our contribution is put in practice by tabling opin- ions with civil society\u2019s views and recommendations, by establishing networks with civil society actors, as well as by supporting capacity building and the improvement of civil dialogue in third countries and regions. and Social Committee make?\u2019, will be presented by the young Euro- peans during the commemorative session, and later at a press con- ference. It will cover issues such as the European social model, shared values, the Lisbon strategy, education, and the efforts that the European institutions must make to communicate with civil soci- ety, and will be the result of close cooperation between the EESC\u2019s groups and sections, trainees and young people\u2019s organisations from European civil society. (cid:76) MEMBERS\u2019 NEWS Continued from page 1 Interview Six questions on the REX work programme 2008 to Mr Hamro-Drotz Tabling opinions is a core task of the Committee, but our role to arrange events to stimulate at grass-root level understanding and interaction must not be un- derestimated. Look for instance at the important outcome of the two conferences we arranged in March: the EU\u2013Africa conference and the EU\u2013ACP conference. In April, we will with the same pur- pose arrange the EU\u2013Latin Amer- ica conference. Due to the fact that the Lisbon Treaty brings, in forth- coming years, the common foreign and security policy, we will, in 2008, also consider how the EESC should meet this new policy in its external activities. Of the 14 opinions that will be drawn up in 2008, which one do you see as the most important? The opinions to be prepared have been critically selected from a number of proposals. This means that the opinions to be tabled this year are all prioritised. Above all, the REX Section prepares own- initiated opinions, which is differ- ent from the other sections. The number of opinions requested by the Commission is increasing. Based on our contacts with civil society actors in third countries and regions, the REX opinions also take into account these actors\u2019 views. This adds an extra credibil- ity to our opinions and messages to the EU. The opinions are gener- ally highly recognised too in third countries and regions. In the work programme, you highlight around 10 topics and areas such as Turkey and Croatia, the EEA, the western Balkans and so on. Which are for you the most sensitive ones? The EESC\u2019s external activities mirror the priorities in the EU\u2019s foreign, trade, enlargement and development policies. Presump- tive candidate countries and the countries and regions bordering the European Union are for us naturally priorities. But also coun- tries and regions elsewhere in the world, with which the EU has an international agreement that in- cludes provisions regarding the EESC role. Countries where the ACP\u2013EU: a better partnership for better development economy fails and civil society does not function properly are the most sensitive and challenging objects for our activity. As regards the countries which are, or might become, candidate countries, we must recognise that preparedness for fulfilling membership condi- tions matures quite slowly, both at governmental and civil society levels. The EESC has a central role to play during this process. We have 11 standing delegations working in different directions outside the EU borders. These delegations are the main actors to put into practice our work in third countries and regions. The delega- tions shall address during the year sensitive topics in their field of re- sponsibility, some of which are at the top of the EU agenda, such as climate change, energy resources or migration. In this way we bring real added value to the efforts to strengthen external relations and understanding. The REX Section is responsible for coordinating this work. (to be continued in our next issue) (cid:76) From 4 to 6 March 2008, the Eu- ropean Economic and Social Committee (EESC) held the 25th meeting of ACP\u2013EU economic and social interest groups entitled \u2018A better partnership for better de- velopment\u2019. This meeting, prepared under the aegis of the ACP\u2013EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, provided civil society representa- tives with an opportunity to dis- cuss the ACP\u2013EU partnership in the presence of: Mr Dimitriadis, EESC President; Mr Michel, Eu- ropean Commissioner responsible for development and humanitar- ian aid; Mrs Kinnock, co-President of the ACP\u2013EU Joint Parliamenta- ry Assembly; and Mr Falkenberg, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate-General for Trade. HE Mr Ali Farah Assoweh, President EESC President Dimitriadis and European Commissioner Michel of the ACP Council of Ministers and a representative of the African Union\u2019s Ecosocc, also attended. The aims of this meeting were to evaluate the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, fol- low up the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements (EPAs), and look at ways to boost the participation of ACP coun- tries\u2019 economic and social interest groups in the EPAs. Other subjects were also discussed, including the EU\u2013Africa strategy, the consulta- tive function and social dialogue at national and regional level, and the issue of \u2018human resources for development\u2019. Two reports drawn up by the ACP\u2013EU follow-up committee were used as a basis for discussion. Mrs Heinisch meets Chancellor Merkel C o p y r i g h t B : A G S O Chancellor Merkel and the BAGSO delegation On 4 March 2008, Mrs Eva Belabed (Group II, Employees, Austria) left the EESC in order to join the Austrian delegation at the OECD in Paris. EESC member since 1992, Ms Belabed took a very active part in the work of the Committee: she was a member of the Single Market, Production and Consumption (INT) Section, being elected as Vice-President of the Single Market Observatory since 2002, and of the External Relations Section (REX), where she was elected member of the Section Bureau from 2004. She was also a very active and appreciated member of the EESC Communication Group. On 11 March 2008, German Chancellor Angela Merkel held talks with the Executive Com- mittee of the Federal Association of German Senior Citizens\u2019 Or- ganisations (BAGSO). The EESC member representing BAGSO, Mrs Renate Heinisch (Group III, Various Interests, Germany), par- ticipated in the talks. \u2018We need the commitment of older people in order to cope with the consequences of demographic change\u2019, the Chancellor declared. There was consensus on the need to examine age limits in certain professional and non-working areas. BAGSO proposed setting up an expert commission involving representatives from politics, science, the social partners and senior citizens\u2019 associations. Renate Heinisch, BAGSO Exec- utive Committee member, will continue to be actively involved within our Committee with issues and solutions relating to demographic change. Spring 2008 EESC trainees involved in the debate Representatives from ACP\u2013EU economic and social interest groups adopted a final declara- tion calling for negotiations on the EPAs to continue at a pace ap- propriate to the capacities of ACP countries. The delegates also called for the interim trade agreements to be used as stepping stones to- wards comprehensive EPAs, with a view to pursuing progress to- wards regional integration. The participants stressed that EPAs should be instruments for devel- opment and poverty alleviation. This meeting brought together delegates from the 78 ACP coun- tries, European civil society organ- isations\u2019 representatives, ACP and European economic and social council representatives, as well as representatives from the European institutions and international or- ganisations.

        "EESC info \u2014 April 2008 3 and Slovenian presidencies, the Committee called for conditions conducive to compliance with Eu- ropean directives, in accordance with international and humanitar- ian law. To this end, the Committee recommended measures that are inseparable from and comple- mentary with each other, aiming to ensure better distribution of the responsibilities incumbent on Member States; the speedy reset- tlement and integration of people granted refugee status or subsidi- ary protection; a sincere coopera- tion and co-development policy that improves effective democracy in certain third countries and that contributes to international solidarity in response to asylum needs. The EESC on a future common European asylum policy by An LeNouail Marli\u00e8re European Consumer Day 2008: \u2018Consumer redress\u2019 The Committee suggests ex- cluding or avoiding the national \u2018opt-out\u2019 clauses often used by cer- tain Member States, and stresses that those in need of international protection should always be able to enter EU territory, irrespective of the level of tighter controls, and that the right to lodge an asylum application should be respected, whatever the form. The Committee defends the principle of access to a fair, ef- fective, individual reception and examination procedure, allowing for any judicial appeal against a negative decision to have the ef- fect of suspending repatriation, in- cluding claims made at the border. Anticipating the application of the humanitarian clause of the Dublin regulation, which allows asylum On 14 March 2008, the EESC host- ed the 10th European Consumer Day (ECD), organised in coopera- tion with the European Commis- sion and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU. This ma- jor event, held on the Committee\u2019s premises, focused this year on the topic of \u2018consumer redress\u2019. Open- ing the conference, EESC President Dimitris Dimitriadis underlined the importance of this year\u2019s ECD as the first of a series of events that will mark the 50th anniversary of the European Economic and Social Committee. \u2018Fifty years in which the Committee has given to the European legislators the view of society at large on proposed laws, but also, on its own initiative, the views on other issues of interest to European organisations.\u2019 Speaking on behalf of the Presi- dency of the Council of the EU, Mr Andrej Vizjak, Slovenian Min- ister for the Economy, placed the main emphasis on the importance of mechanisms for the out-of- court settlement of disputes as an alternative to formal proceedings, particularly court proceedings. The value of consumer disputes is often too low and waiting peri- ods too long for consumers to take cases to court. The President of the Competitiveness Council high- lighted the option of out-of-court settlement of consumer cases and the issue of collective solutions to consumer disputes at EU level. \u2018The Slovenian Presidency con- siders that collective consumer action would help improve the functioning of the internal mar- ket,\u2019 reported the minister. \u2018Con- sumer confidence in cross-border shopping would be increased if ef- ficient means to settle disputes as- sociated with their purchases were available.\u2019 In her address, the European Commissioner for Consumers, Ms Meglena Kuneva, stressed that \u2018consumers will not be able to enjoy the full benefits of the single mar- ket unless effective systems are in place to address their complaints and to give them the means for adequate redress\u2019. The Commis- sioner for Consumers referred to the need for consolidating exist- ing alternative dispute resolution (ADR) through the European consumer centres network, and seekers to choose the country to which they submit their claim, and taking account of the harmonisa- tion of the procedure, the Eurodac data system and the new directives adopted in parallel in the field of immigration, should suffice to pre- vent \u2018asylum shopping\u2019. In short, the Committee is proud to support the adoption of a fair asylum system, with a human face, that takes account of asylum seekers\u2019 need for protection as a genuine objective to be included among the objectives for building a Europe with a social aspect. (cid:76) The future of the single market \u2014 going global In order for the EU to be- come more competitive on the global stage, the remaining internal bar- riers in the single market should be removed. The EESC urges the Commis- sion and Member States to heed the recommenda- tions of the social partners in their joint review and analysis of the key chal- lenges facing the Euro- pean labour markets. In particular, the Committee sup- ports the four strategies agreed then for both the Union and the Member States: R & D and innovation: the right business environment, investment in people, energy and climate change. The EESC calls upon the Commission and the Council to ensure that social partners are closely in- volved in the design and implementation of the \u2018flexicurity\u2019 policy measures at national level. Reduction of CO 2 emissions from airports through new airport management The draft EESC opinion encourages airports to adopt management strat- egies for the reduction of CO 2 emissions through the introduction of an air quality model where all sources of NOx are iden- tified and targets for CO 2 reduction are established. The use of renewable en- ergy sources and of environmentally friendly service vehi- cles at airports is encouraged. Emissions reduction should take a systemic approach: while preserving safety as the top priority all factors must be considered, including air- frame and engine design and operations, trade-offs, alter- native fuels, ground services, airport capacity and air traffic management. The draft opinion supports the adoption of aircraft noise classification schemes and associated noise quota schemes at airports. Geographical indications and designations The EESC stresses that ge- ographical indications and designations (GI) must increasingly be counted among the essential rural development tools, be- ing used in tandem with second-pillar measures at every possible oppor- tunity, particularly where the countries which have recently joined the EU and disadvantaged areas in general are concerned. The EESC feels that the GI scheme \u2014 seen as an opportunity for rural development \u2014 must meet con- sumers\u2019 growing ethical, social, environmental and other expectations. Referring to the efficiency of the scheme, the opinion emphasises the need for further modification of the legislative framework relating to disputes, in order to prevent or to handle these problems and to avoid lengthy, exhausting court battles, for example by requiring Member States to act when Community rules have been breached.

The Commission is currently running a public con- sultation on the benchmarks that a collective redress system should respect, in order to ensure satis- factory redress for consumers. A communication on this topic should come out by the end of 2008/early 2009. The Commission- er, nevertheless, explicitly excluded any European system similar to American class actions. Rounding off a whole week of events devoted to major consumer issues, the 10th edition of the ECD was a major success, welcoming on the EESC premises more than 250 participants representing ex- perts, consumer organisations and other stakeholders from all over Europe.

This meeting brought together representatives from the 15 African economic and social councils be- longing to UCESA, the diplomatic representatives of these countries, and representatives from the Inter- national Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions (AICESIS). (cid:76) EESC President Dimitris Dimitriadis and UCESA President Thomas Sanon The public hearing on \u2018The current state of European self- and co- regulation\u2019, organised by the EESC Single Market Observatory (SMO), on 31 March 2008 in Brussels, demonstrated the vivid interest of civil society organisations in alternative instruments to \u2018hard law\u2019. Some 130 participants from all sectors of activity and from the EU institutions engaged in a lively debate on the impact of self- and co-regulation on the EU regulatory framework and the role of organised civil society as code-owners, i.e. initiators of self- and co-regulatory actions and, as such, actors of the legislative process. Key speakers to the event included Mr Bernardo Hern\u00e1ndez Bataller, Chairman of the EESC INT Section, Mr Alexander Italianer, Deputy Secretary-General of the European Commission in charge of better regulation, Mr Pavel Teli\u010dka, member of the High-Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens and senior adviser to the European Policy Centre (EPC). The open debate was led by Professor Fabrizio Cafaggi, from the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, and Mr Oliver Gray, Director-General of the European Alliance for Standards in Advertising (EASA). Mr Jorge Pegado Liz, Chairman of the SMO, closed the hearing in focusing on the role of the EESC in better regulation issues. IN BRIEF Mr Teli\u010dka, Mr Italianer and Mr Hern\u00e1ndez Bataller EESC is taking to the high seas: a daring journey around Europe is about to begin\u2026 On the occasion of the 50th an- niversary of the Committee, the EESC has become one of the pri- mary patrons for the sailing vessel known as Trait\u00e9 de Rome in the con- text of the project \u2018Sail for Europe\u2019. Over a six-month period, this ves- sel will travel to different destina- tions in Europe. Departure is fore- seen in mid-April from Dunkirk to reach Kiel and then Gdansk. The sailing boat will then head south- west to reach Rotterdam (20 May), Scheveningen (24 May), Ostend (28 May), London, Cowes, Brest, La Rochelle, Porto, Lisbon, Cartagena and Malta. It will reach Thessalo- niki on 5 September where it will be welcomed by EESC President Dimitriadis. It will then head west to reach Rome, Castillon, Marseille and Port Napol\u00e9on before finally being transported by truck to be present at the \u2018Salon nautique de Paris 2008\u2019, around the end of October, at the invitation of the Conf\u00e9dera- tion europ\u00e9enne des industries nautiques during the French Presi- dency of the EU. In addition to being prominent in all the ports, with the display of banners and documentation, the Committee retains exclusivity in four ports: Rotterdam, Scheveningen, Ostend and Thessaloniki (two days). In the context of the EC initiative \u2018going local\u2019, EESC members will wel- come the vessel in the ports, and promote the Committee alongside the European project. The presence of Jillian Van Turnhout during the signature on Tuesday 11 March was as sig- nificant as it was symbolic. The Sail for Europe project kicks off a se- ries of planned events marking the EESC\u2019s 50th anniversary culminat- ing in the 28 May celebrations. On this day, the sailing boat Treaty of Rome will dock in Ostend to mark the occasion. You will be able to follow the boat\u2019s entire journey on the Inter- net as it sails along the European coastline. It will prominently carry the Committee\u2019s 50th anniversary logo \u2014 a feature well known to all of us by now. Our Committee has been influential for half a century in establishing a \u2018bridge\u2019 between organised civil society and Eu- ropean citizens \u2014 a role which it hopes to continue well into the future. Sail for Europe contributes to carrying this message. As the president of the Sail for Europe association said: \u2018Today we are set- ting sail again because we think we can make a renewed contribution to Europe: sending a message to its citizens through our sporting exploits and burnishing the image of the European ideal!\u2019 President Van Turnhout and the \u2018Sail for Europe\u2019 team For further information: http://www.sailforeurope.eu/index. php?lang_name=en (cid:76) The EESC at the heart of self- and co-regulation in Europe Spring Day Europe 2008! Spring Day Europe 2008 takes its inspiration from the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and as such aims to promote intercultural dialogue and raise awareness among young people of cultural diversity, a major asset of our European cultural heritage. The key objective of the 2008 campaign is to prepare and help schools to plan, organise and manage their own events to celebrate the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. A range of activities and events are expected to be held at local, national and European levels. The Spring Day Europe team invites you to visit between 25 March and 30 June 2008 a school in your country, region, town or village to discuss Europe and your work with young Europeans. We urge you to take part in this unique event and encourage pupils and teachers from different cultural backgrounds to engage in constructive dialogue so that people can learn more about each other and put an end to prejudice and stereotyping. You can play a part in introducing young Europeans to different cultures and help them get ready for tomorrow\u2019s challenges!

The EESC members met the President of the Moldovan Parliament, Marian Lupu, the vice-ministers for foreign affairs, economy and social protection, relevant economic and social partners as well as the main national NGOs (social and environmental organisations). The EESC offered its expertise and support to Moldovan civil society organisations. The EESC held a workshop in Chisinau to present the new opinion on \u2018EU\u2013Moldova relations: what role for civil society?\u2019 Some 80 representatives from both civil society and public authorities attended the meeting. A debate on how to better involve civil society in EU\u2013Moldova relations took place. Evelyne Pichenot, the EESC rapporteur, recommended to civil society representatives to keep and develop contacts with the European institutions, pointing out that only a more proactive cooperation among all stakeholders will allow Moldova to quickly progress on its way to a social market economy.
