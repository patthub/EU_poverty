        "3 10 years of the European Employment Strategy Against a backdrop of high unemployment, the European Council launched the Euro- pean Employment Strategy (EES) at the Luxembourg Jobs Summit in November 1997. This paved the way for Member States and the Commission, through cooperation and sharing of experiences, to reach common targets and objectives for more and better jobs in Europe. At the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 the European Union set itself a new strategic goal for the following decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The focus of the EES shifted from reducing unemployment to regaining the conditions for full employment. In 2005, the European Council and Commission agreed that the Lisbon Strategy needed to be amended and centered on growth and jobs. Refocusing Lisbon brought about the need for more and better jobs. As a result the EES came into the very heart of European policy priorities. Today, ten years after its launch, the EES is a benchmark. It has been the model for several open methods of coordination including social protection and education and training, but above all it has achieved concrete results at the forefront of European citizens\u2019 concerns. Since 1997, the employment rates of older workers, women, as well as the overall rates, have risen substantially while both unemployment and long- term unemployment rates have fallen signi fi cantly (the latter by about a third). This success cannot all be attributed to the EES, but a substantial part can: employment performance is better because Member States can better enact their employment policies and learn from each other how to achieve common targets. I believe that the European Employment Strategy is one of the key successes of the Union. I am sure it will continue to help bring more and better jobs to Europeans. I have every hope that a second decade will be even more successful than the fi rst, enabling us to reach the EU\u2019s employment targets set for female and older workers and subsequently the overall employment rate target of 70%. I also look forward to a continued commitment to active inclusion policies contributing to both increased labour supply and strengthened society\u2019s cohesiveness.

        "5 Introduction Introduction Since its launch in 1997, the European Employ- ment Strategy (EES) has played a central role in coordinating the EU\u2019s policies in order to cre- ate improved work for all. Its role has been un- derscored by the European Council on many occasions and it has become an essential tool to respond to one of EU citizens\u2019 main preoc- cupations: more and better jobs. The EES is designed to give direction to and en- sure co-ordination of the employment policy priorities to which Member States subscribe at EU level. Heads of State and Government agreed on a framework for action around com- mon objectives and employment policy priori- ties. This co-ordination of national employment policies at EU level is built around an annual process laid down in the EU Treaty revision of 1998, which was integrated in a renewable three-year cycle since the re-launch of the Lis- bon Strategy in 2005. Employment Guidelines, which are adopted every year by the Council upon a proposal from the Commis- sion. The Guidelines re fl ect common priorities for Member States\u2019 employ- ment policies. Since 2005, they are part of the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs. National Reform Programmes, which Member States draw up in order to implement these Guidelines into na- tional policy. Until 2005, the employ- ment parts of these programmes were known as National Action Plans for Employment. Joint Employment Reports, adopted by the Commission and Council, which reviews the progress made at both national and community lev- els in response to the Employment Guidelines. Since 2005, the Joint Employment Report constitutes the employment chapter of the EU An- nual Progress Report on the Lisbon Strategy. Country Speci fi c Recommendations. The Council can also adopt, upon a proposal by the Commission, coun- try-speci fi c recommendations on employment policies which need to be considered by Member States in drawing up their National Reform Programmes. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ",
        "10 years of the European Employment Strategy 6 In its fi rst decade, the EES has seen the EU\u2019s employment rate increase from 60.7% to 64.3% (see chart 3), within which the employment rate for women has risen from 51.8% to 57.1% and the one for older workers (aged 55-64) from 35.7% to 43.5%. Even bigger improvements in the employment rates have been seen for those Member States that have bene fi ted longest from the EES. Unemploy- ment rates have varied over the ten years with big decreases prior to 2001, a rise between 2001 and 2004 \u2014 especially in the new Mem- ber States \u2014 and a decline after 2004. Struc- tural reforms in labour markets seem to have borne fruit. This is re fl ected in a reduction of the long term unemployment rate from about 5% to 3.6% (see chart 6) and shorter average periods of unemployment. of the European Employment Strategy 10 YEARS ",
        "The institutional structure of the European Employment Strategy 7 1. The institutional structure of the European Employment Strategy 1.1 Origins In the 1990s, a political consensus developed around the structural nature of Europe\u2019s em- ployment problem and on the need to increase the employment intensity of growth 1 . Both the monetary stabilisation policy, followed to prepare for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and the common nature of the employ- ment and unemployment challenges, called for a more co-ordinated employment oriented policy response at European level. Debate began during the negotiation of the Maastricht Treaty (1992), which strengthened the social dimension of the European model through a social protocol. This in turn led to the agreement at the Amsterdam European Council (1997) on new employment provi- sions in the Treaty. While con fi rming national competence for employment policy, employ- ment was declared in Article 126 of the Treaty 1 Cf. the Delors White Book on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, 1993 Article 128 TEC: framework for shared employment priorities Under this framework, policy co-ordination is fostered by a \u201cmanagement by objectives\u201d approach. Accordingly, European Employ- ment Guidelines are decided each year by the Council following a proposal from the Commission; these Guidelines have to be taken into account in national action plans (NAPs), which are assessed through the Joint Employment Report from the Commission and the Council, with a view to set the next annual guidelines. Since 2000, the Coun- cil, following a proposal from the Commis- sion, issues speci fi c recommendations to Member States, in order to complement the Employment Guidelines. The \u201cmanagement by objectives\u201d approach is also supported by the setting of measurable targets at EU or national level in a number of areas, as well as by the progressive development of statistical indicators \u2014 agreed between the Commission and Member States \u2014 to measure progress.

Largely inspired by the Treaty\u2019s provisions on economic policy co-or- dination 2 and by the co-ordination of employment policies launched at the Essen European Council of 1994, the new Article 128 TEC instituted a frame- work for developing national employment policies on the basis of shared European priori- ties and interests. Implementation of the EES allowed for a number of approaches and called for the involvement of all actors, namely national governments, EU institutions, social partners, civil society, aca- demics, etc. This is in accordance with the wide range of national institutional set-up and social dialogue practices. The openness of the co-ordi- nation process led, inter alia, to calls on social partners, both at national and EU level, to de- velop speci fi c actions and initiatives to develop regional and local involvement. Since the Am- sterdam Treaty, the European Parliament, other Community institutions and the Employment Committee have also played an active part in the development of the Employment Guidelines. of the European Employment Strategy 10 YEARS 2 Art. 98 and 99 TEC ",
        "9 The institutional structure of the European Employment Strategy In anticipation of entry into force of the Amster- dam Treaty, the Luxem- bourg Jobs Summit (No- vember 1997) launched the implementation of the new, open method of co-ordination embedded in Article 128 TEC and endorsed the fi rst set of Employment Guidelines. These guidelines were presented under four integrated strands of action, or the so-called pillars of the Employment Guidelines: employ- ability, entrepreneurship, adaptability, and equal opportunities. These actions constituted a comprehensive response to the employment challenge, integrating essential supply and de- mand oriented policies. \u00a9 G e t t y i m a g e s ",
        "10 10 years of the European Employment Strategy 1.2 The Amsterdam Treaty: mainstreaming employment While the Amsterdam Treaty did not change the basic principle of the Member States hav- ing the sole competence for employment pol- icy, it entrusted the Council and the European Commission with a stronger role, new tasks and more forceful tools. It also integrated the European Parliament more closely into the decision making process. The responsibilities of the Social Partners and their possibilities to contribute are also enhanced through the in- clusion of the Social Protocol into the Treaty. Beyond the overall strengthening of the Com- munity approach to employment, the key el- ements of the Amsterdam Treaty in this area were the following: 1. It spelled out the commitment to achieve a high level of employment as one of the key objectives of the European Union. It also declared that this objective is equally im- portant as the macroeconomic objectives of growth and stability. The importance of the employment objective was further en- hanced by the fact that the Employment ar- The EES in action Employment expansion of 18 million The employment situation in the EU has witnessed a clear improvement since the inception of the European Employment Strategy in 1997. Between 1997 and 2006 the overall employment rate has increased from 60.7% to 64.3% (see charts 1 and 3). Especially since the revision of the strategy in 2005, employment growth has picked up resulting in increasing employment rates and declining unemployment rates (includ- ing long term unemployment). Importantly, the increase in employment and participa- tion rates in the EU has demonstrated less sensitivity to cyclical conditions. This re- fl ects both the effects of reforms and long- lasting socio-economic change. The former is also shown by an increase in the employ- ment rate of 5.3 percentage points for the Member States which launched the EES in 1997. It should be noted, also, that em- ployment rates vary considerably between Member States ranging from 54.5% in Po- land to 77.4% in Denmark (see chart 3). ",

The EES has recognised the key role of so- cial partners in a wide range of areas related to employment. While the initial guidelines referred to the social partners in relation to their speci fi c area of adaptability, their wider role and recognition was acknowledged after the Lisbon Summit. The involvement of social partners in the preparation of the NAPs at na- tional level has improved steadily. European social partners engaged in their own processes of implementation around key issues such as lifelong learning. The EES has supported the development of a territorial dimension to employment policies, as demonstrated by the emergence of territo- rial action plans (see section 3.4). Local and regional authorities, whether as social serv- ice providers or local employers, have in- creasingly become partners in implementing employment policies, not least through the use of the European Social Fund, the priori- ties of which were aligned to the EES in 2000 (see section 3.7).

Co-operation between the Commission and the Council, notably via the Employment Committee, has been strength- ened as a result. The European Parliament was closely involved in the annual review process and thereby contributed to the development of the strategy, while the other institutions also made valuable contributions. Public employ- ment services, represented in an active EU level network, have been strongly mobilised around EU priorities. 4 E.g. the Employment Committee, the Economic Policy Committee and the Social Protection Committee ",

Also, the focus was shifted from the reduction of unemployment to regaining the conditions of full employment and that the overall aim should be to raise the EU employment rate to 70% and increase the number of employed women in to more than 60% by 2010. 5 http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/employment_ strategy/index_en.htm 6 To be compared with the US where the unemployment rate continued to fall and was at 4.6% in 2006. 7 Source \u201cEmployment in Europe 2005\u201d, chapter 2 The EES in action Higher labour market participation, slower progress on unemployment The increase in employment rates from 1997-2006 mainly re fl ects higher labour market participation (see chart 4 showing a 3.7 percentage point increase for the EU15 and 2.8 points in the EU25). The improve- ments in the unemployment rate were more modest; down from 9.8% to 7.4% for the EU15 and from 9.3% to 7.9% for the EU25 6 (see charts 2, 3 and 5) and the issue of youth employment remains a major concern (see section 3.3). Structural improvements in the functioning of labour markets are re fl ected in lower structural unemployment rates; increased ef fi ciency in matching between the unemployed and un fi lled vacancies; wage formation processes that take bet- ter account of prevailing conditions in the economy and competitiveness constraints; development of certain types of labour con- tracts (part-time and temporary work) that are positively correlated with employment creation; and expenditure on Active La- bour Market Policies (ALMPs) that has been increased and better targeted 7 .

Subsequent European Councils recommended new or strengthened priori- ties such as quality in work (Nice, Decem- ber 2000), active ageing and lifelong learn- ing (Barcelona, March 2002). These priorities were integrated into the annual Employment Guidelines together with the employment rate targets. \u00a9 P u n c h s t o c k ",

Considerable progress was noted in terms of job creation, curbing long term unemployment, reducing taxation of low paid labour, and spreading lifelong learning and equal opportunity policies for women and men. However, it became clear that the Strat- egy needed to be more focused on priorities and improved governance. The 2003 Employ- ment Guidelines were therefore articulated on the three overarching priorities of full employ- ment, quality in work and social inclusion, as well as a number of newly quanti fi ed targets (notably in the fi eld of lifelong learning). Later that year, a taskforce headed by Wim Kok, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, was charged with carrying out an independ- ent in-depth examination of key employment- related policy challenges. The taskforce was to identify practical reform measures that would have the most direct and immediate impact on the ability of Member States to implement the revised European Employment Strategy and to achieve its objectives and targets.

The taskforce also sought more effective management of labour migration in view of a shrink- ing working age population and the need to improve labour market integration of non-EU nationals.

        "10 years of the European Employment Strategy 22 2.4 Globalisation and an ageing Europe: revising the Lisbon Strategy In the beginning of 2005, the EU was (and still largely is) facing serious structural dif fi culties. An ageing population and a decline in eco- nomic performance have led to a strong pres- sure on the European social model. It was in this context that the European Commission proposed to revamp the Lisbon Strategy to focus on delivering stronger, longer-lasting growth and more and better jobs. This included a complete revision and integration of macro- economic, micro-economic and employment policy reform strands (and open methods of coordination), with the aim to maximise the synergies at the national level and Community actions, and to increase their ef fi ciency. This process saw the approval by the Euro- pean Council of the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (2005-2008). The eight Em- ployment Guidelines are now part of a pack- age of 24 guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, in conjunction with the macro-economic and mi- cro-economic guidelines (formally the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines) for a period of three years. The EES in action Employment rate growth driven by women and older workers While both genders and all main age groups participated in the job creation in the EU25 over the past ten years, the strongest growth was recorded in the employment rates for women (6.2 percentage points) and older workers (7.9 percentage points). In terms of the net increase in employment, women accounted for 62%, and with regard to age groups, older workers (aged 55-64) around a quarter (see charts 7 and 8). \u00a9 G e t t y i m a g e s - H a n s H e l e m a n ",

Features of the EES 3.1 The social dimension An increase in employment rates is a prereq- uisite for being able to maintain and increase Europe\u2019s prosperity and for preserving and enhancing our social models in a changing world. Maintaining such values requires con- stant adaptation to the new environment gen- erated by greater international competition, the demographic situation and the shift to a new paradigm based on knowledge. There is no necessary trade-off between the economic and the social dimension, neither between ef- fi ciency and equity issues, nor between pro- ductivity and employment. The purpose of the EES is to ensure that all these common con- cerns are addressed simultaneously in a coher- ent and comprehensive policy package.

Moreover, social inequities in the form of social exclusion and their related compensatory measures have huge hidden costs which are rarely shown in public accounting systems. Therefore, if we forget the social dimension of the Lisbon Strat- egy, we risk incurring huge corrective costs lat- er on and endanger the fi nancial sustainability of our countries. Moreover, while growth is an essential com- ponent of the European Social Model, growth alone is not an ef fi cient instrument to fi ght against poverty and social exclusion, unless it comes with falling inequality. Economic growth and even job creation do not lead automatically to reduced income disparities, in-work poverty, or regional disparities. In- work poverty is linked to low pay, low skills, precarious and often undesired part-time em- ployment. To create a sustainable way out of poverty and to contribute to economic growth and competitiveness, better quality jobs are required as well as enhanced investments in human and social capital. Within the EES (and the ESF) action has been pursued to reduce regional disparities in terms of employment, unemployment and labour productivity, espe- cially in regions lagging behind. ",

Europe needs to step up its efforts to improve both the ef fi ciency and the equity of its edu- cation and training systems. Education and training policies should increase ef fi ciency by raising the average skill level in the population to ensure a better match between skills and la- bour market needs and therefore raise both employability and productivity. They should also reduce inequality by improving the employment perspec- tives of those most in need, includ- ing the disadvantaged and the immi- grants. This would allow education and training systems to contribute to activation and cohesion measures to ensure that all citizens can play their full part in society and the economy over the whole life cycle, e.g. through lifelong learning policies. These are not mutu- ally exclusive objectives, since achieving high quality and excellence does not necessarily mean sacri fi cing equitable opportunities, ac- cess, treatment and outcomes for individual Europeans. \u00a9 S h u t t e r s t o c k ",

This re fl ects the in- creased focus on investments in human capital and the reinforced efforts to build employment pathways for young people and to promote ef- fi cient lifelong learning strategies. However, youth unemployment remains a key concern for Europe: today it stands at 17.4%. Over the last 25 years, no real breakthrough has been achieved in reducing youth unemployment.

Re fl ecting this, the share of highly-skilled non-manual workers in the overall EU15 occupational structure has increased from about 36% in 1997 to al- most 40% in 2006. Correspondingly, both the shares of low-skilled non-manual and skilled manual workers have decreased and only the elementary occupations recorded a slight increase from about 9% to 10%. 10 The youth education attainment level is the percentage of young people aged 20-24 having attained at least an upper secondary education (ISCED level 3). \u00a9 P u n c h s t o c k ",

According to the EU Labour Force Survey of the rise in employment in the EU15 between 1997 and 2006, around 6 million jobs came from real estate renting and business activities, and some 4 million from health and social work. Strong employment increases of over 2 million were also recorded in wholesale and retail trade, construction and educa- tion. In contrast, both agriculture and man- ufacturing have seen employment drop by more than 1 million. ",

        "30 10 years of the European Employment Strategy 3.5 Free movement: a European Pillar Free movement of labour is seen as a way of promoting labour market ef fi ciency by im- proving the matching of the available labour supply to the demand from employers. Mo- bility is driven by both the desire of work- ers to improve their economic situation and companies\u2019 search for workers to meet their requirements for labour. Greater labour force mobility, both between jobs (job mobility) and within and between countries (geographic mobility) can help the European economy and la- bour force to adapt to changing conditions more smoothly and ef fi ciently, as well as respond to change in the competitive glo- bal economy. However, while mobility is widely regarded as a positive feature of the labour market, actual mobility levels within Europe have remained comparatively low with fewer than 2% of all EU citizens living in another EU Member State. \u00a9 P u n c h s t o c k ",

As freedom of movement is one of the key principles of European integration, the Commission welcomed the fact that many Member States have opened their labour mar- kets completely since the enlargement in May 2004 and that other Member States have sim- pli fi ed their existing national access regimes or procedures to varying degrees. The EES in action Closing the employment gap with US and Japan The sustained employment growth over the last decade helped the EU narrow the gap against both the US and Japan. While in 1997 the EU15 employment rate trailed 12.8 percentage points behind the US and 9.3 points behind Japan, by 2005 the gap had more than halved to 6.3 and 4.1 points, respectively (see chart 1).

        "32 10 years of the European Employment Strategy 3.6 Flexicurity: a new perspective on working life Ten years on, in 2007, the European labour market continues to change. Four main rea- sons can be highlighted: European and inter- national economic integration; the rapid de- velopment of new technologies, particularly in the information and communication areas; the demographic ageing of European societies, together with still relatively low average em- ployment rates and too high long-term unem- ployment, which put at risk the sustainability of social protection systems; and the develop- ment of segmented labour markets in many countries where both relatively protected and unprotected workers coexist (\u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d). In order to achieve the Lisbon objectives of more and better jobs, new forms of fl exibil- ity and security are needed for individuals of all ages and companies as well as for Mem- ber States and the EU. Individuals increas- ingly need employment security rather than job security, as fewer have the same job for life. Companies, including the many SMEs in The EES in action Higher prevalence of part-time and fi xed-term work More fl exible forms of employment have clearly made a strong contribution to em- ployment expansion, with part-time ac- counting for over half the overall increase. Atypical forms of employment, namely part-time and fi xed-term employment, have consequently become more prevalent in the EU25 over the period. The share of part-time employment in total employment has grown from 16% in 1997 to 18.8% in 2006, and the share of fi xed-term contracts among employees from 11.7% to 14.9% (see chart 9). ",

        "34 10 years of the European Employment Strategy At the European Council in Finland in 2006, an informal Tripartite Social Summit took place. During this summit the need to adapt to globalisation and change the perspective towards working life in order to fi nd a balance between fl exibility and security where economic ef fi ciency and social justice can co-exist was stressed. A Communication entitled \u201cTowards common principles of fl exicurity\u201d was adopted by the Commission in June 2007. Its purpose is to fa- cilitate a comprehensive debate between EU Institutions, Member States, social partners and other stakeholders, so that the European Council may adopt a set of common princi- ples of fl exicurity by the end of 2007. These common principles should then inspire and contribute to the implementation of the Inte- grated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs, and in particular the Employment Guidelines.

        "37 Features of the EES 3.7 The role of the European Social Fund (ESF) At the Berlin European Council in 1999, the mission and priorities of the ESF were rede- fi ned and its fi nancial \u201cenvelope\u201d set at \u20ac60 billion for the period 2000-2006. The ESF has supported important priorities of the EES including active labour market policies, the development of human resources, the integra- tion of vulnerable groups and gender equality on the labour market. Through the ESF opera- tional programmes agreed between the Euro- pean Commission and the Member States, the support to national employment policies was conditioned by their consistency with the EES priorities. For the programming period 2007-2013 (with a fi nancial envelope of \u20ac70 billion for the ESF), the ESF priorities have been further synchro- nised with those of the EES. The measures that fall within the Employment Guidelines (includ- ing a range of fl exicurity policies) are eligible for ESF support, and in many cases the Europe- an Regional Development Fund can also pro- vide fi nancial support. Among the actions that can be funded are training at company level and active labour market measures, includ- ing job- fi nding assistance of the unemployed, lifelong learning and the promotion of self-em- ployment and entrepreneurship. \u00a9 P u n c h s t o c k ",
