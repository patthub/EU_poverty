        "Fundamental rights: challenges and achievements in 2010 ANNUAL REPORT d o i : 10 . 2811 / 25695 T K - A G - 11 - 001 - E N - C F u n d a m e n t a l r i g h t s : c h a ll e n g e s a n d a c h i e v e m e n t s i n 2010 2010 marked the first year the European Union (EU) operated on the basis of a legally binding bill of rights \u2013 the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. This year\u2019s annual report of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights puts the spotlight on the achievements and challenges of the EU and its Member States as they strive to inject robust life into their fundamental rights commitments. Steps forward in 2010 included, among many, the reinforcement of a fundamental rights check of EU legislative proposals and the adoption of the regulation on the Citizens\u2019 Initiative \u2013 an important new EU participatory democracy tool. Moves by several Member States to strengthen or create National Human Rights Institutions or the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) by the EU complemented this picture. Still, there is no room for complacency. The EU continues to face various issues of concern in the fundamental rights field, such as persisting and extreme poverty as well as social exclusion among Roma communities and deteriorating conditions of asylum seekers in certain Member States. In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights delivered over 600 judgments for violations of human rights against almost all 27 EU Member States. This report examines progress on EU and Member State rights obligations under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, covering the following topics: situation of Roma in the EU; asylum immigration and integration; border control and visa policy; information society and data protection; the rights of the child and protection of children; equality and non-discrimination; racism and ethnic discrimination; participation of EU citizens in the Union\u2019s democratic functioning; access to efficient and independent justice; and victims\u2019 protection.

treaty base provided by the Treaty of Lisbon set the scene for the work of the European Union (EU) in 2010. Various components of this treaty promise a more fundamental rights-orientated and more accessible EU. Indeed, during 2010 the major EU institutions highlighted the importance of fundamental rights in the context of legislation undertaken at EU level. The FRA Annual Report identifies challenges and achievements as they emerged in 2010. Its chapters cover the nine areas identified by the Agency\u2019s Multi-annual Framework 2007-2012. Chapter 10 is new and provides an overview of international obligations relevant to the areas of EU law covered in this report.

However, the Charter does not apply to all situations in which fundamental rights are at issue in the European Union. In 2010, the Commission received more than 4,000 letters from the general public regarding fundamental rights. Approximately three quarters of these concerned cases outside the remit of EU law. This reflects a frequent misunderstanding about the purpose of the Charter and the situations where the Charter applies or does not apply. ... The Charter applies to actions by all EU institutions and bodies. It concerns in particular the legislative work of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. \u2026 The Charter applies to Member States only when they are implementing EU law.\u201d European Commission, 2010\ufeffReport\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffapplication\ufeff of\ufeffthe\ufeffEU\ufeffCharter\ufeffof\ufeffFundamental\ufeffRights , p. 3 ",

The fact that the right to free movement and residence of European Union (EU) citizens of Roma origin was called into question generated widespread public and political debate over the situation of one of Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minorities, the Roma minority, and the fulfilment of their fundamental rights. In its determination to weave fundamental rights into the fabric of EU law, the European Commission sent strong political signs in 2010 in relation to Roma, not least in setting up a Roma Task Force in September 2010.

The EU asylum system allows those facing the risk of serious harm in their home country to apply for international protection. However, progress in legislative reforms leading to the creation of a Common European Asylum System by 2012 has been slow. Concurrently, Greece was confronted with unprecedented pressures on its asylum system, challenging its ability to implement human rights guarantees. Furthermore, a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) raised questions about the operability of the Dublin II Regulation. Regarding the integration of migrants, a trend emerged of tying the granting of permanent residence for legally-residing non-EU nationals to integration requirements. 1 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffasylum,\ufeff immigration\ufeffand\ufeffintegration: \u2022\ufeff \ufeffprovisions\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffQualification\ufeffDirective, 2 \ufeffrelating\ufeffto\ufeffeligibility\ufeff for,\ufeffand\ufeffthe\ufeffgranting\ufeffand\ufeffwithdrawal\ufeffof\ufeffrefugee\ufeffstatus,\ufeffwere\ufeff clarified\ufeffby\ufeffjudgments\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffCourt\ufeffof\ufeffJustice\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeff European\ufeffUnion\ufeff(CJEU); \u2022\ufeff \ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffat\ufeffthe\ufeffEU\u2019s\ufeffexternal\ufeffborders\ufefffaced\ufeffdifficulties\ufeff in\ufeffguaranteeing\ufefffundamental\ufeffrights\ufeffwhere\ufeffthey\ufeff experienced\ufeffincreased\ufeffinflows\ufeffof\ufeffmigrants,\ufeffin\ufeffparticular\ufeff regarding\ufeffdetention\ufeffconditions\ufeffof\ufeffirregular\ufeffmigrants; \u2022\ufeff \ufefftransfers\ufeffof\ufeffasylum\ufeffseekers\ufeffto\ufeffGreece\ufeffunder\ufeffthe\ufeffDublin\ufeffII\ufeff Regulation\ufeffwere\ufeffsuspended\ufeffin\ufefforder\ufeffnot\ufeffto\ufeffpose\ufeffrisks\ufeffto\ufeffthe\ufeff fundamental\ufeffrights\ufeffof\ufeffthose\ufefftransferred; 3 \u2022\ufeff \ufeffdetention\ufeffconditions\ufefffor\ufeffirregular\ufeffmigrants,\ufeffincluding\ufefffor\ufeff those\ufeffwhose\ufeffasylum\ufeffclaims\ufeffhave\ufefffailed,\ufeffposed\ufeffissues\ufefffor\ufeff the\ufeffprotection\ufeffof\ufeffhuman\ufeffrights;\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffprotection\ufeffpractices\ufeffunder\ufeffreadmission\ufeffagreements\ufeffraised\ufeff concerns\ufeffas\ufeffregards\ufeffthe\ufeffprinciple\ufeffof\ufeff non-refoulement ; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffmore\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffintroduced\ufeffintegration\ufeffrequirements\ufeff as\ufeffa\ufeffcondition\ufeffof\ufeffgranting\ufeffpermanent\ufeffresidence\ufeffpermits;\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffa\ufefffew\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffdiscussed\ufeffgranting\ufeffmigrants\ufeffgreater\ufeff political\ufeffrights. 2\ufeff Council\ufeffDirective\ufeff2004/83/EC,\ufeffOJ\ufeff2004\ufeffL\ufeff304. 3\ufeff Council\ufeffRegulation\ufeff(EC)\ufeffNo.\ufeff343/2003\ufeffOJ\ufeff2003\ufeffL50,\ufeffp.\ufeff1. 1\ufeff European\ufeffCouncil\ufeff(2010).

Border control and visa policy With the notable exception of Greece, the European Union (EU) has seen an overall downward trend in irregular migration in 2010. However, the specific situation in Greece has raised concerns that those in need of asylum will be prevented from making their claims and that mistreatment awaits those who are returned. At a more general level, steps have been taken to enhance respect for fundamental rights during joint operations undertaken under the coordination of Frontex, including proposed amendments to Frontex\u2019s founding regulation to make explicit references to human rights. While the extension of visa-free travel has allowed easier entry and free movement within the EU for citizens of some non-EU countries, the establishment of databases containing personal information raises questions about the right to data protection. 2 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffborder\ufeffcontrol\ufeffand\ufeffvisa\ufeffpolicy:\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffcooperation\ufeffagreements\ufeffbetween\ufeffEU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffand\ufeffthird\ufeff states,\ufeffwhich\ufeffallow\ufefffor\ufeffinterception\ufeffand\ufeffreturn\ufeffof\ufeffmigrants\ufeffat\ufeff maritime\ufeffborders,\ufeffrisked\ufeffpreventing\ufeffthose\ufeffin\ufeffneed\ufeffof\ufeff international\ufeffprotection\ufefffrom\ufeffclaiming\ufeffasylum; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffsteps\ufeffwere\ufefftaken\ufeffto\ufeffensure\ufeffrespect\ufefffor\ufefffundamental\ufeffrights\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeff context\ufeffof\ufeffoperations\ufeffunder\ufeffthe\ufeffcoordination\ufeff\ufeff of\ufeffFrontex\ufeffat\ufeffthe\ufeffEU\u2019s\ufeffexternal\ufeffborders; \u2022\ufeff \ufefffor\ufeffthe\ufefffirst\ufefftime,\ufeffFrontex\ufeffdeployed\ufeffRapid\ufeffBorder\ufeffIntervention\ufeff Teams\ufeff(Rabits)\ufeffat\ufeffthe\ufeffland\ufeffborder\ufeffwith\ufeffTurkey,\ufeff\ufeff at\ufeffthe\ufeffrequest\ufeffof\ufeffGreece; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffvisa-free\ufefftravel\ufeffwas\ufeffgranted\ufeffto\ufeffholders\ufeffof\ufeffbiometric\ufeffpassports\ufeff from\ufeffAlbania,\ufeffBosnia\ufeffand\ufeffHerzegovina\ufeffand\ufeffholders\ufeff\ufeff of\ufeffTaiwanese\ufeffpassports.\ufeff 2.1.1.

In 2010, data protection concerns were raised in a number of EU Member States in relation to these developments. Moreover, national security threats continued to have an impact on airport security in 2010, which led to a heated debate at European Union (EU) level as well as in some Member States, particularly in relation to the introduction of body scanners. The protection of personal data was at the forefront of many fundamental rights debates in the EU in 2010 including in relation to new technologies and proposals concerning the reform of the EU data protection framework, taking into account the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm Programme. 3 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffinformation\ufeff society\ufeffand\ufeffdata\ufeffprotection: \u2022\ufeff \ufeffnew\ufefftechnologies\ufeffraised\ufeffnew\ufefffundamental\ufeffrights\ufeffconcerns\ufeffand\ufeff led\ufeffto\ufeffcalls\ufefffor\ufeffa\ufeffmodernisation\ufeffof\ufeffEU\ufeffdata\ufeffprotection\ufefflegislation; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffconsensus\ufeffgrew\ufeffthat\ufeffdata\ufeffprotection\ufeffforms\ufeffa\ufeffkey\ufeffconcern\ufeffin\ufeff international\ufeffagreements,\ufeffespecially\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffcase\ufeffof\ufeffthose\ufeffdealing\ufeff with\ufeffPersonal\ufeffName\ufeffRecords\ufeff(PNR)\ufeffand\ufeffSwift; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffconcerns\ufeffwere\ufeffraised\ufeffat\ufeffpolitical\ufeffand\ufefflegal\ufefflevels\ufeffin\ufeffrelation\ufeffto\ufeff the\ufeffrise\ufeffin\ufeffcompulsory\ufeffretention\ufeffof\ufeffcommunication\ufeffdata\ufeff (telephone\ufeffand\ufeffInternet)\ufeffby\ufeffprivate\ufeffcompanies; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffindependence\ufeffof\ufeffdata\ufeffprotection\ufeffauthorities\ufeffbecame\ufeffan\ufeffissue\ufeff that\ufeffwas\ufeffdealt\ufeffwith\ufeffbefore\ufeffthe\ufeffCourt\ufeffof\ufeffJustice\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeff Union\ufeff(CJEU); \u2022\ufeff \ufeffpolitical\ufeffdebate\ufeffcontinued\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffimplications\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffuse\ufeffof\ufeffbody\ufeff scanners\ufeffas\ufeffsecurity\ufeffdevices\ufeffat\ufeffairports; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffbalance\ufeffbetween\ufeffdata\ufeffprotection\ufeffconcerns\ufeffand\ufeffthe\ufeffright\ufeffto\ufeff information\ufeffemerged\ufeffas\ufeffa\ufefftopic\ufeffand\ufeffwas\ufeffaddressed\ufeffbefore\ufeffthe\ufeffCJEU. regulated\ufeffby\ufeffthe\ufeffData\ufeffProtection\ufeffDirective. 1 \ufeffMoreover,\ufefffol- lowing\ufeffthe\ufeffadoption\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffLisbon\ufeffTreaty\ufeffin\ufeffDecember\ufeff2009,\ufeff European\ufeffCommission\ufeffVice-President\ufeffViviane\ufeffReding\ufeffidenti- fied\ufeffthe\ufeffprotection\ufeffof\ufeffpersonal\ufeffdata\ufeffof\ufeffEuropean\ufeffcitizens\ufeffas\ufeff a\ufeffpriority\ufeffpolicy\ufeffarea\ufeffin\ufeff2010. 1\ufeff Directive\ufeff95/46/EC,\ufeffOJ\ufeff1995\ufeffL\ufeff281,\ufeffpp.\ufeff31-50.

That independence precludes not only any influence exercised by the supervised bodies, but also any directions or any other external influence, whether direct or indirect, which could call into question the performance by those authorities of their task consisting of establishing a fair balance between the protection of the right to private life and the free movement of personal data.\u201d CJEU, C-518/07 Commission\ufeffv.\ufeffFederal\ufeffRepublic\ufeffof\ufeffGermany , 9 March 2010, paragraph 30.

The rights of the child and protection of children Children\u2019s rights form part of the fundamental rights that the European Union (EU) is committed to protect while respecting the jurisdiction of its Member States. According to the Lisbon Treaty, the EU shall promote the rights of the child. In 2010, EU action focused on implementing the Stockholm Programme, the EU\u2019s new justice strategy, primarily in regard to child protection. In early 2011, the European Commission released its Communication on an \u2018EU Agenda for the rights of the child\u2019, setting out a programme of action for the coming years. A key action item is to render justice systems more child friendly, turning the rights of the child into reality through EU legislation. However, many challenges remain, as there is evidence that the rights of children, in particular of those in a vulnerable situation, are not adequately protected. 4 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffchildren\u2019s\ufeffrights: \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffCommission\ufeffadopted\ufeffin\ufeffearly\ufeff2011\ufeffan\ufeffEU\ufeffAgenda\ufefffor\ufeffthe\ufeff rights\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffchild,\ufeffincluding\ufeff11\ufeffaction\ufeffpoints; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffagreement\ufeffwas\ufeffreached\ufeffat\ufeffEU\ufefflevel\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufefffinal\ufefftext\ufeffof\ufeffa\ufeffdirective\ufeffon\ufeff preventing\ufeffand\ufeffcombating\ufefftrafficking\ufeffin\ufeffhuman\ufeffbeings\ufeffand\ufeffprotecting\ufeff victims,\ufeffwhich\ufeffdevotes\ufeffparticular\ufeffattention\ufeffto\ufeffchild\ufeffprotection;\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffCouncil\ufeffof\ufeffEurope\ufeffadopted\ufeffGuidelines\ufeffon\ufeffchild-friendly\ufeff justice\ufeffand\ufeffa\ufeffrecommendation\ufeffon\ufeffde-institutionalisation\ufeffand\ufeff community\ufeffliving\ufeffof\ufeffchildren\ufeffwith\ufeffdisabilities; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffhotline\ufefffor\ufeffmissing\ufeffchildren,\ufeff116\ufeff000,\ufeffwas\ufeffin\ufeffoperation\ufeffin\ufeff only\ufeff13\ufeffEU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffworrying\ufeffresults\ufeffemerged\ufefffrom\ufeffinquiries\ufeffin\ufeffdifferent\ufeffEU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeff into\ufeffchild\ufeffabuse\ufeffcommitted\ufeffin\ufeffinstitutions\ufeffor\ufeffby\ufefftheir\ufeffstaff\ufeffmembers; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffFRA\ufefffindings\ufeffunderlined\ufeffthat\ufeffseparated\ufeffchildren\ufeffin\ufeffa\ufeff migration\ufeffor\ufeffasylum\ufeffcontext\ufeffare\ufeffoften\ufeffnot\ufeffappropriately\ufeff housed,\ufeffmedical\ufeffscreening\ufeffupon\ufeffarrival\ufeffis\ufeffnot\ufeffalways\ufeff accessible,\ufeffasylum\ufeffdetermination\ufeffprocedures\ufeffare\ufeffoften\ufeff not\ufeffchild\ufefffriendly,\ufeffand\ufeffthe\ufeffquality\ufeffof\ufeffguardianship\ufeff varies\ufeffsignificantly\ufeffamong\ufeffEU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates;\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthere\ufeffremained\ufeffa\ufefflack\ufeffof\ufeffcomprehensive\ufeffdisaggregated\ufeff data\ufeffregarding\ufeffchild\ufefftrafficking\ufefffor\ufeffsexual\ufeffor\ufefflabour\ufeff exploitation;\ufeffwhere\ufeffthey\ufeffare\ufeffrecorded,\ufeffthe\ufeffnumber\ufeffof\ufeff victims\ufeffof\ufefftrafficking\ufeffidentified\ufeffremained\ufeffvery\ufefflow.

Not to be discriminated against \u2013 be it on the basis of sex, religion, disability, sexual orientation or age \u2013 is a fundamental right that is of relevance to countless situations in daily life. Over the reporting period, the EU adopted directives on parental leave and on equality between self-employed men and women, while the European Commission established a new five-year strategy working toward equality between men and women. Member States introduced legislation to implement a number of EU equality directives. But despite this progress, challenges remain. Multiple discrimination, for example, remains a reality that is largely not mirrored by the legal framework of the EU. The Lisbon Treaty puts the EU under a new horizontal obligation to combat discrimination in all its policies and activities \u2013 a task that can contribute to more equal societies. 5 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffnon-discrimination: \u2022\ufeff \ufeffnegotiations\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeff\u2018horizontal\u2019\ufeffdirective\ufeffremained\ufeffongoing\ufeffin\ufeff\ufeff the\ufeffCouncil\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffUnion; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffEU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffcontinued\ufeffto\ufeffintroduce\ufeffnew\ufefflegislation,\ufeffas\ufeff well\ufeffas\ufeffamending\ufeffexisting\ufeffones,\ufeffto\ufefftranspose\ufeffthe\ufeffequality\ufeff directives,\ufeffnamely\ufeffthe\ufeffRacial\ufeffEquality\ufeffDirective,\ufeffEmployment\ufeff Equality\ufeffDirective,\ufeffGender\ufeffGoods\ufeffand\ufeffServices\ufeffDirective\ufeffand\ufeff Gender\ufeffEquality\ufeffDirective\ufeff(recast); \u2022\ufeff \ufefflevels\ufeffof\ufeffcomplaints\ufeffreceived\ufeffby\ufeffequality\ufeffbodies\ufeffremained\ufeffvaried\ufeff across\ufeffthe\ufeffEU.\ufeffDespite\ufeffan\ufeffincrease\ufeffin\ufeffcomplaints\ufeffreported\ufeffin\ufeff12\ufeff EU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates,\ufeffoverall\ufeffnumbers\ufeffappeared\ufefflow.\ufeffThe\ufeffmandates\ufeff of\ufeffsome\ufeffequality\ufeffbodies\ufeffwere\ufeffbroadened\ufeffto\ufeffinclude\ufeffmore\ufeff grounds\ufeffof\ufeffdiscrimination; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffdirectives\ufeffon\ufeffparental\ufeffleave\ufeffand\ufeffon\ufeffequality\ufeffbetween\ufeffself- employed\ufeffmen\ufeffand\ufeffwomen\ufeffwere\ufeffadopted,\ufeffas\ufeffwell\ufeffas\ufeffa\ufefffive-year\ufeff strategy\ufeffpromoting\ufeffequality\ufeffbetween\ufeffmen\ufeffand\ufeffwomen\ufeffcovering\ufeff the\ufeffperiod\ufeff2010-2015.\ufeffNegotiations\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffPregnant\ufeffWorkers\ufeff Directive\ufeffremained\ufeffongoing;\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffInstitute\ufefffor\ufeffGender\ufeffEquality\ufeff(EIGE)\ufeffwas\ufeffformally\ufeff opened; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffEU\ufeffratified\ufeffthe\ufeffUnited\ufeffNations\ufeffConvention\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffRights\ufeffof\ufeff Persons\ufeffwith\ufeffDisabilities\ufeff(CRPD),\ufeffas\ufeffdid\ufeffa\ufefffurther\ufefffour\ufeffMember\ufeff States\ufeffin\ufeff2010,\ufeffbringing\ufeffthe\ufefftotal\ufeffto\ufeff16\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffhaving\ufeff ratified\ufeffthe\ufeffconvention.\ufeffThe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffCommission\ufefflaunched\ufeffits\ufeff ",

At the same time, court cases and studies published in the European Union (EU) show that racism remains a significant problem in the areas of employment, healthcare, housing and education. Racially motivated crimes are committed every day on European soil. In order to fully understand the phenomenon of racism and ethnic discrimination, comprehensive and comparable data collection mechanisms would be helpful. However, overall progress in introducing such mechanisms remained slow, whereas at the same time efforts to promote equality with respect to racism and ethnic discrimination took place. 6 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffracism\ufeffand\ufeffethnic\ufeffdiscrimination:\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffdiscrimination\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffemployment\ufeffremained\ufeffprevalent,\ufeff with\ufeffcases\ufeffrelating\ufeffto\ufeffdiscrimination\ufeffin\ufeffjob\ufeffadvertisements,\ufeff recruitment\ufeffprocesses,\ufeffworking\ufeffconditions\ufeffand\ufeffdismissals; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffaccess\ufeffto\ufeffhealthcare\ufeffremained\ufeffdependent\ufeffon\ufeffefforts\ufeffto\ufeffovercome\ufeff language\ufeffbarriers\ufeffand\ufeffaccommodate\ufeffcultural\ufeffdiversity.\ufeffIn\ufeffthe\ufeffcase\ufeffof\ufeff irregular\ufeffmigrants,\ufeffaccess\ufeffhinged\ufeffupon\ufeffwhether\ufeffhealthcare\ufeffpersonnel\ufeff were\ufeffrequired\ufeffto\ufeffreport\ufeffundocumented\ufeffpersons\ufeffto\ufeffthe\ufeffauthorities;\ufeff \u2022\ufeff \ufeffalthough\ufeffformal\ufefflegal\ufeffand\ufeffadministrative\ufeffbarriers\ufeffto\ufeffaccessing\ufeff social\ufeffhousing\ufeffwere\ufeffpresent\ufeffin\ufeffonly\ufeffa\ufefffew\ufeffMember\ufeffStates,\ufeffavailable\ufeff evidence\ufeffsuggested\ufeffthat\ufeffminorities\ufeffcontinue\ufeffto\ufefflive\ufeffin\ufefflower-quality\ufeff housing\ufeffresulting\ufefffrom\ufeffboth\ufeffdirect\ufeffand\ufeffindirect\ufeffdiscrimination; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffsegregation\ufeffin\ufeffeducation\ufeffappeared\ufeffto\ufeffremain\ufeffa\ufeffproblem\ufeff affecting\ufeffmainly\ufeffRoma\ufeffchildren\ufeffin\ufeffsome\ufeffMember\ufeffStates.\ufeff Barriers\ufeffto\ufeffaccess\ufeffto\ufeffeducation\ufeffremained\ufefffor\ufeffchildren\ufeffof\ufeff undocumented\ufeffmigrants\ufeffin\ufeffsome\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffwhere\ufeff school\ufeffauthorities\ufeffare\ufeffobliged\ufeffto\ufeffcollect\ufeffinformation\ufeffand\ufeff report\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufefflegal\ufeffstatus\ufeffof\ufeffstudents\ufeffand\ufefftheir\ufeffparents; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffa\ufeffnumber\ufeffof\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffwere\ufeffbeginning\ufeffto\ufeffmove\ufeff towards\ufeffthe\ufeffcollection\ufeffof\ufeffdata\ufeffbroken\ufeffdown\ufeffby\ufeffrace\ufeffor\ufeff ethnicity,\ufeffwhich\ufeffis\ufeffan\ufeffimportant\ufeffdevelopment\ufeffin\ufeffan\ufeffeffort\ufeffto\ufeff record\ufeffand\ufeffidentify\ufeffpotentially\ufeffdiscriminatory\ufeffpractices; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffmost\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffthat\ufeffcollect\ufeffdata\ufeffon\ufeffracially\ufeffmotivated\ufeff crime\ufeffshowed\ufeffan\ufeffincrease\ufeffin\ufeffrecorded\ufeffnumbers.

FRA ACTIVITY \u201cThe more a group is marginalised, the more vulnerable it is. Nevertheless, being a migrant, from a certain ethnic group or a person with a disability does not make a person inherently more vulnerable or at increased risk. Rather, it is the interaction between several factors that creates increased vulnerability. These factors include poverty, inequality, discrimination, exposure to various threats (such as sexual abuse), the prevailing incidence or prevalence of disease (such as HIV) and the possibilities of epidemics (such as influenza).\u201d WHO Regional Office for Europe (2010) Interim first report on social determinants of health and the health divide in the WHO European Region ",

Participation of EU citizens in the Union\u2019s democratic functioning The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the now binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union have given new impetus to questions related to the participation of European Union (EU) citizens in the Union\u2019s democratic functioning. With the landmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in relation to the right to vote, this area of law will play a vital role in ensuring the participation of EU citizens. 2010 also witnessed more intensive discussions on the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative, which is a new and potentially powerful participatory tool at EU level. Though it is too early to evaluate the full impact of this new mechanism, the Citizens\u2019 Initiative should help bring EU citizens closer to the important issues of European integration. 7 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffparticipation: \u2022\ufeff \ufeffas\ufeffa\ufeffresult\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufefflow\ufeffparticipation\ufeffrates\ufeffof\ufeffnon-national\ufeff\ufeff EU\ufeffcitizens\ufeffin\ufeffmunicipal\ufeffand\ufeffEuropean\ufeffParliament\ufeffelections,\ufeff discussions\ufeffon\ufeffelectoral\ufeffreform\ufeffin\ufeffthis\ufeffarea\ufeffbegan; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffthe\ufeffECtHR\ufeffextended\ufeffits\ufeffcase\ufefflaw\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffright\ufeffto\ufefffree\ufeffelections\ufeff (Article\ufeff3\ufeffof\ufeffProtocol\ufeffNo.\ufeff1\ufeffto\ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffConvention\ufeffon\ufeff Human\ufeffRights\ufeff(ECHR)); \u2022\ufeff \ufefffollowing\ufeffpolitical\ufeffconsensus\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffCitizens\u2019\ufeffInitiative\ufeffRegulation\ufeff at\ufeffthe\ufeffend\ufeffof\ufeff2010,\ufeffthe\ufeffregulation\ufeffwas\ufeffformally\ufeffadopted\ufeffin\ufeff February\ufeff2011\ufeffand\ufeffcan\ufeffbe\ufeffapplied\ufeffas\ufeffof\ufeff1\ufeffApril\ufeff2012. elections.\ufeffThese\ufeffrights\ufeffare\ufeffalso\ufeffenshrined\ufeffin\ufeffArticles\ufeff39\ufeff \ufeff and\ufeff40\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffCharter\ufeffof\ufeffFundamental\ufeffRights\ufeffof\ufeff the\ufeffEuropean\ufeffUnion.\ufeffMore\ufeffspecifically,\ufeffthe\ufeffright\ufeffto\ufeffvote\ufeffin\ufeff European\ufeffParliament\ufeffand\ufeffmunicipal\ufeffelections\ufeffis\ufeffregulated\ufeff by\ufeffsecondary\ufefflaw. 2 2\ufeff Council\ufeffDirective\ufeff94/80/EC,\ufeffOJ\ufeff1994\ufeffL\ufeff368,\ufeffp.\ufeff34,\ufeffand\ufeffCouncil\ufeff Directive\ufeff93/109/EC,\ufeffOJ\ufeff1993\ufeffL\ufeff329,\ufeffp.\ufeff38.

Access to efficient and independent justice The 27 European Union (EU) Member States were found in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) 270 times in 2010 because court cases at national level were taking too long to be adjudicated. The right to have a case decided within a reasonable time frame is just one aspect of the right of access to justice. Access to justice is pivotal to ensuring that human rights standards are actually enforced in practice. It is also essential to ensuring the rights of the accused and suspects subject to investigation and prosecution. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in December 2009 and the momentum created by the new justice strategy, the Stockholm Programme, there have been important developments in this area. 8 Key\ufeffdevelopments\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffarea\ufeffof\ufeffaccess\ufeffto\ufeffjustice: \u2022\ufeff \ufeffan\ufeffEU\ufeffDirective\ufeffon\ufeffTranslation\ufeffand\ufeffInterpretation 3 \ufeffwas\ufeffadopted\ufeff as\ufeffa\ufefffirst\ufeffstep\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffimplementation\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffEU\ufeffRoadmap\ufefffor\ufeff strengthening\ufeffprocedural\ufeffrights\ufeffof\ufeffsuspected\ufeffor\ufeffaccused\ufeffpersons\ufeff in\ufeffcriminal\ufeffproceedings\ufeff(the\ufeff\u2018Roadmap\u2019); 4 \u2022\ufeff \ufeffseveral\ufeffEU\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufeffbegan\ufeffreform\ufeffof\ufefftheir\ufeffcourts,\ufeffincluding\ufeff measures\ufeffto\ufeffreduce\ufeffthe\ufefflength\ufeffof\ufefflegal\ufeffproceedings\ufeffand\ufeffincrease\ufeff independence; \u2022\ufeff \ufeffseveral\ufeffMember\ufeffStates\ufefftook\ufeffsteps\ufeffto\ufeffstrengthen\ufeffor\ufeffcreate\ufeff National\ufeffHuman\ufeffRights\ufeffInstitutions\ufeff(NHRIs). 8.1.

Efforts to improve access to information and access to compensation, which are essential to ensure that the rights of victims of crime are made effective in practice, can be noted among many EU Member States.

International obligations The European Union (EU) is not a \u2018self-contained regime\u2019; it operates \u2013 just as its Member States do \u2013 in an international environment and it is bound by international obligations. The year 2010 marked the debut of the modern post-Lisbon Union on the international stage, as discussions at EU level paved the way for the EU\u2019s accession to international human rights treaties. Since EU Member States are already bound by a variety of international human rights obligations, the spheres of international law and EU law stand in a communicative process of cross-fertilisation. Against this background, it is of relevance to observe the developments in 2010 with regard to EU Member States\u2019 international obligations. 10 system\ufeffof\ufeffgovernance,\ufeffefficient\ufeffprotection\ufeffof\ufefffundamental\ufeff rights\ufeffcan\ufeffonly\ufeffbe\ufeffachieved\ufeffthrough\ufeffconsistent\ufeffand\ufeffregular\ufeff cooperation\ufeffat\ufeffthe\ufefflocal,\ufeffnational\ufeffand\ufeffinternational\ufefflevel.\ufeff Another\ufeffaspect\ufeffof\ufeffthis\ufeffis\ufeffthe\ufeffneed\ufefffor\ufeff\u2018multi-agency\ufeffpartner- ships\u2019,\ufeffwhich\ufeffinteract\ufeffwith\ufeffjoined-up\ufeffgovernance\ufeffstructures.\ufeff 2010\ufeffmarked\ufeffa\ufeffyear\ufeffof\ufeffincreased\ufeffEU\ufeffcooperation\ufeffwith\ufeff international\ufefforganisations\ufeffwith\ufeffthe\ufeffnegotiations\ufeffrelating\ufeff to\ufeffthe\ufeffEU\u2019s\ufeffaccession\ufeffto\ufeffthe\ufeffEuropean\ufeffConvention\ufeffon\ufeffHuman\ufeff Rights\ufeff(ECHR)\ufeffand\ufeffthe\ufeffUnited\ufeffNations\ufeff(UN)\ufeffConvention\ufeffon\ufeff the\ufeffRights\ufeffof\ufeffPersons\ufeffwith\ufeffDisabilities\ufeff(CRPD),\ufeffwhich\ufeffwill\ufeffbe\ufeff discussed\ufeffin\ufeffmore\ufeffdetail\ufeffbelow.\ufeffHowever,\ufeffit\ufeffis\ufeffnot\ufeffonly\ufeffwhen\ufeff the\ufeffEU\ufeffenters\ufeffdirectly\ufeffinto\ufeffinternational\ufeffobligations\ufeffthat\ufeffthe\ufeff relevance\ufeffof\ufeffinternational\ufeffstandards\ufeffbecomes\ufeffapparent\ufefffor\ufeff Agency project on \u2018joined-up governance\u2019 A\ufefflarge\ufeffgap\ufeffremains\ufeffbetween\ufeffthe\ufeffrights\ufeffenshrined\ufeffin\ufeffinternational\ufeffhuman\ufeffrights\ufeffinstruments\ufeffand\ufeffthe\ufeffpractical\ufeffrealisa- tion\ufeffof\ufeffthese\ufeffrights\ufeffon\ufeffthe\ufeffground.\ufeffA\ufeffFRA\ufeffproject\ufeffhas\ufeffset\ufeffup\ufeffa\ufeffnetwork\ufeffof\ufefflocal,\ufeffregional,\ufeffnational\ufeffand\ufeffsupranational\ufeff actors,\ufeffincluding\ufeffthe\ufeffCongress\ufeffof\ufefflocal\ufeffand\ufeffregional\ufeffauthorities\ufeffof\ufeffthe\ufeffCouncil\ufeffof\ufeffEurope.\ufeffThe\ufeffproject\ufeffwill\ufeffmap\ufeffexisting\ufeff practices\ufeffstarting\ufeffwith\ufeffa\ufefffew\ufeffpilot\ufeffcountries.\ufeffOn\ufeffthe\ufeffbasis\ufeffof\ufeffpromising\ufeffpractices,\ufeffit\ufeffwill\ufeffdevelop\ufeffa\ufefftoolbox\ufeffof\ufeffjoined-up\ufeff governance\ufeffmethods\ufefffor\ufeffbetter\ufeffimplementation\ufeffof\ufefffundamental\ufeffrights.\ufeffIn\ufeff2010,\ufeffthe\ufeffAgency\ufeffcoordinated\ufeffa\ufeffpreliminary\ufeff assessment\ufeffof\ufeffidentified\ufeffpractices\ufeffin\ufeffthe\ufeffpilot\ufeffcountries\ufeffwhich\ufeffis\ufeffbeing\ufefffollowed\ufeffup\ufeffwith\ufeffsystematic\ufeffresearch\ufeffin\ufeffeach\ufeff of\ufeffthe\ufeffMember\ufeffStates.

        "Fundamental rights: challenges and achievements in 2010 ANNUAL REPORT d o i : 10 . 2811 / 25695 T K - A G - 11 - 001 - E N - C F u n d a m e n t a l r i g h t s : c h a ll e n g e s a n d a c h i e v e m e n t s i n 2010 2010 marked the first year the European Union (EU) operated on the basis of a legally binding bill of rights \u2013 the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. This year\u2019s annual report of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights puts the spotlight on the achievements and challenges of the EU and its Member States as they strive to inject robust life into their fundamental rights commitments. Steps forward in 2010 included, among many, the reinforcement of a fundamental rights check of EU legislative proposals and the adoption of the regulation on the Citizens\u2019 Initiative \u2013 an important new EU participatory democracy tool. Moves by several Member States to strengthen or create National Human Rights Institutions or the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) by the EU complemented this picture. Still, there is no room for complacency. The EU continues to face various issues of concern in the fundamental rights field, such as persisting and extreme poverty as well as social exclusion among Roma communities and deteriorating conditions of asylum seekers in certain Member States. In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights delivered over 600 judgments for violations of human rights against almost all 27 EU Member States. This report examines progress on EU and Member State rights obligations under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, covering the following topics: situation of Roma in the EU; asylum immigration and integration; border control and visa policy; information society and data protection; the rights of the child and protection of children; equality and non-discrimination; racism and ethnic discrimination; participation of EU citizens in the Union\u2019s democratic functioning; access to efficient and independent justice; and victims\u2019 protection.
