        "It is now over a year since I took office as the first permanent president of the European Council. Our institution brings the Union\u2019s highest executive leaders around the table: the 27 heads of state or government of the member states, the president of the Commission, and the president of the European Council. This strategic body does not exercise legislative functions. Together we establish political priorities, we set the Union\u2019s strategic course and we take responsibility in crisis situations. The European Council in 2010 covers our activities in 2010. It has been an eventful year. The stability of the eurozone, the state of our economies and the role of the European Union in the world required our utmost attention. On 1 December 2009, when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the European Council formally became a fully fledged institution. It also acquired a permanent president, elected for a term of two and a half years, renewable once. The new set-up was decided to give more coherence and continuity to the Union\u2019s work. The first year has proven that this idea was worthwhile. In our meetings, only the leaders and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy take part in the work. This allows an open and lively debate. With about thirty people around an oval table, one can see eye-to-eye (or just about). An exchange of views with the president of the European Parliament often precedes the meeting. The president of the European Central Bank is sometimes invited. Over time, we get to know each other very well. In the course of 2010, we welcomed six new colleagues, and said goodbye to former ones, after government changes in the United Kingdom, Hungary, Finland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Netherlands. These get-togethers are essential for building relationships amongst Europe\u2019s heads of state or government. Only trust between persons can establish a shared sense of direction. In 2010, we had six European Council meetings between 11 February and 16-17 December, one informal and five formal. There were also two meetings of the heads of state or government of the eurozone, which I chaired, one in the timeframe of the March European Council, the other as a separate meeting in May. I will always remember the first meeting I chaired, not in the usual Council premises but in the Solvay Library: snow outside, bold deal-making inside. The annual number of meetings may vary, with a Treaty-required minimum of four; in 2009 there were six and in 2008 seven. Because of their relatively low frequency and high political intensity, meetings attract a lot of public attention. They make the Union of 27 very visible. For the same reasons, careful preparations are necessary. This involves many people and institutions in Brussels and the 27 capitals. The role of the General Affairs Council is important in bringing together results achieved by the various ministers' meetings. The president\u2019s task is to prepare, chair and lead the meetings of the European Council, to seek consensus among the members, and to make sure that the decisions we take are subsequently put into practice. Together with the Commission president, the European Council president acts as the Union\u2019s representative, at his level, in relations with third countries. Even if the institution does not exercise legislative functions, the political authority of the European Council's conclusions and statements by heads of state or government is well recognised. Just like a \u2018summit\u2019, which is only reached at the end of a long journey, a European Council meeting may suddenly open new vistas. It is both the end of a process and the start of new beginnings. (cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:12)!

        "\" from the International Monetary Fund). Together with the courageous austerity measures taken by the Greek government itself, this stabilised the situation for Greece. Decisive dinner By the first week of May events had accelerated. It was clear that we needed to go beyond an ad hoc decision for one country and towards a systemic mechanism. The problem of one country became a problem for the eurozone as a whole, and even a threat to the global recovery. That\u2019s why the special summit of the sixteen heads of state or government of the eurozone \u2013 scheduled on 7 May to adopt the Greek package and look forward \u2013 unexpectedly became one of those decisive dinners which seem to be the secret of the Union's success. After midnight, the leaders of the sixteen eurozone countries agreed to use \u2018all means available\u2019 to safeguard the stability of the euro. These were not empty words. Within 48 hours, following the request of the heads of state or government, the European Commission made a proposal, the ministers of finance agreed upon an ad-hoc crisis mechanism: a system of conditional loans of 750 billion euro, which is now in place and will last until mid-2013. Several member states announced immediate extra budgetary measures and economic reforms. The European Central Bank took the unprecedented step of buying bonds on secondary markets to prevent disruption in the market. This joint effort showed that the Union\u2019s capacity to act is beyond doubt. In the spring crisis, as I said in a speech on 25 May, \u2018we built a lifeboat at sea\u2019. In a stormy situation, that was no mean feat. However, it was clear to all of us that we needed to draw the right lessons for the future: both to The year 2010 was dominated by the public debt crises in the eurozone. The issue was on the agenda for all our meetings. Even if only sixteen member states share the single currency (in the meantime seventeen, since Estonia joined on 1 January 2011), all 27 members are fully convinced that the stability of the eurozone is in the core interest of the Union as a whole. The decisions we have taken, notably in May, October and December, constitute the biggest reform of the Economic and Monetary Union since the euro was created. The public debt crises within the eurozone were an unexpected turn in the greater and global financial and economic roller-coaster which began in August 2007 and reached an international height with the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Although the risk of an economic depression across the whole of Europe proved to be short-lived \u2013 thanks to strong and coordinated interventions, most member states were back on the path to growth within a year \u2013, another threat came to light with the Greek government's financing problems, late in 2009. At the February 2010 meeting of the European Council we agreed on the principle of taking action if needed to safeguard the stability of the eurozone as a whole and to help Greece. In March, we agreed on the key features of that possible support. It was only in late April \u2013 in view of our allegedly lengthy decision-making process, it may be worthwhile to recall this sequence \u2013, that our Greek colleague for the first time asked for support. Then things moved quickly. On 2 May a deal was reached among finance ministers which was endorsed by the heads of state or government of the eurozone on 7 May. It provided a 110 billion euro loan safety package (80 billion from the EU and 30 billion #(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:30)(cid:4)(cid:8)$(cid:15)(cid:12)%(cid:5)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:11)(cid:27)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:29)&(cid:5) (cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:5)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)\u2019(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:4) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:11) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "( ( The legislative follow-up to these recommendations will proceed in accordance with regular procedures, involving the Commission, the Council of ministers and the European Parliament, but at a faster pace so as to have the new surveillance in place by summer 2011. It is our common duty. The third important decision flowing from the task force\u2019s work concerns our capacity to deal with a crisis. In October, the European Council decided to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole. The mechanism decided in May is temporary. In the last meeting of the year, we agreed on the text of the limited Treaty change required to achieve the goal. It will provide a firm legal anchor for the permanent mechanism. The European Council also endorsed the mechanism's general features, as agreed by the finance ministers. Moreover, in December 2010, the sixteen heads of state or government of the eurozone and the European Union institutions reaffirmed their determination to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole. In difficult times, the invisible and often underestimated forces which hold our Union together come to light, as the sovereign debt crisis confirmed once more. The members of the European Council have defended their collective decisions vigorously in their national parliaments. We acted upon the principles of responsibility and solidarity enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty, to the benefit of our citizens. The strong political bonds between the members of the Union have been confirmed. prevent such a crisis where possible and to enhance our capacity to deal with a crisis. That twin goal has been the European Council\u2019s priority in the second half of 2010. We have done what needed to be done. Already in our March meeting, the European Council established a task force on economic governance to draw the lessons of the crisis and to present proposals before the end of the year. As European Council president I was asked to chair it, working closely with the Commission and with representatives from the member states, the European Central Bank and the president of the Eurogroup. The contribution of the Commission was key. In May, as urgency was added to necessity, we stepped up the task force\u2019s work. Thus the European Council was able to be consulted on progress in June and September. It is in my view very positive that already in our 28-29 October meeting the European Council endorsed the task force's full report. This is a huge leap forward. Common duty Two sets of decisions stand out in terms of crisis prevention. Firstly, a stronger stability and growth pact: this will substantially increase fiscal responsibility. Sanctions will kick in earlier and progressively, on more grounds (taking into account public debt alongside the annual deficit), and be decided more easily, thanks to the so-called reverse majority vote (in which a proposal of the Commission is adopted unless rejected by a qualified majority of member states). Secondly, a new form of macro-economic surveillance: this will allow us to better monitor the economies of our countries, their competitiveness, the risks of housing bubbles and other vulnerabilities. We will act and correct if necessary.

Real-life commitment Each government will present its own proposals to reach its national contribution to those five overall targets. Each will also identify obstacles to growth and the means to remove them. A close involvement of regional and local authorities as well as of business and labour organisations and civil society will increase the sense of ownership and responsibility. This will help us move from paper targets to real-life commitment. The Social Summit on the day of the March and October European Council meetings proved in 2010 to be an important forum for dialogue on such matters. To further improve the resilience of our economies, drawing on the lessons from the financial crisis, the European Council gave a strong impetus to the ambitious reform of the supervision and regulation of the financial system. This involved the creation of a European Systemic Risk Board and three new European Supervisory Authorities, which took up their duties on 1 January 2011. In June 2010, we agreed that member states should introduce systems of levies and Many short-term problems arise because not enough attention is paid to long-term structural reform. Other major economies race ahead in terms of competitiveness, research and labour skills. Jobs and growth in Europe are at stake. That is why the European Council devoted its March and June meetings to preparing \u2018Europe 2020\u2019, an ambitious ten-year strategy for jobs and growth. In workplaces all over the continent, people feel both the thrill and the pressure of international competition: this is the challenge of globalisation. In cities and villages from Finland to Italy, homes for the elderly replace kindergartens: the challenge of demography. In the south of the continent, the Sahara is about to leap into Spain, in the north tundras are thawing and in the centre alpine glaciers melting: the challenge of climate change. Any economic strategy needs to deal with this triple challenge. As a most comprehensive response, the \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 strategy involves structural reforms in the member states and enhanced coordination of economic policies and macro-economic surveillance. The overall aim is to achieve durable growth and employment, while ensuring sustainable public finances. The policies to be implemented are largely in the realm of national responsibilities. Yet it is very important to have a common strategy and a consistent approach, not least to increase peer pressure and strengthen political resolve. The European Council in June adopted this European strategy. We decided to set five realistic and quantifiable headline targets for the European Union as a whole, to be achieved by 2020: (cid:13)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:29)(cid:15)(cid:12)%(cid:5)+(cid:9)(cid:27)(cid:30)(cid:5) (cid:11)(cid:12)!(cid:5)%(cid:8)(cid:9),(cid:29)(cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:26) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",

In the same meeting, we also decided that the stress tests of major European banks, ongoing at the time, should be made public in order to enhance transparency. The destinies of the world\u2019s main economies are more intertwined than ever before. A number of issues that have an impact upon the European economy will continue to require attention at a global level. These include risks to financial sustainability, high unemployment, volatile commodity prices and macroeconomic imbalances. To address these challenges, the European Council carefully prepared the EU position for the G-20 summits of Toronto (June) and Seoul (November). Green growth Tackling climate change - an issue of major public concern - is another important element of the Union\u2019s sustainable growth strategy. In the run-up to the United Nations Conference in Canc\u00fan in December, the European Council defined an ambitious and constructive position, which contributed to its successful outcome. We also encouraged regional initiatives to tackle climate change and promote green growth. In parallel, important work remains to be done at home, in creating green jobs and green growth.

By involving all players at the highest level, the European Council can encourage the necessary synergies between national diplomacy and our common external service, thus gradually building a European diplomatic culture. More important at this stage than the ritual 'speaking with one voice', it is imperative to deliver common key messages. In the September discussion, all colleagues also agreed that we have to strive for reciprocity and find mutual interests in dealings with global partners. The EU has a certain number of cards which we can only play together, for instance in granting increased market access or a more attractive visa regime. Heads of state or government have an important role to play in external relations: together defining strategic interests, deciding priorities and giving strategic guidance, both in \u02bbthe common foreign and security policy and [in] other areas of the external action of the Union\u2019, as the EU Treaty puts it. We are not starting from scratch. The European Union is a major trading power and the largest donor of development aid in the world, it plays a stabilising role in its neighbourhood and has in past years launched a number of civil and military crisis management missions.

The June European Council reached an agreement amongst the 27 for sanctions aimed at ensuring that Iran's nuclear programme remains a strictly civilian one. It is in Europe\u2019s core strategic interest to remove the concerns over the nature of this programme. The sanctions we agreed have strengthened the influence of the UN Security Council resolution. This was not easy. The result has been remarkable. Our decision convinced other major economies to follow suit, thus strengthening the incentives for Iran to come back to the negotiating table. In the September meeting, a month after the devastating floods which had struck the country, we decided to give Pakistan maximum support. With increased market access, the Union could offer \u2018more aid and more trade\u2019. In September, the European Council discussed the relationships with the Union\u2019s eastern and southern neighbours. The European Council will in the near future take up the Union's relations with the Western Balkans, a region which I visited twice in 2010; we have confirmed the Western Balkans' European perspective, for instance by giving Montenegro the status of candidate country in our December meeting. In the course of the year, I had four meetings with the Ukrainian president, including the November summit. As regards the few neighbours we have on the north-west side of the continent, Iceland has knocked at our door, and the June European Council took the important decision to open accession negotiations. With the new political and diplomatic means provided by the Lisbon Treaty, the European Council has shown in 2010 its readiness to act in the field of foreign relations. The bilateral summits between the Union and key partners have benefitted from the European Council\u2019s stronger involvement. Thanks to better preparation at this level, and to an agreement between the president of the Commission and myself on how best to represent the Union in various international meetings, the Commission president and I can truly speak (and listen) on behalf of the 27. Mutual benefits It is only the beginning of a process, yet the bilateral summits in the autumn started to show a difference. On 6 October we established a strategic partnership with South Korea, shortly after an important trade deal was concluded with the country. At the EU-US summit of 20 November, we reconfirmed with president Obama the significance of the transatlantic relationship and opened new avenues for cooperation on growth, jobs and security. A breakthrough, in the meeting with president Medvedev on 7 December, was the agreement with Russia on its WTO accession; this will also help our neighbour with its modernisation plans, which are in the EU's strategic interest. In the summit with Ukraine, we were able to welcome a step toward visa liberalisation and progress towards an association agreement. The summit with India on 10 December showed good prospects for an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement. Even a meeting with allegedly fewer achievements, the EU-China summit in early October, proved interesting because of our resolve to ensure reciprocity and mutual benefits. I also took part in the NATO summit of 19-20 November in Lisbon, where the importance of EU-NATO relations was underlined, and in the OSCE summit of early December in Astana.

        "(cid:19)(cid:31) The main elements of relations between our institution and the others are determined by the Treaty. The fact, for instance, that the president of the Commission is a member of the European Council creates a vital link between our two institutions, between the impetus from the capitals and the ideas and expertise from within the Brussels institutions. The Treaty also provides that the president of the European Parliament may be invited to be heard by the European Council and that the president of the European Council shall present a report to the Parliament after each meeting of the European Council. This resulted in a number of lively debates in the course of 2010. For their part, depending on national practices, individual members of the European Council also report back to their parliaments. All this The Lisbon Treaty has provided the European Union with a renewed institutional setting. The Commission continues to plays its central role as initiator of legislative proposals and guardian of the Treaties. The Parliament has become the Council's equal partner in the legislative process, playing its due role as the citizens' representative. The European Council, which previously gave its strategic guidelines from the sidelines of the formal institutional framework, has had to define its new place under the Lisbon sun. The challenge on 1 December 2009 was to translate provisions which for two years had only existed on paper into a living reality. That takes time. Embodying new functions, developing new habits, filling in some grey areas requires careful attention. No treaty text, however detailed, can define all paths in advance. /(cid:9)(cid:8)0(cid:15)(cid:12)% (cid:29)(cid:9)%(cid:4)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:8) First semester of 2010, Spain chairs the Council of ministers of the EU (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",

In a spirit of cooperation, respect and a sense of shared responsibility between the institutions and between the member states and the institutions, the Lisbon Treaty can be what it is meant to be: an instrument to strengthen the European Union's capacity to safeguard the security and prosperity of our citizens. The momentous decisions we have been able to take in 2010 regarding the monetary union show that this is possible. Nevertheless, it has been said in certain Brussels circles that the new role of the European Council has increased the influence of national governments at the expense of the EU institutions, thereby allegedly weakening the effectiveness and the democratic legitimacy of provides for the vital democratic legitimacy of our actions. Our gathering is like a weaving of institutional threads, tying national and European politics together into a common fabric. Good personal relations between the main actors are always essential for success. That is why, from the first day of my mandate, I endeavoured to establish informal and structural contacts with the Commission and its president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, with High Representative Catherine Ashton and with the European Parliament and its president Jerzy Buzek.

        "(cid:19)\" the Union's decisions. This is strange, for a number of reasons. The European Council includes 27 democratically legitimate heads of state or government. It is now an integrated part of the formal framework, with all its checks and balances. The so-called Community method is and will be the central way of adopting European policy and legislation. Yet this method, in all its variations, can only apply in areas where the Union has the competence to act and cannot be applied in fields of national competence. However, European coordination is sometimes indispensable in those areas. The economic and financial crisis has shown this clearly. G\u00e9nie europ\u00e9en That is why often the choice is not between the Community method and the intergovernmental method, but between a coordinated European position and nothing at all. The European Council, as the body bringing together the strengths of the member states and the qualities of our common institutions, is well placed to contribute to this coordinated European position, working closely with all the Union\u2019s institutions and bearing in mind that the member states are not outside of it but form its constituent parts. In the European Union, we are often caught between 'the one' and 'the many', between 'the whole' and 'the parts'. This tension is part of our identity. The g\u00e9nie europ\u00e9en is to invent ever new ways to deal with this tension. That's what politics is about. Speaking at the College of Europe in Bruges last November, chancellor Angela Merkel characterised this way of working together as the 'Union method'. In the true spirit of the Lisbon Treaty, all the Union's energies and competences must be mobilised. It is the only way to deal with the challenges which we face, in 2011 and beyond.

Over the last two years, we have faced the world\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1930s. This crisis has reversed much of the progress achieved since 2000. We are now facing excessive levels of debt, sluggish structural growth, and high unemployment. The economic situation is improving, but the recovery is still fragile. 2. Restoring macroeconomic stability and returning public finances on a sustainable path are prerequisites for growth and jobs. As agreed in December 2009, the exit from the exceptional support measures adopted to combat the crisis, once recovery is fully secured, will be important in that respect. 3. Structural reforms are essential for a strong and sustainable recovery and for preserving the sustainability of our social models. Jobs and social welfare are at stake. If we do not act, Europe will lose ground. The European Council\u2019s responsibility is to show the way ahead. 4. The EU needs a new strategy, based on an enhanced coordination of economic policies, in order to deliver more growth and jobs. Following the Commission\u2019s communication \u201cEurope 2020: a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u201d and the discussions held in the Council, the European Council agreed on the following elements of this new strategy, which will be formally adopted in June. 5. Our efforts need to be better focused in order to boost Europe\u2019s competitiveness, productivity, growth potential and economic convergence: a) The new strategy will focus on the key areas where action is needed: knowledge and innovation, a more sustainable economy, high employment and social inclusion. b) The European Council agreed on the following headline targets, which constitute shared objectives guiding the action of the Member States and of the Union: \u2212 aiming to bring to 75% the employment rate for women and men aged 20-64, including through the greater participation of youth, older workers and low skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants; (cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:24)5#(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:5)(cid:13)5(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:13)61(cid:5) \u2014 (cid:5)(cid:17) 7(cid:17)\"(cid:5)4(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:13)8(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18) (cid:13)5(cid:22)(cid:13)1(cid:23)-65(cid:22)- The European Council discussed the European Union\u2019s new strategy for jobs and growth. It agreed on its main elements, including the key targets which will guide its implementation and arrangements for its improved monitoring. Heads of State or government also held an exchange of views on competitiveness, a critical aspect of Europe\u2019s growth prospects, and discussed the state of preparation for the next G20 Summit. On climate change, the European Council agreed that it is now necessary to bring a new dynamic to the negotiation and mapped out the next steps.

        "(cid:17)\" d) Coordination at the level of the eurozone will be strengthened in order to address the challenges the euro area is facing. The Commission will present by June 2010 proposals in that respect, making use of the new instruments for economic coordination offered by Article 136 of the Treaty (TFEU). e) The EU needs to focus on the pressing challenges of competitiveness and balance of payments developments. The European Council will revert to this issue in June 2010. f) The timing of the reporting and assessment of the National Reform Programmes and Stability and Convergence Programmes should be better aligned, in order to enhance the overall consistency of policy advice to Member States. These instruments will however be kept clearly separate. The integrity of the Stability and Growth Pact will be fully preserved, as will the specific responsibility of the ECOFIN Council in overseeing its implementation. g) A close dialogue between Member States and the Commission will help increase the quality of surveillance and promote the exchange of best practices. This could include bringing together experts from the Commission and the Member States to review the situation. h) Ensuring the quality, reliability and timeliness of statistical data provided by national statistical offices will be central in ensuring credible and effective monitoring. Rapid decision is required on the Commission\u2019s proposals in this field. i) Close cooperation will be maintained with the European Parliament and other EU institutions. National parliaments, social partners, regions and other stakeholders will be involved, so as to increase ownership of the strategy. 7. The European Council asks the President of the European Council to establish, in cooperation with the Commission, a task force with representatives of the Member States, the rotating presidency and the ECB, to present to the Council, before the end of this year, the measures needed to reach the objective of an improved crisis resolution framework and better budgetary discipline, exploring all options to reinforce the legal framework. 8. Rapid progress is required on the strengthening of financial regulation and supervision both within the EU and in international fora such as the G20, while ensuring a level- playing field at the global level. Progress is particularly needed on issues such as capital requirements; systemic institutions; financing instruments for crisis management; increasing transparency on derivative markets and considering specific measures in relation to sovereign credit default swaps; and implementation of internationally agreed principles for bonuses in the financial services sector. The Commission will shortly present a report on possible innovative sources of financing such as a global levy on financial transactions. d) The new strategy will address the main bottlenecks constraining growth at national and at EU level, including those related to the working of the internal market and infrastructure. e) The Member States will draw up National Reform Programmes setting out in detail the actions they will undertake to implement the new strategy, with a particular emphasis on efforts to meet the national targets as well as on measures to lift the bottlenecks that constrain growth at the national level. f) The Commission will further develop and submit to the Council the actions it proposesto take at the EU level, notably through the flagship initiatives. g) All common policies, including the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy, will need to support the strategy. A sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the new strategy, considering the growth and employment potential of rural areas while ensuring fair competition. The European Council stresses the importance of promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion as well as developing infrastructure in order to contribute to the success of the new strategy. h) The strategy will include a strong external dimension, to ensure that EU instruments and policies are deployed to promote our interests and positions on the global scene through participation in open and fair markets worldwide. 6. Efficient monitoring mechanisms are key for the successful implementation of the strategy: a) Building on the monitoring by the Commission and the work done in the Council, the European Council will, once a year, make an overall assessment of progress achieved both at EU and at national level in implementing the strategy. The development of productivity is an essential indicator of progress. Macroeconomic, structural and competitiveness developments will be considered simultaneously, together with the assessment of overall financial stability, based on input from the European Systemic Risk Board. b) The European Council will regularly hold debates dedicated to economic developments and the main priorities of the strategy. In October 2010, it will discuss research and development, in particular looking at how to boost Europe\u2019s innovation potential in the light of current challenges. In early 2011 it will discuss energy policy, including how it can best support the shift towards an efficient low-carbon economy and greater security of supply. c) Overall economic policy coordination will be strengthened by making better use of the instruments provided by Article 121 of the Treaty (TFEU). (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:11) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",

It supports ongoing efforts to make it more effective. Given the short time available before Cancun, this process could usefully be complemented and supported by discussions in other settings and on specific issues. d) The EU will strengthen its outreach to third countries. It will do so by addressing climate change at all regional and bilateral meetings, including at summit level, as well as other fora such as the G20. The Presidency and the Commission will engage in active consultations with other partners and rapidly report back to the Council. e) Opportunities for cooperation, including with industrialised partners, need to be exploited in areas such as green technologies and norms and verification techniques. Common interests with emerging countries on issues which could create leverage in the climate change debate should be rapidly identified. 14. There is an urgent need to reverse continuing trends of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The European Council is committed to the long term biodiversity 2050 vision and the 2020 target set out in the Council\u2019s conclusions of 15 March 2010. 15. The President of the European Council announced that he would convene a special meeting of the European Council in September 2010, in the presence of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, in order to discuss how the Union can better engage with its strategic partners on global issues. \u2014 The European Council appointed Mr V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio as Vice- President of the ECB. It also endorsed the Internal Security Strategy. \u2014 ANNEX NEW EUROPEAN STRATEGY FOR JOBS AND GROWTH NEXT STEPS a) Taking account of the EU headline targets, the Commission will rapidly present, in accordance with the Treaty, its proposals for more focused integrated guidelines, including the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines. The guidelines will be discussed by the Council so that, after the consultation of the European Parliament 9. This requires that the EU make rapid progress on all these issues internally. In particular, work on the new European supervisory framework needs to be concluded in time for the European Systemic Risk Board and the three European Supervisory Authorities to begin work in early 2011. 10. The Council and the Commission will report back on these issues to the June 2010 European Council, ahead of the Toronto Summit. II. CLIMATE CHANGE: REFOCUSING OUR EFFORTS AFTER COPENHAGEN 11. A global and comprehensive legal agreement remains the only effective way to reach the agreed objective of staying below 2\u00b0C increase in global temperatures compared to preindustrial levels. On the basis of the conclusions reached by the Council on 15 and 16 March 2010, and taking note of the Commission\u2019s communication of 9 March 2010, it is now necessary to bring a new dynamic to the international negotiation process. 12. A stepwise approach should be followed, building on the Copenhagen Accord, which should be swiftly implemented: a) As a first step, the next meetings in Bonn should set the roadmap for taking the negotiations forward. The focus should be on integrating the political guidance of the Copenhagen Accord into the various negotiating texts. b) The COP-16 in Cancun should at least provide concrete decisions anchoring the Copenhagen Accord to the UN negotiating process and addressing remaining gaps, including as regards adaptation, forestry, technology and monitoring, reporting and verification. 13. The EU is prepared to play its part in this process: a) The EU and its Member States will implement their commitment to provide EUR 2.4 billion annually over the 2010-2012 period for fast-start financing, alongside contributions by other key players and in the framework of the implementation of the Copenhagen Accord. The swift implementation of this commitment will be crucial. To that end, the EU will initiate consultations on practical ways to implement fast start funding in specific areas. The EU and its Member States will present a preliminary state of play of their commitments at the May/June 2010 UNFCCC session and submit coordinated reports on implementation in Cancun and thereafter on an annual basis. b) The EU and other developed countries have committed to jointly mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries fight climate change. Financial contributions in the longer term need to be seen in the context of meaningful and transparent actions to be taken by developing countries to mitigate climate change as well (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:24) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "(cid:17)) d) In this first year of the new strategy, the Member States will present their National Reform Programmes in the Autumn 2010, setting out in detail the actions they will undertake to implement the strategy. These should be fully supported by mobilising all relevant EU instruments, including innovative financing instruments in cooperation with the EIB Group, as incentives for reform. e) The Commission will present by October 2010 the actions required at EU level to implement the new strategy, notably through the flagship initiatives. f) The Council will better align the timing of processes with a view to enhancing the overall consistency of policy advice to Member States. and other institutions on the employment guidelines, they can be endorsed by the June 2010 European Council. b) The main bottlenecks constraining growth at EU level are being identified by the Commission and will be discussed by the Council; the same will be done by the Member States at their level, in close cooperation with the Commission. The June 2010 European Council will take stock of this work, so that it can be taken into account in the drawing up of the National Reform Programmes. c) The national targets, as set out in paragraph 5c) of these conclusions, should be submitted in time to be taken into account in the drawing up of the National Reform Programmes. (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:25) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "(cid:17)* \u2014 Second, we fully support the ECB in its action to ensure the stability of the euro area. \u2014 Third, taking into account the exceptional circumstances, the Commission will propose a European stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in Europe. It will be submitted for decision to an extraordinary ECOFIN meeting that the Spanish presidency will convene this Sunday May 9th. 3. Strengthening economic governance We have decided to strengthen the governance of the euro area. In the context of the Task Force headed by the President of the European Council, we are prepared to : \u2014 broaden and strengthen economic surveillance and policy coordination in the euro area, including by paying close attention to debt levels and competitiveness developments; \u2014 reinforce the rules and procedures for surveillance of euro area Member States, including through a strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact and more effective sanctions; \u2014 create a robust framework for crisis management, respecting the principle of Member States' own budgetary responsibility. The President of the European Council decided to accelerate the work of the Task Force. The Commission will present its proposals next week on May 12. 4. Regulation of the financial markets and the fight against speculation Finally, we agreed that the current market turmoil highlights the need to make rapid progress on financial markets regulation and supervision. Increasing transparency and supervision in derivatives markets and dealing with the role of rating agencies are among the key priorities for the EU. We also agreed on intensifying the work on crisis management and resolution in the financial sector and on a fair and substantial contribution of the financial sector to the costs of crises. The work on assessing whether more steps are necessary in view of recent speculation against sovereign debtors should be sped up. The President of the European Council therefore intends to discuss these issues at the June European Council, on the basis, where needed, of Commission proposals. 1. Implementation of the support package for Greece In February and in March, we committed to take determined and coordinated action to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole. Following the request by the Greek government on April 23 and the agreement reached by the Eurogroup on May 2, we will provide Greece with 80 billion euros in a joint package with the IMF of 110 billion euros. Greece will receive a first disbursement in the coming days, before May 19. The programme adopted by the Greek government is ambitious and realistic. It addresses the grave fiscal imbalances, will make the economy more competitive, and will create the basis for stronger and more sustainable growth and job creation. The Greek Prime Minister has reiterated the total commitment of the Greek government to the full implementation of these vital reforms. The decisions we are taking reflect the principles of responsibility and solidarity, enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty, which are at the core of the monetary union. 2. Response to the current crisis In the current crisis, we reaffirm our commitment to ensure the stability, unity and integrity of the euro area. All the institutions of the euro area (Council, Commission, ECB) as well as all euro area Member States agree to use the full range of means available to ensure the stability of the euro area. Today, we agreed on the following : \u2014 First, consolidation of public finances is a priority for all of us and we will take all measures needed to meet our fiscal targets this year and in the years ahead in line with excessive deficit procedures. Each one of us is ready, depending on the situation of his country, to take the necessary measures to accelerate consolidation and to ensure the sustainability of public finances. The situation will be reviewed by the Ecofin Council on the basis of a Commission assessment by the end of June at the latest. We have asked the Commission and the Council to strictly enforce the recommendations addressed to Member States under the Stability and Growth Pact. -(cid:29)(cid:11)(cid:29)(cid:4)2(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:29)(cid:5)(cid:27)&(cid:5)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:11)!(cid:30)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:5)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:11)(cid:29)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:5)%(cid:9)$(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:12)2(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:29)(cid:5) (cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:5)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:5) \u2014 (cid:5)((cid:5)4(cid:11)&(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:26) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "(cid:26)(cid:18) account. Several Member States have recently strengthened and frontloaded budgetary consolidation. All Member States are ready, if necessary, to take additional measures to accelerate fiscal consolidation. Priority should be given to growth-friendly budgetary consolidation strategies mainly focused on expenditure restraint. Increasing the growth potential should be seen as paramount to ease fiscal adjustment in the long run. 3. The European Council confirms the five EU headline targets (annex I) which will constitute shared objectives guiding the action of Member States and the Union as regards promoting employment; improving the conditions for innovation, research and development; meeting our climate change and energy objectives; improving education levels and promoting social inclusion in particular through the reduction of poverty. It agrees on the quantification of the education and social inclusion/poverty indicators, as agreed by the Council. It gives its political endorsement to the Integrated Guidelines for economic and employment policies, which will be formally adopted following the European Parliament\u2019s opinion on the latter. The guidelines will continue to be the basis for any country-specific I. A NEW EUROPEAN STRATEGY FOR JOBS AND GROWTH Finalising and implementing the Europe 2020 Strategy 1. The European Council today has finalised the European Union\u2019s new strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The strategy will help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, both internally and at the international level, by boosting competitiveness, productivity, growth potential, social cohesion and economic convergence. The new strategy responds to the challenge of reorienting policies away from crisis management towards the introduction of medium- to longer-term reforms that promote growth and employment and ensure the sustainability of public finances, inter alia through the reform of pension systems. 2. Member States are determined to ensure fiscal sustainability and achieve budgetary targets without delay. They will continue to adopt a differentiated speed in fiscal consolidation taking both fiscal and non-fiscal risks into (cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:24)5#(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:5)(cid:13)5(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:13)61(cid:5) \u2014 (cid:5)(cid:19)((cid:5)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18) (cid:13)5(cid:22)(cid:13)1(cid:23)-65(cid:22)- The EU has met the worldwide financial crisis with united resolve and has done what was necessary to safeguard the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union. In particular, in May agreement was reached on a support package for Greece as well as on a European financial stabilisation mechanism and facility, which was finalised in June. We have been laying the foundations for much stronger economic governance. We remain committed to taking all necessary action to put our economies back on the path of sustainable and job-creating growth. To that end, today: \u2212 we adopt \u201cEurope 2020\u201d, our new strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It constitutes a coherent framework for the Union to mobilise all of its instruments and policies and for the Member States to take enhanced coordinated action. It will promote the delivery of structural reforms. The emphasis must now be on implementation, and we will guide and monitor this process. We will discuss further, over the coming months, how specific policies can be mobilised to unlock the EU\u2019s growth potential, starting with innovation and energy policies; \u2212 we reaffirm our collective determination to ensure fiscal sustainability, including by accelerating plans for fiscal consolidation where warranted; \u2212 we confirm our commitment to ensuring financial stability by addressing the gaps inregulation and supervision of financial markets, both at the level of the EU and at the G20. We agree to rapidly advance on key legislative measures so that the new supervisory bodies can start work from the beginning of next year and set an ambitious position for the EU to take at the Toronto Summit; \u2212 we fully agree on the urgent need to reinforce the coordination of our economic policies. We agree on first orientations as regards the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary surveillance as well as broader macroeconomic surveillance. We look forward to the final report of the Task Force in October.

        "(cid:26)(cid:19) Enhancing economic governance 9. The crisis has revealed clear weaknesses in our economic governance, in particular as regards budgetary and broader macroeconomic surveillance. Reinforcing economic policy coordination therefore constitutes a crucial and urgent priority. 10. The European Council welcomes the progress report of the President of the Task Force on economic governance and agrees on a first set of orientations. 11. The present rules on budgetary discipline must be fully implemented. As regards their strengthening, the European Council agrees on the following orientations : a) strengthening both the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact, with sanctions attached to the consolidation path towards the medium term objective; these will be reviewed so as to have a coherent and progressive system, ensuring a level playing field across Member States. Due account will be taken of the particular situation of Member States which are members of the euro area and Member States\u2019 respective obligations under the Treaties will be fully respected; b) Giving, in budgetary surveillance, a much more prominent role to levels and evolutions of debt and overall sustainability, as originally foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact; c) from 2011 onwards, in the context of a \u201cEuropean semester\u201d, presenting to the Commission in the spring Stability and Convergence Programmes for the upcoming years, taking account of national budgetary procedures; d) ensuring that all Member States have national budgetary rules and medium term budgetary frameworks in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; their effects should be assessed by the Commission and the Council; e) ensuring the quality of statistical data, essential for a sound budgetary policy and budgetary surveillance; statistical offices should be fully independent for data provision. 12. As regards macro-economic surveillance, it agrees on the following orientations: a) developing a scoreboard to better assess competitiveness developments and imbalances and allow for an early detection of unsustainable or dangerous trends; b) developing an effective surveillance framework, reflecting the particular situation of euro area Member States. 13. The European Council invites the Task Force and the Commission to rapidly develop further and make operational these orientations. It looks forward to the final report of the Task Force, covering the full scope of its mandate, for its meeting in October 2010. recommendations that the Council may address to Member States. These recommendations shall be fully in line with relevant Treaty provisions and EU rules and shall not alter Member States\u2019 competences, for example in areas such as education. 4. Member States must now act to implement these policy priorities at their level. They should, in close dialogue with the Commission, rapidly finalise their national targets, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances, and according to their national decision- making procedures. They should also identify the main bottlenecks to growth and indicate, in their National Reform Programmes, how they intend to tackle them. Progress towards the headline targets will be regularly reviewed. 5. All common policies, including the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy, will need to support the strategy. A sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the new strategy, considering the growth and employment potential of rural areas while ensuring fair competition. The European Council stresses the importance of promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion as well as developing infrastructure in order to contribute to the success of the new strategy. Full use should be made of the strategy\u2019s external dimension, notably via the trade strategy that the Commission will present by the end of the year. Efforts should seek to address the main bottlenecks constraining growth at EU level, including those related to the working of the internal market and infrastructure, as well as the need for a common energy policy and a new ambitious industrial policy. 6. In particular, Europe\u2019s Single Market needs be taken to a new stage, through a comprehensive set of initiatives. The European Council welcomes the report presented by Mr Mario Monti on a new strategy for the Single Market and the Commission\u2019s intention to follow it up by presenting concrete proposals. The European Council will revert to this matter in December 2010. 7. Further to the presentation by the Commission of the first flagship initiative on a \u2018Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019, the European Council endorses the establishment of an ambitious action agenda based on concrete proposals and calls upon all institutions to engage in its full implementation, including the creation of a fully functioning digital single market by 2015. The Commission is invited to report on progress achieved by the end of 2011. 8. The European Council looks forward to the presentation of the other flagship initiatives before the end of the year. (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:7) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "(cid:26)(cid:17) boost competitiveness, consolidate public finances and reform its financial sector will enable it to put forward strong positions for similar international action at the forthcoming G20 Summit. The EU should lead efforts to set a global approach for introducing systems for levies and taxes on financial institutions with a view to maintaining a world-wide level playing field and will strongly defend this position with its G20 partners. The introduction of a global financial transaction tax should be explored and developed further in that context. 18. With a view to the Toronto Summit, the European Council confirms the orientations agreed by the Council and reflected in the Terms of Reference prepared for the Busan Ministerial Meeting. Given the major risks that late exit from extraordinary fiscal stimulus would entail for public accounts\u2019 sustainability, the G20 should agree on a coordinated and differentiated exit strategy to ensure sustainable public finances. All major economies need to do their part to achieve the agreed objective of a strong, sustainable and balanced growth. The G20 must reaffirm its commitment to the reform of the financial system and make rapid progress in a consistent and coordinated manner on the whole range of actions agreed upon in Pittsburgh, to strengthen the resilience and transparency of our financial system, including through better quality additional capital and new liquidity buffer. In the IMF, quotas should be reviewed as part of a wider package of IMF governance issues, covering all elements agreed in Pittsburgh and Istanbul, and be completed, as a single and comprehensive package by November 2010. III. MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS 19. The forthcoming UN High Level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals constitutes a unique opportunity to strengthen our collective endeavours and our partnerships with developing countries to eliminate global poverty, hunger and inequality. The conclusions adopted by the Council on 14 June provide the European Union with a strong position for this meeting. 20. The European Union remains determined to support the achievement of the MDGs globally by 2015. This is possible if all partners demonstrate firm political commitment, implement necessary policy changes and take concrete action. The European Union calls on the High Level Plenary Meeting to agree on concrete actions aimed at: increasing ownership by developing countries; focusing efforts; improving the impact of policies; mobilising more and predictable financing for development, including innovative Regulating financial services 14. The necessary reforms to restore the soundness and stability of the European financial system must be completed urgently. The resilience and transparency of the banking sector must be ensured. Progress in the next few months is essential. The European Council agrees that the results of ongoing stress tests by banking supervisors will be disclosed at the latest in the second half of July. The Commission\u2019s communication on \u201cRegulating Financial Services for sustainable growth\u201d of 2 June 2010 sets out a comprehensive list of initiatives to be undertaken and completed before the end of 2011. The EU must demonstrate its determination to bring about a safer, sounder, more transparent and more responsible financial system. 15. In particular, the European Council: a) calls on the Council and the European Parliament to rapidly adopt the legislative proposals on financial supervision to ensure that the European Systemic Risk Board and the three European Supervisory Authorities can begin working from the beginning of 2011; b) calls for agreement on the legislative proposal on alternative investment fund managers before the summer and for the swift examination of the Commission\u2019s proposal on the improvement of the EU\u2019s supervision of credit rating agencies; c) looks forward to proposals announced by the Commission on derivative markets and in particular appropriate measures on short selling (including \u201cnaked\u201d short selling) and credit default swaps. 16. The European Council agrees that Member States should introduce systems of levies and taxes on financial institutions to ensure fair burden-sharing and to set incentives to contain systemic risk. 1 Such levies or taxes should be part of a credible resolution framework. Further work is urgently required on their main features and issues of level playing field and cumulative impacts of various regulatory measures should be carefully assessed. The European Council invites the Council and the Commission to take this work forward and report back in October 2010. II. G 20 TORONTO SUMMIT 17.

The European Council welcomes Iceland\u2019s commitment to address these issues and expresses its confidence that Iceland will actively pursue its efforts to resolve all outstanding issues. The European Council confirms that the negotiations will be based on Iceland\u2019s own merits and that the pace will depend on Iceland\u2019s progress in meeting the requirements set out in the negotiating framework, which will address i.a. the above requirements. 26. The European Council congratulates Estonia on the convergence it has achieved, based on sound economic and financial policies, and welcomes its fulfilment of all the convergence criteria as set out in the Treaty. It welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal that Estonia adopt the euro on 1 January 2011. 27. The European Council adopts a Declaration on Iran (annex II). 28. Confirming its previous conclusions of December 2008 and June 2009, and following on its decision of December 2009 to examine transitional measures regarding the addition of 18 seats in the European Parliament until the end of the present 2009-2014 parliamentary term, the European Council adopts a decision (doc. EUCO 11/10) to pursue the necessary procedure to adopt those measures. ANNEXES I.

The European Council reaffirms its commitment to achieve development aid targets by 2015 as set out in its June 2005 conclusions. The European Council agrees to return to this annually on the basis of a report by the Council. IV. CLIMATE CHANGE 21. The European Council takes note of the Commission\u2019s communication analysing options to move beyond 20% greenhouse gas emission reductions and assessing the risk of carbon leakage. In line with the conclusions of the Council of 11 June, the Commission will undertake further analyses, including consequences for each Member State, and the Council will examine further the issues raised in the communication. As shown in the ECOFIN report, the EU and its Member States have advanced in the implementation of their fast start commitments for 2010 and will report at the Cancun conference in a coordinated manner on progress achieved. The European Council will revert to climate change in the autumn, in advance of the Cancun conference. V. OTHER ISSUES 22. The European Council expresses its appreciation for the work achieved by the Reflection Group. The Group\u2019s report on \u201cProject Europe 2030 - Challenges and Opportunities\u201d will provide useful input for the European Union\u2019s work in the future. 23. The European Council welcomes the progress achieved in implementing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and endorses the conclusions of the Council of 3/4 June. 24. The European Council welcomes the Commission opinion on Iceland\u2019s application for membership of the EU and the recommendation that accession negotiations should be opened. Having considered the application on the basis of the opinion and its December 2006 conclusions on the renewed consensus for enlargement, it notes that Iceland meets the political criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 and decides that accession negotiations should be opened. 25. The European Council invites the Council to adopt a general Negotiating Framework. It recalls that negotiations will be aimed at Iceland integrally adopting the EU acquis and ensuring its full implementation and enforcement, addressing existing obligations such as those identified (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:23) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",

The European Council, recalling its declaration of 11 December 2009 and in the light of the work undertaken by the Foreign Affairs Council thereafter, invites the Foreign Affairs Council to adopt at its next session measures implementing those contained in the UN Security Council Resolution 1929 as well as accompanying measures, with a view to supporting the resolution of all outstanding concerns regarding Iran\u2019s development of sensitive technologies in support of its nuclear and missile programmes, through negotiation. These should focus on the areas of trade, especially dual use goods and further restrictions on trade insurance; the financial sector, including freeze of additional Iranian banks and restrictions on banking and insurance; the Iranian transport sector, in particular the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL) and its subsidiaries and air cargo; key sectors of the gas and oil industry with prohibition of new investment, technical assistance and transfers of technologies, equipment and services related to these areas, in particular related to refining, liquefaction and LNG technology; and new visa bans and asset freezes especially on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). 5. The European Council confirms once again the commitment of the European Union to work for a diplomatic solution of the issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. The European Council calls on Iran to demonstrate willingness to build the confidence of the international community and to respond to the invitation for resumption of negotiations, and reaffirms the validity of the June 2008 proposals made to Iran. 6. What is needed is a serious negotiation concerning Iran's nuclear programme and other issues of mutual concern. The European Council underlines that the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is ready to resume talks in this regard. the EU is committed to taking a decision to move to a 30% reduction by 2020 compared to 1990 levels as its conditional offer with a view to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities; \u2212 improving education levels, in particular by aiming to reduce school drop-out rates to less than 10% and by increasing the share of 30-34 years old having completed tertiary or ent education to at least 40%; 2 \u2212 promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty, by aiming to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion. 3 II. DECLARATION ON IRAN 1. The European Council underlines its deepening concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and welcomes the adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 1929 introducing new restrictive measures against Iran. 2. The European Council welcomes the recent efforts by Brazil and Turkey to secure progress on the Tehran Research Reactor agreement proposed to Iran by the IAEA in October 2009. A satisfactory agreement with Iran on the TRR could serve as a confidence building measure. However, the European Council stresses that it would not address the core of Iran\u2019s nuclear issue. The European Council urges Iran to engage in negotiations on its nuclear programme. 3. The European Council reaffirms the rights and responsibilities of Iran under the NPT. The European Council deeply regrets that Iran has not taken the many opportunities which have been offered to it to remove the concerns of the international community over the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. The decision by Iran to enrich uranium to the level of 20 per cent, contrary to its international obligations under existing UNSC and IAEA Board of Governors Resolutions has further increased these 2 The European Council emphasises the competence of Member States to define and implement quantitative targets in the field of education. 3 The population is defined as the number of persons who are at risk-of-poverty and exclusion according to three indicators (at- risk-of poverty; material deprivation; jobless household), leaving Member States free to set their national targets on the basis of the most appropriate indicators, taking into account their national circumstances and priorities.

The European Union\u2019s strategic partnerships with key players in the world provide a useful instrument for pursuing European objectives and interests. This will only work if these partnerships are two-way streets based on mutual interests and benefits and on the recognition that all actors have rights as well as duties. The full participation of emerging economies in the international system should allow its benefits to be spread in a balanced manner and its responsibilities to be shared evenly. In this context, enhancing trade with strategic partners constitutes a crucial objective, contributing to economic recovery and job creation. We must take concrete steps to secure ambitious Free Trade Agreements, secure greater market access for European businesses and deepen regulatory cooperation with major trade partners. Orientations for upcoming events 5. The European Union will hold a number of important international meetings in the coming weeks. The European Council lays out initial orientations today with a view to these meetings. It will in future regularly discuss external relations in order to set strategic orientations in advance of key events, in particular with a view to defining key messages on our objectives and on the means to achieve them. This requires clear strategic guidance by the European Council on the basis of effective preparation by the High Representative and by the Council. 6. October will see summits with China and the Republic of Korea and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), followed later in the year by a summit with India. They are a good opportunity to engage with key partners in a very dynamic part of the world. Issues such as our respective roles in achieving a sustainable recovery from the economic crisis I. RELATIONS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS A changing world: a challenge for the EU 1. Europe is facing many challenges in a rapidly changing world, which all require a concerted international response. The recent economic and financial crisis has dramatically shown the extent to which the well-being, security and quality of life of Europeans depend on external developments. The emergence of new players with their own world views and interests is also an important new feature in the international environment. 2. The European Union must be an effective global actor, ready to share in the responsibility for global security and to take the lead in the definition of joint responses to common challenges. A strong economy and internal cohesion will strengthen the Union\u2019s ability to project its influence in the world. The Union can draw on its firmly- rooted belief in effective multilateralism, especially the role of the UN, universal values, an open world economy and on its unique range of instruments. It remains the largest donor to countries in need, it is the first trading power in the world, and it has developed a common security and defence policy supported by crisis management tools which should be further reinforced. It also plays a major stabilizing role in its neighbourhood. The Union has secured stability in the Western Balkans particularly through the European perspective given to that region; the European Council will return to this at a subsequent meeting. 3. In accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, and in line with the European Security Strategy, the European Union and its Member States will act more strategically so as to bring Europe\u2019s true weight to bear internationally. This requires a clear identification of its strategic interests and objectives at a given moment and focused reflection on the means to pursue them more assertively. The European Council calls for improved synergies between the European Union and national levels, consistent with the provisions of the Treaties, (cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:24)5#(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:5)(cid:13)5(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:13)61(cid:5) \u2014 (cid:5)(cid:19)\"(cid:5)-(cid:6)#(cid:2)(cid:6)49(cid:6)(cid:24)(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18) (cid:13)5(cid:22)(cid:13)1(cid:23)-65(cid:22)- The European Council discussed how to give new momentum to the Union\u2019s external relations, taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by the Lisbon Treaty. It agreed on the need for Europe to promote its interests and values more assertively and in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit. As a first step, it set general orientations with a view to a number of important events over the coming weeks and months. It also decided on a number of concrete measures to more generally enhance the effectiveness of the Union\u2019s external policy. The European Council took stock of progress achieved in the Task Force on economic governance.

        "(cid:26)\" October 2010 European Council will agree on the key political messages the European Union representatives will bring to this major summit. Based on a good understanding of our mutual interests and respective contributions, the transatlantic partnership should concentrate on maximising the potential benefits of our economic relationship, on working more closely on major international issues and on confronting global economic and security challenges together in a concerted manner. In this connection, the High Representative is invited to develop ideas on how EU/NATO cooperation in crisis management, in accordance with the United Nations Charter and with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, could be further strengthened. This should be done in a spirit of mutual reinforcement and with due respect for their decision-making autonomy, further to the recommendations on concrete measures transmitted by the EU to NATO in February 2010. c. The European Council will take stock of preparations for the Cancun conference on climate change at its October meeting and agree on the EU position. Cancun should be a stepping stone in the international climate negotiations, agreeing on concrete deliverables for all participants to create momentum and stay on track for an ambitious final agreement. d. The upcoming reflection on the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy will provide an opportunity to deepen relations with the Union\u2019s eastern neighbours through the Eastern Partnership as well as with its southern neighbours. The smooth implementation of projects launched within the Eastern Partnership constitutes an outreach of EU values and promotes the legal, economic and social approximation of the countries concerned to the EU. The second summit of the Union for the Mediterranean will provide a timely opportunity to strengthen Euro- Mediterranean cooperation and support the resumption of direct negotiations between the parties in the Middle East Peace Process. e. EU/Africa relations have taken on a new dynamic in recent years. The EU/South Africa Summit on 28 September 2010 and the EU/Africa Summit on 29/30 November 2010 should serve to further deepen elations. The EU, in partnership with African countries, will continue to pursue the objectives of economic development, good governance, transparency and accountability in the context of the joint EU/Africa Strategy. f. The 20-22 September UN High Level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals will be held in New York. The European Union is firmly committed to supporting the achievement of the MDG globally by 2015, together with partners in the international community. and in seeking global solutions to universal challenges will be on the agenda. Concrete steps should be taken in priority areas of cooperation between Europe and Asia, such as cooperation on climate change, including on the promotion of effective and verifiable reductions in emissions, as well as on renewables and energy efficiency; pressing security issues, such as proliferation, terrorism, cybersecurity and piracy; cooperation on regional issues such as Iran and North Korea as well as on global issues such as migration, energy and access to raw materials; working together on development policies and the promotion of good governance, labour standards and human rights and developing people-to-people relations. In view of the EU/China summit in particular, the European Union should actively pursue its strategic interests, including as regards the promotion of bilateral trade, market access for goods and services and investment conditions; the protection of intellectual property rights and the opening up of public procurement markets; stronger discipline in the field of export subsidies; and the dialogue on exchange rate policies. 7. Over the coming months there will be a number of other important external relations issues which will have to be addressed by the European Council. a. The G20 Summit in Seoul will allow a review of the global economic recovery and the commitments made by G20 members. In particular, it will allow the Union to stress the importance of maintaining strong momentum in the area of financial reform; in this respect, the recent agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the financial supervision package and the completion of the reform of the regulatory framework by the end of 2011 strengthen the EU\u2019s hand. It should also serve to send a clear signal on the need to conclude the WTO DDA negotiations and implement the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth. The European Council will discuss the detailed preparation of Seoul at its October 2010 meeting and determine the Union\u2019s position. The G8 and the G20 will remain important fora for the definition of global responses to many of the challenges facing us, to which the EU must actively contribute through coordinated positions. The European Council therefore welcomes the ambition of the incoming French chairmanship in 2011 to fully use the G20 and G8 to that end. b. The transatlantic relationship is based on common values and constitutes a core element of the international system. The present circumstances call for fresh impetus to be given to this relationship and for renewed reflection on ways of creating a true partnership based on our respective strengths and specificities. The November 2010 summit with President Obama will constitute a real opportunity in this respect and will require careful preparation.

ANNEXES I. INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS TO IMPROVE THE EUROPEAN UNION\u2019S EXTERNAL POLICY a) Looking at concrete measures to more generally improve the functioning of the European Union\u2019s external policy, the European Council calls for a more integrated approach, ensuring that all relevant EU and national instruments and policies are fully and coherently mobilised, consistent with the provisions of the Treaties, in support of the European Union\u2019s strategic interests. The importance of issues like climate change, energy policy, trade, development or Justice and Home Affairs issues, including migration and visa policy in dealings with partners and at a multilateral level must be fully taken into account in preparations for summits and international events. In this regard the European Union should further enhance the coherence and complementarity between its internal and external policies. The practice of holding orientation debates well before summits should be further developed, with a particular emphasis on setting priorities and concrete tasking. b) Synergies need to be developed between the European Union\u2019s external relations and Member States bilateral relations with third countries, so that, where appropriate, what is done at the level of the European Union complements and reinforces what is done at the level of the Member States and vice versa. There should be more active and regular sharing of information and consultation on developments at the respective levels, on the basis of a running calendar of EU and Member States\u2019 summits with major strategic partners. c) Close and regular coordination between all the different institutional actors involved in the definition and implementation of the European Union\u2019s external relations is necessary to ensure that EU representatives can defend coherent positions on the whole range of the strategic interests and objectives of the Union. d) Much progress has been achieved in the preparation, at the level of the European Union, for multilateral summits, notably through the practical arrangements reached g. The upcoming summits with Ukraine in November and Russia in December should be used to deepen cooperation on areas of mutual benefit, so as to bring more stability and predictability to those two important relationships, as well as to promote human rights. In particular, the summit with Ukraine should bring progress to the negotiations on the Association Agreement, including the deep and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, and highlight the role of the EU in the economic and democratic reforms of this important neighbour. The summit with Russia will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation with Russia and to discuss in particular its modernization agenda. Cooperation should be enhanced on economic issues such as energy, investment and innovation, on security issues, including frozen conflicts, the combat against terrorism and organized crime, and on environmental issues, including climate change. The October European Council will come back to the key messages of the European Union in these summits so as to ensure a fruitful outcome. h. Building on the successful summit held this year with its Latin American and Caribbean partners, the EU is committed to continuing to work closely together with the countries of the region in response to the global challenges facing us. 8. Pakistan\u2019s development and stability is of strategic importance to the European Union. In light of the devastating floods, the European Union and its Member States have responded with an increase in bilateral and multilateral humanitarian aid. The European Council adopted a declaration on Pakistan (Annex II). 9. The European Union will remain actively engaged and involved, including through the Quartet, to support and ensure the success of the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The European Council adopted a declaration on the Middle East Peace Process (Annex III). II. TASK FORCE ON ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE 10. On the basis of an interim report of the President of the Task Force on economic governance, the European Council welcomes the important progress made, notably on the European semester, on the development of a new macro-surveillance framework to monitor and correct unsustainable competitiveness divergences and imbalances in a timely manner and on the strengthening of national fiscal frameworks. 11. The European Council underlines the need to maintain momentum on the reform of European economic (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:24) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "(cid:26)) 2. The European Council recalls the recent efforts of the EU (Member States and the Commission) in response to the crisis, notably the provision of significant humanitarian aid. It recognises the importance of further support to Pakistan to bring immediate relief and longer term assistance for recovery and reconstruction. 3. To this end, the European Council resolves to mandate Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short, medium and longer term measures which will help underpin Pakistan\u2019s recovery and future development. These should comprise significant additional humanitarian and development assistance as well as ambitious trade measures essential for economic recovery and growth. In this regard, the European Council underlines its firm commitment to grant exclusively to Pakistan increased market access to the EU through the immediate and time limited reduction of duties on key imports from Pakistan in conformity with WTO rules, to be implemented as soon as possible, and to commit to Pakistan\u2019s eligibility for GSP+ for 2014, provided it meets the necessary criteria. The Commission is invited to explore options with WTO partners and to present its finalised proposal in October taking account of industrial sensitivities in the EU. III. DECLARATION ON THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS The European Union strongly welcomes the launch of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, announced in Washington on 2nd September 2010, and commends the Israelis, the Palestinians and the United States as well as the Quartet and Arab partners for their efforts. The decision by the parties to engage in substantive talks represents a major step on the road towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the region. Recalling the Council conclusions of December 2009 on the Middle East Peace Process, the European Union stresses that these negotiations on all final status issues should lead to a two-state solution with the State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security. In this context, the European Union deems it indispensable that both parties observe calm and restraint and refrain from actions that could affect negatively the progress of the negotiations. It calls on both parties to uphold previous commitments and to strive to create an environment conducive to a successful outcome. The European Union recalls that settlements are illegal under international law and calls for an extension of the moratorium decided by Israel. It continues to call for a complete stop to all violence, in particular rocket fire and terrorist attacks. between the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission on the EU representation in the G8 and G20 structures. It invites them to continue to work towards improving the way in which the European Union projects its views in such fora. e) The European Union needs a clear picture of the particular issues arising from relations with the individual partner States. It needs to develop medium-term planning that sets out objectives to be reached over time, with each summit concentrating on two or three core issues. The European Council therefore asks the High Representative, in coordination with the Commission and with the Foreign Affairs Council, to evaluate the prospects of relations with all strategic partners, and set out in particular our interests and possible leverage to achieve them. The High Representative is invited to present a first progress report on this work to the December 2010 European Council. In this context, there should be a reflection on the frequency, format and output of those summits, which need to be better targeted towards reaching EU objectives. The European Council invites its President, in cooperation with the President of the Commission and the High Representative, to take any necessary initiatives with a view to improving the process. f) The European External Action Service will be a crucial tool in support of the efforts towards enhancing the European Union\u2019s external policy. At service level, it will, under the authority of the High Representative, provide support to the European Council, the Council and the Commission concerning the strategic overview and coordination necessary to ensure the coherence of the European Union\u2019s external action as a whole. II. DECLARATION ON PAKISTAN 1. The European Council is shocked at the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan which continue to destroy livelihoods and communities throughout the country. The scale of the disaster is unprecedented in Pakistan\u2019s history. The cost in humanitarian needs and to its already fragile economy is immense. The severity of this crisis demands an immediate and substantial response, taking also into account the strategic importance of Pakistan\u2019s development, security and stability in the region. Following the second EU-Pakistan Summit held last June, the European Council reiterates its intention to strengthen cooperation on political issues. A stable, democratic and prosperous Pakistan is key to addressing global issues such as counter-terrorism, non- proliferation or counter-narcotics. Good governance will also be key to ensure swift reconstruction of the country.

It welcomes the recent measures announced by the Israeli government as an important step forward. It calls for full implementation and complementary measures in order to achieve a fundamental change of policy that allows for the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. The EU has offered its assistance for achieving this objective. The European Union calls for a solution addressing Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns. The European Union recalls that peace in the Middle East should be comprehensive and reiterates the importance of negotiations on the Israeli-Syria and Israeli-Lebanon tracks. The European Union will spare no effort, along with its partners in the Quartet as well as Arab partners, to support the US-led efforts for successful negotiations that lead to a framework agreement within one year, which is in the interest of Israelis and Palestinians, the peoples of the region and the international community. The European Union is the first donor to the Palestinians and a crucial political and economic partner of both parties as well as their neighbours. In this regard, it stresses that the European Union will remain actively engaged and involved, including through the Quartet, to support and ensure the success of the negotiations and invites the High Representative to continue to fully associate the European Union to the ongoing efforts. The European Union stresses the need for the Quartet to continue to play an essential role in the peace process. It also stresses the crucial importance of the continuation of the Palestinian State building process which the European Union will continue to actively support, including the implementation of the Fayyad Plan.

The European Council will revert to this matter at its December meeting with a view to taking the final decision both on the outline of a crisis mechanism and on a limited treaty amendment so that any change can be ratified at the latest by mid-2013. The President of the European Council intends to subsequently examine in consultation with the Member States the issue of the right of euro area members to participate in decision making in EMU-related procedures in the case of a permanent threat to the stability of the euro area as a whole. 3. Heads of State or Government stressed that, at the same time as fiscal discipline is reinforced in the European Union, it is essential that the European Union budget and the forthcoming Multi-annual Financial Framework reflect the consolidation efforts being made by Member States to bring deficit and debt onto a more sustainable path. Respecting the role of the different institutions and the need to meet Europe\u2019s objectives, the European Council will discuss at its next meeting how to ensure that spending at the European level can make an appropriate contribution to this work. II. SEOUL G20 SUMMIT 4. The world economy is recovering from the crisis. However, there remain a number of issues that require sustained attention at the global level, including risks to financial sustainability, incomplete financial sector repair, high unemployment, the volatility of global commodity prices, and re-emerging global macroeconomic imbalances. The European Council confirmed the orientations agreed by the Council and discussed the priorities which the representatives of the EU and the EU Member States which I. TASK FORCE ON ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE 1. The European Council endorses the report of the Task Force on economic governance. Its implementation will allow us to increase fiscal discipline, broaden economic surveillance, deepen coordination, and set up a robust framework for crisis management and stronger institutions. The European Council calls for a \u201cfast track\u201d approach to be followed on the adoption of secondary legislation needed for the implementation of many of the recommendations. The objective is for the Council and the European Parliament to reach agreement by summer 2011 on the Commission\u2019s legislative proposals, noting that the Task Force report does not cover all issues addressed in these proposals and vice- versa. This will ensure the effective implementation of the new surveillance arrangements as soon as possible. The result will be a substantial strengthening of the economic pillar of EMU, enhancing confidence and thus contributing to sustainable growth, employment and competitiveness. The European Council invites the Council to speed up work on how the impact of pension reform is accounted for in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and report back to the European Council in December. Acknowledging the importance of systemic pension reforms, a level playing field within the SGP should be ensured. 2. Further to the report of the Task Force, and in order to ensure balanced and sustainable growth, Heads of State or Government agree on the need for Member States to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and invite the President of the European Council to undertake consultations with the members of the European Council on a limited treaty change required to that effect, not modifying article 125 TFEU (\u201cno bail-out\u201d clause). The European Council welcomes the intention of the Commission to undertake, in close consultation with the (cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:24)5#(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:5)(cid:13)5(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:13)61(cid:5) \u2014 (cid:5)(cid:17))7(cid:17)*(cid:5)5(cid:13)(cid:2)59(cid:6)(cid:24)(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18) (cid:13)5(cid:22)(cid:13)1(cid:23)-65(cid:22)- In order to address the challenges revealed by the recent financial crisis, a fundamental shift in European economic governance is required. To that end, the European Council endorsed the report of the Task Force on economic governance. Its implementation will constitute a major step forward in strengthening the economic pillar of EMU: it will increase fiscal discipline, broaden economic surveillance and deepen coordination. The report also sets out the guiding principles for a robust framework for crisis management and stronger institutions. The European Council agreed on the way forward concerning the follow-up to the Task Force. Further to its discussions of 16 September 2010, the European Council also exchanged views in preparation for the Seoul G20 Summit and the Canc\u00fan Conference on climate change as well as the summits with the United States, Russia, Ukraine, India and Africa. (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:6) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",
        "(cid:31)(cid:19) met. The European Union will submit a comprehensive and transparent report on the implementation of its commitment on fast-start financing in Canc\u00fan and yearly thereafter and will underline the importance of further increasing transparency of climate change financing. The European Union will reassess the situation after the Canc\u00fan Conference, including the examination of options to move beyond 20% greenhouse gas emission reductions to be prepared to react to the ongoing international climate negotiations; the Council is invited to report back on this issue by spring 2011. In parallel with seeking an international agreement, the EU will also develop a more diversified approach to engaging with key partners in areas of mutual interest that help them reduce their emissions. In this context, the EU encourages regional initiatives to tackle climate change and promote green growth such as the recent Mediterranean Initiative on Climate Change. IV. SUMMITS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES 8. In line with its conclusions of September 2010, the European Council discussed the key political messages which the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission will promote at the forthcoming summits with the United States, Russia, Ukraine, India and Africa. \u2014 In the margins of the European Council a Social Summit was held, focusing on economic governance following the final report of the Task Force, in the light of the conclusions adopted by the Council (EPSCO) on 21 October 2010. \u2014 are member of the G20 will promote at the Seoul summit. The summit must send an ambitious signal as regards the concrete and timely implementation of measures agreed in the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth, notably concerning fiscal consolidation plans, financial regulatory reform, social cohesion, job creation and the need for further structural reforms. The issue of the rebalancing of world growth also requires particular attention. The European Union looks forward to the confirmation by the G20 Summit of the Basel agreement, which is an important step in strengthening global financial stability. The European Union emphasises the need to continue keeping markets open, to inject momentum into the Doha negotiations and to adopt a growthoriented development agenda. It stresses the need to avoid all forms of protectionism and to avoid engaging in exchange-rate moves aimed at gaining short-term competitive advantages. 5. The agreement reached at the G20 Ministerial Meeting of 23 October 2010 on the reform of the International Monetary Fund will help deliver a more effective, credible and legitimate IMF and enable the IMF to play its role in supporting the operation of the international monetary and financial system. Quota as well as wider governance reforms should be delivered together as a single, comprehensive package and within the same time frame. 6. Further work is necessary on levies and taxes on financial institutions, at both the international and internal levels. In line with the Council\u2019s report, there should be further coordination between the different levy schemes in place in order to avoid double-charging. The Council is invited to report back to the European Council in December 2010. The different options regarding the taxation of the financial sector should also be examined, as well as good practices aimed at impeding tax havens and tax evasion. III. CANC\u00daN CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE 7. Making progress in tackling climate change is becoming ever more urgent. It is therefore important that the Canc\u00fan Conference deliver a significant intermediate step, building on the Kyoto Protocol and paving the way towards a global and comprehensive legally binding framework, integrating the political guidance given in the Copenhagen Accord. It is crucial that the European Union and its Member States continue to play a constructive role and that they deliver a single message. The European Council endorses the conclusions of the Council of 14 October 2010 on the preparation of the Canc\u00fan Conference and confirms the willingness of the European Union to consider a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol provided the conditions set out in these conclusions are (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:7) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:11) ",

It welcomed the Council's report on the treatment of systemic pension reform under the Stability and Growth Pact and called for the report to be reflected in the specifications on the implementation of the reformed SGP. 6. Recalling its conclusions of October 2010, the European Council looked forward to the Commission's intention to make proposals for the new multiannual financial framework by June 2011 and invited the institutions to cooperate in order to facilitate its timely adoption. 7. The new Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth will continue to guide the Union and the Member States in responding to the crisis and promoting the delivery of structural reforms. The European Council welcomed the progress achieved since the launch of the strategy, as shown in the report presented by the Presidency. 8. The European Council welcomed the Statement by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area and the EU institutions (annex III). II. OTHER ISSUES 9. The European Council welcomed the first progress report presented by the High Representative on the European Union's relations with its strategic partners. On this basis, the European Council invited the High Representative, in close cooperation with the Commission and the Foreign Affairs Council, to take this work forward in line with its conclusions of September 2010, setting out common European interests and identifying all possible leverages to achieve them. The European Council will take stock of progress once a year and, where necessary, set orientations. The launch of the EEAS and its coordinating role provide a valuable opportunity to step up this work. 10. The European Council endorsed the Council's conclusions of 14 December 2010 on enlargement and agreed to give Montenegro the status of candidate country. I. ECONOMIC POLICY 1. The European Council welcomed the report presented by its President following up on its conclusions of 28 and 29 October 2010. It agreed that the Treaty should be amended in order for a permanent mechanism to be established by the Member States of the euro area to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as whole (European Stability Mechanism). This mechanism will replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), which will remain in force until June 2013. As this mechanism is designed to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as whole, the European Council agreed that Article 122(2) TFEU will no longer be needed for such purposes. Heads of State or Government therefore agreed that it should not be used for such purposes. 2. The European Council agreed on the text of the draft decision amending the TFEU set out in annex I. It decided to immediately launch the simplified revision procedure provided for in Article 48(6) TEU. The consultation of the institutions concerned should be concluded on time to allow the formal adoption of the decision in March 2011, completion of national approval procedures by the end of 2012, and entry into force on 1 January 2013. 3. The European Council also called for Finance Ministers of the euro area and the Commission to finalise work on the intergovernmental arrangement setting up the future mechanism by March 2011, integrating the general features set out in the Eurogroup statement of 28 November 2010, which the European Council endorsed (annex II). The mechanism will be activated by mutual agreement of the euro area Member States in case of risk to the stability of the euro area as a whole. 4. Member States whose currency is not the euro will, if they so wish, be involved in this work. They may decide to participate in operations conducted by the mechanism on an ad hoc basis. 5. The European Council called for the acceleration of the work on the six legislative proposals on economic (cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:24)5#(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:5)(cid:13)5(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:13)61(cid:5) \u2014 (cid:5)(cid:19)\"7(cid:19)((cid:5):(cid:6)(cid:13)(cid:6)49(cid:6)(cid:24)(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18) (cid:13)5(cid:22)(cid:13)1(cid:23)-65(cid:22)- Throughout the crisis, we have taken decisive action to preserve financial stability and promote the return to a sustainable growth. We will continue to do so and the EU and the euro area will emerge stronger from the crisis. Growth prospects are strengthening and the fundamentals of the European economy are sound. The temporary stability tools put in place earlier this year have proved their utility, but the crisis has demonstrated that there can be no complacency. This is why we agreed today on the text of a limited amendment to the Treaty on the establishment of a future permanent mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. This amendment should enter into force on 1 January 2013. We also reiterated our commitment to reach agreement on the legislative proposals on economic governance by end June 2011 with the aim of strengthening the economic pillar of the Economic and Monetary Union and to continue to implement the Europe 2020 strategy.

        "(cid:31)(cid:26) (1) Article 48(6) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) allows the European Council, acting by unanimity after consulting the European Parliament, the Commission and, in certain cases, the European Central Bank, to adopt a decision amending all or part of the provisions of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Such a decision may not increase the competences conferred on the Union in the Treaties and its entry into force is conditional upon its subsequent approval by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. (2) At the meeting of the European Council of 28 and 29 October 2010, the Heads of State or Government agreed on the need for Member States to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and invited the President of the European Council to undertake consultations with the members of the European Council on a limited treaty change required to that effect. (3) On 16 December 2010, the Belgian Government submitted, in accordance with Article 48(6), first subparagraph, of the TEU, a proposal for revising Article 136 of the TFEU by adding a paragraph under which the Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole and stating that the granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality. At the same time, the European Council adopted conclusions about the future stability mechanism (paragraphs 1 to 4). (4) The stability mechanism will provide the necessary tool for dealing with such cases of risk to the financial stability of the euro area as a whole as have been experienced in 2010, and hence help preserve the economic and financial stability of the Union itself. At its meeting of 16 and 17 December 2010, the European Council agreed that, as this mechanism is designed to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as whole, Article 122(2) of the TFEU will no longer be needed for such purposes. The Heads of State or Government therefore agreed that it should not be used for such purposes. (5) On 16 December 2010, the European Council decided to consult, in accordance with Article 48(6), second subparagraph, of the TEU, the European Parliament and the Commission, on the proposal. It also decided to consult the European Central Bank. [On [\u2026dates\u2026], the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Central Bank, respectively, adopted opinions on the proposal.] (6) The amendment concerns a provision contained in Part Three of the TFEU and it does not increase the competences conferred on the Union in the Treaties, 11. The European Council condemned the violence perpetrated since the second round of the presidential election in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, in particular the recourse to violence against civilians on 16 December. It called firmly on all the parties to act with restraint. It recalled the availability expressed by the International Criminal Court to prosecute the persons responsible for such acts. It called on all Ivorian leaders, both civilian and military who have not yet done so, to place themselves under the authority of the democratically elected President, Mr\u00b0Alassan Ouattara. It confirmed the determination of the EU to take targeted restrictive measures against those who would continue to obstruct the respect of the sovereign will expressed by the Ivorian people. 12. The European Council welcomed the successful outcome of the COP-16 in Cancun as an important step forward in global efforts to reach the agreed objective of staying below 2\u00b0C increase in global temperatures, and noted with satisfaction the successful implementation of the strategy it agreed in March. ANNEXES I. DRAFT EUROPEAN COUNCIL DECISION of \u2026 amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 48(6) thereof, Having regard to the proposal for revising Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union submitted to the European Council by the Belgian Government on 16 December 2010, [Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament, 1 ] [Having regard to the opinion of the European Commission, 2 ] [After obtaining the opinion of the European Central Bank, 3 ] Whereas: 1 Opinion of \u2026 (not yet published in the Official Journal). 2 Opinion of \u2026 (not yet published in the Official Journal). 3 Opinion of \u2026 (not yet published in the Official Journal).

        "(cid:31)(cid:31) On 28 - 29 October the European Council agreed on the need to set up a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. Eurogroup Ministers agreed that this European Stability Mechanism (ESM) will be based on the European Financial Stability Facility capable of providing financial assistance packages to euro area Member States under strict conditionality functioning according to the rules of the current EFSF. The ESM will complement the new framework of reinforced economic governance, aiming at an effective and rigorous economic surveillance, which will focus on prevention and will substantially reduce the probability of a crisis arising in the future. Rules will be adapted to provide for a case by case participation of private sector creditors, fully consistent with IMF policies. In all cases, in order to protect taxpayers' money, and to send a clear signal to private creditors that their claims are subordinated to those of the official sector, an ESM loan will enjoy preferred creditor status, junior only to the IMF loan. Assistance provided to a euro area Member State will be based on a stringent programme of economic and fiscal adjustment and on a rigorous debt sustainability analysis conducted by the European Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB. On this basis, the Eurogroup Ministers will take a unanimous decision on providing assistance. For countries considered solvent, on the basis of the debt sustainability analysis conducted by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB, the private sector creditors would be encouraged to maintain their exposure according to international rules and fully in line with the IMF practices. In the unexpected event that a country would appear to be insolvent , the Member State has to negotiate a comprehensive restructuring plan with its private sector creditors, in line with IMF practices with a view to restoring debt sustainability. If debt sustainability can be reached through these measures, the ESM may provide liquidity assistance. In order to facilitate this process, standardized and identical collective action clauses (CACs) will be included, in such a way as to preserve market liquidity, in the terms and conditions of all new euro area government bonds starting in June 2013. Those CACs would be consistent with those common under UK and US law after the G10 report on CACs, including aggregation clauses allowing all debt securities issued by a Member State to be considered together in negotiations. This would enable the creditors to pass a qualified majority decision agreeing a legally binding change to the terms of payment (standstill, extension of the maturity, interest-rate cut and/ or haircut) in the event that the debtor is unable to pay. Member States will strive to lengthen the maturities of their new bond emissions in the medium-term to avoid refinancing peaks. The overall effectiveness of this framework will be evaluated in 2016 by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB. We restate that any private sector involvement based on these terms and conditions would not be effective before mid-2013. HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The following paragraph shall be added to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: \"3. The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality.\" Article 2 Member States shall notify the Secretary-General of the Council without delay of the completion of the procedures for the approval of this Decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. This Decision shall enter into force on 1 January 2013, provided that all the notifications referred to in the first paragraph have been received, or, failing that, on the first day of the month following receipt of the last of the notifications referred to in the first paragraph. Article 3 This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Done at, For the European Council The President II. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE FUTURE MECHANISM \u2014 EUROGROUP STATEMENT OF 28 NOVEMBER 2010 \"The recent events have demonstrated that financial distress in one Member State can rapidly threaten macro-financial stability of the EU as a whole through various contagion channels. This is particularly true for the euro area where the economies, and the financial sectors in particular, are closely intertwined. Throughout the current crisis, euro area Member States have demonstrated their determination to take decisive and coordinated action to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole, if needed and return growth to a sustainable path. In particular, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) has been set up to provide for swift and effective liquidity assistance, together with the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the International Monetary Fund, and on the basis of stringent programmes of economic and fiscal policy adjustments to be implemented by the affected Member State and ensuring debt sustainability.

We are committed to ensuring the financial independence of the central banks of the Eurosystem. Elements of this strategy will be further developed in the coming months as a comprehensive response to any challenges, as part of our new economic governance. President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy has indicated that his proposal on limited treaty change to the European Council at its next meeting will reflect today's decision.\" III. STATEMENT BY THE HEADS OF STATE OR GOVERNMENT OF THE EURO AREA AND THE EU INSTITUTIONS The Heads of State or Government of the euro area and the EU institutions have made it clear, as set out below, that they stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole. The euro is and will remain a central part of European integration. In particular, the Heads called for determined action in the following areas: a) Fully implementing existing programmes: we welcome the impressive progress made in implementing the Greek programme and the agreed adjustment programme for Ireland, including the adoption of the 2011 budget. b) Keeping up fiscal responsibility: we are all committed to strictly implementing the budgetary policy recommendations, fully respecting the fiscal targets for 2010 and 2011 and to correcting excessive deficits within the agreed deadlines. c) Stepping up growth enhancing structural reforms: we are determined to accelerate structural reforms to enhance growth.
