        "1 Foreword Launched in 2010, the main aim of the Intra-ACP Academic Mobility Scheme is to promote sustainable development and poverty alleviation by increasing the number of highly trained, skilled and qualified personnel in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. A better access to quality education will encourage and enable students to undertake postgraduate studies, and will promote student and staff retention in the region. After four years of Programme implementation, the Intra-ACP scholarship holders were consulted to gather information about their mobility experience, from the stage of the application procedure to the end of the mobility. Inviting former and current scholarship holders to provide their feedback offers the possibility of identifying good practice examples and the challenges encountered, as well as to observe the Programme's impact on both the personal and professional development of the grantees. In total, 552 former and current scholarship holders were invited to take part in the survey. This number covers each student and staff member who was granted a mobility opportunity under the framework of the scheme between 2011 and November 2014. This publication presents the results of the analysis of the 274 questionnaires completed by scholarship holders of the partnerships from both Lot 1 \u2013 Africa and Lot 2 \u2013 the Caribbean and the Pacific. I believe that this survey, and the experience gained through the review process leading to its preparation, will provide the different stakeholders concerned with a useful source of information, since it shows very interesting and inspiring results. It will also be used by the Commission services as a source of inspiration to adapt and design the on-going and future programmes targeting these regions. Klaus HAUPT Head of Unit ",

        "3 Introduction Purpose of the present report The present document was prepared by the A3 Unit Erasmus+: Higher Education \u2013 Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degrees of the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) which is in charge of the management of the Intra-ACP Mobility Scheme, with the objective to present the results, recommendations and conclusions of a survey conducted at the end of 2014. The purpose of carrying out this Intra-ACP Mobility Survey was threefold. First, to analyse from the scholarship holders' point of view the implementation of the Intra-ACP Programme from the stage of the application procedure until the end of the mobility experience. Second, to find out what impact the Programme has had on both the personal and professional development of the grantees. Third, to identify good practice examples to contribute to a more accessible, efficient, transparent and sustainable academic mobility scheme, and serve as a basis for future evaluations. The targeted audience of this report are the stakeholders involved in the implementation of the Intra-ACP Academic Mobility Scheme, namely the European Commission, the African Union Commission (AUC) and the Secretariat of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States. Furthermore, it also contains valuable information and feedback for the coordinators and partners of the on-going projects. The Intra-ACP Academic Mobility Scheme The Intra-ACP Academic Mobility Scheme is being implemented within the framework of two highly political and important commitments of the European Union (EU) vis-\u00e0-vis the ACP Group of States and the African Union (AU). It is part of the Intra-ACP Strategy for the period 2008-2013, which was agreed upon between the EU and the ACP Group of States and which foresees the support of student mobility within the ACP countries through strengthening the AU Mwalimu Nyerere Scholarship Scheme, as well as setting up a similar scheme for the Caribbean and Pacific regions. The Programme is also in line with the EU's commitments to improve the quality of education and to favour regional integration as defined by the EU \"Agenda for Change\". It complements existing regional initiatives in the higher education sector such as the Pan- African University (PAU) flagship Programme of the AUC and is part of the Intra-ACP Strategy for the period 2008-2013, which was agreed upon between the EU and the ACP Group of States. ",
        "4 Objectives of the Programme The Intra-ACP Academic Mobility Scheme promotes higher education cooperation between countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. It funds partnerships between higher education institution (HEIs) from different countries within these regions and grants scholarships for students and staff to carry out studies, research, or teaching activities in another country covered by the Programme. The general objective of the Programme is to promote sustainable development and poverty alleviation by increasing the number of highly trained, skilled and qualified personnel in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Programme specific objective is to strengthen cooperation between HEIs in Africa and the Caribbean and Pacific regions. A better access to quality education will encourage and enable students to undertake postgraduate studies, and will promote student retention in the region along with staff mobility (academic and administrative), while increasing institutions attractiveness and supporting their internationalisation. Timeframe and budget For the 2010-2013 period, the Programme had an allocation of 45 million \u20ac (35 M \u20ac for Lot 1-Africa and 10 M \u20ac for Lot 2- Caribbean and Pacific). Three selections were organised in 2011, 2012 and 2013 which resulted in a total of 20 projects selected \u2013 15 in Lot 1 \u2013 Africa and 5 in Lot 2 \u2013 Caribbean and Pacific. Management of the Programme The EACEA is responsible for the management of the Programme with the support of the AU and the ACP Group of States. The Programme is placed under the supervision and funded by the Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission. ",
        "5 Methodology The survey was designed through the European Commission's \" EUSurvey\" tool and was accessible online in both English and French for a period of two weeks, between 3 November 2014 and 17 November 2014. The link to the questionnaire was disseminated by e-mail to the 552 former and current scholarship holders who were granted a mobility opportunity under the framework of the Intra-ACP Programme between 2011 and 2014. As a result of changes or deletion of certain e-mail accounts, approximately 50 participants could not be reached. In total, 274 scholarship holders (255 students and 19 staff members) of 9 on-going partnerships from both Lot 1 \u2013 Africa and Lot 2 \u2013 The Caribbean and the Pacific completed the survey. After data cleaning, 243 participants from Lot 1 could be identified while the sample of Lot 2 only comprises 31 respondents (representing only one partnership). Therefore, the results concerning the Caribbean and the Pacific region have to be carefully analysed and interpreted since their representativeness is limited. Also, in view of this difference between the numbers of replies received per lot, the combined statistics for both lots in the present document should be read as more representative for Lot 1 \u2013 Africa. Finally, the respondents represent 9 Intra-ACP projects (table 1), out of the 20 selected in the three Intra-ACP Calls for proposals, and mainly projects selected in the first Call (2011).

The aim was to collect information about the profile of the scholarship holders and analyse the implementation of the Programme from an academic, administrative and financial aspect. ",
        "6 The survey included single, multiple choice and scaling questions. Open questions with blank spaces for comments and recommendations were also proposed to deepen the analysis. In this context, it is to be taken into consideration while reading the survey results that the statistics do not always take into account all the 274 answers, but a set of replies relevant to the topic (e.g. for recognition of studies upon return the number of replies taken into consideration is the one of the students in exchange mobility who have already finished their mobility). ",
        "7 Overall Results Profile of the respondents Figure 1 gives an overview of some socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, which are presented by lot in figure 2 and 3. The overall proportion of male participants (64%) is almost twice as high as the ratio of females (36%). This result is far from the gender balance that the Programme strongly encourages. Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that the gender ratio varies a lot per type of mobility. The survey also sought to determine the origin of the participants in terms of their rural or city background. As figure 1, 2 and 3 illustrate, 88% of the participants live in either the country capital or a city, while 12% is from rural areas.

        "10 71% 19% 3% 7% 62% 31% 4% 3% As far as the type of mobility is concerned, the vast majority (93%) of the respondents were students either at Master or Doctorate level, while the two types of staff mobility (i.e. administrative and academic) constituted the remaining part of the respondents 7%. (figure 6). As already mentioned above, it is truly instructive to examine the distribution by gender/type of mobility (see figures 7 and 8). According to the results (male 86%; female 14%) and the submitted progress reports, there is scope for improvement in the participation of female doctoral candidates in order to ensure a more balanced participation at that level. The situation is much more balanced at Master level. Such results probably also reflect the situation in the countries concerned and the difficulty to reach an overall balance at doctoral level.

However, due to the sensitivity of this matter, only a limited number of questions were asked related to this aspect. As figure 10 shows, every second participant (50%) has never been abroad before his/her mobility and therefore, the Intra-ACP mobility offered for the majority of respondents the first-ever opportunity to do so. Figure 10 - Have you been abroad before? (Total respondents: n1=274, Yes: n2=136) ",
        "13 Yes 45% No 55% 26% 14% 29% 29% For study reason For professional reason For personal reason For academic reason 22% 45% 22% 11% For study reason For professional reason For personal reason For academic reason YES 87% NO 13% Figures 11 and 12 show data disaggregated by Lot. Those who had already crossed the border of their countries most often had done so for professional and academic or study reasons. Remarkably, the personal motive was ranked last (14%) among Lot 1, whereas it was the top reason (45%) in the case of Lot 2. Academic aspects In total, 77% of the respondents indicated that the academic content of the mobility experience was either excellent or good. Specifically within the Lots, the academic content was rated as good, excellent, or adequate by 91% of Lot and by 100% of Lot 2. This result corresponds to the answers received from the respondents regarding the competence and knowledge of the professors and academic personnel at the host university. 96% found it excellent, good, or adequate, while when comparing the announced academic objectives versus what was actually implemented during the mobility, two third (66%) considered the academic objectives consistent. Even though the respondents were fairly positive about the academic aspects, they noted that a better organisation of studies should be encouraged, which would facilitate a more effective learning experience. This element is further explained in the next section. Figure 11 - Have you been abroad before? (Lot 1 - Africa: n1=243, Yes: n2=109) Figure 12 - Have you been abroad before? (Lot 2 - Caribbean and the Pacific: n1=31; Yes: n2=27) ",
        "14 50% 50% Exchange mobility In total, 22% of the exchange mobility was still on-going when this survey was carried out, while 78% of this group had already completed their experience (see figure 13 below). The recognition of studies by the home university is considered crucial for a successful Intra-ACP academic mobility and figure 13 below shows that 56% of the respondents who had finished their mobility had their studies recognized without any difficulty. By contrast, 29% did not know yet the result of the process and 15% did not succeed. The survey sought to understand the reasons behind the unsuccessful recognition of studies and therefore students were asked to specify their answers. Based on their responses, the following factors were identified: Full degree mobility Only 31 out of 183 students (17%) have finished their full degree mobility, namely 29 of 159 students (18%) within Lot 1 and only 2 of 24 students (8%) within Lot 2. These students were further asked whether they received a diploma and for those who did, what kind of diploma was received (see figure 14). The results need to be interpreted with caution considering the limited number of respondents. 57% 16% 27% 1. Exchange mobility was recognized as a training only; 2. The home university was not partner of any Intra-ACP partnership; 3. The followed course had no equivalent at the home university. Lot 1 - Africa: (n=52) Lot 2 \u2013 Caribbean and the Pacific (n=4) Figure 13 - Recognition of the studies upon return (n=56) ",
        "15 It is also inappropriate to make any further conclusions for Lot 2 because only one student had received his/her diploma among only two that had finished their mobility. The free text replies show that some of these mobilities were terminated early and therefore did not lead to a diploma. Moreover, some of the diploma issuing procedures were still in progress at the time of the survey. Administrative aspects The survey also aimed at learning about the administrative aspects of the implementation of mobility and included questions about the application and selection procedure, the learning and student agreement, as well as about the logistics and services provided before and during the mobility. Submission of applications 70% of the respondents submitted their application via the project website. This clearly shows that the projects' official websites were easy to find and functioning accurately. 25% applied for the scholarship by e-mail and only 5% chose the traditional paper based application. For Lot 1, 67% applied via the project website, 6% by paper application, and 27% by email. For Lot 2, almost all applications (94%) were sent through the project website while 6% by email. Selection procedure and communication of results Besides the application procedure, participants were asked to evaluate the selection criteria, the transparency of the selection procedure, and the overall communication during the application and selection procedure. The majority of the participants were Double/multiple degree 6% Diploma supplement 18% Transcript of records 59% Other 17% Figure 14 - Have you received a diploma? (n=31) If so, what type of diploma?

        "16 satisfied and evaluated the above mentioned three components excellent, good or adequate. According to the responses reflected in figure 15 above, the partnerships have created and implemented transparent application and selection procedures which guaranteed that each criterion was clearly set and disseminated to the potential candidates. This is, furthermore, supported by an efficient and appropriate overall communication from the side of the partnership. However, a small percentage experienced a late communication of the selection results. Among the respondents, 87% stated that they received the notification of their scholarship early enough to get prepared and complete the necessary official procedures while 13% stated that they did not. This, without doubts, should be further improved to ensure that participants have enough time to complete the visa issuing procedure and get prepared for their period abroad. 39% 35% 38% 39% 37% 39% 39% 19% 36% 39% 39% 38% 40% 38% 38% 32% 52% 35% 16% 18% 15% 14% 17% 14% 26% 29% 26% 5% 6% 7% 6% 6% 8% 3% 3% 1% 2% 2% 1% 2% 1% Very transparent/Excellent Transparent/Good Adequate Unclear/Inadequate Very unclear/very inadequate Total respondents: n = 274 Lot 1 - Africa: n = 243 Figure 15 - Application and selection procedure Lot 2 \u2013 Caribbean and the Pacific: n = 31 ",

Furthermore, after the notification of the scholarship, 57% of the respondents, i.e. more than every second grantee had to start an admission process which was often mentioned as a heavy burden by the respondents. Learning and Student Agreement The student agreements and the learning agreements and work programmes are important documents which indicate all the contractual rights and obligations of the scholarship holder and also provide guarantee for the recognition of the studies in case of student mobility. Having these agreements signed by both parties is therefore essential and makes figures 16 and 17 truly instructive. One of the lessons learnt from the present study is that in several cases, the scholarship holders started their mobility without duly signed documents. In addition, a significant percentage of respondents indicated that they had never underwritten such agreements. Few of these people specified in their answers that they had heard about an agreement signed on their behalf by the representative of their home university rather than a student agreement signed by themselves.

Considering that some projects did better than others regarding the management of student agreements and learning agreements (for master students) and research/work programmes (for doctoral candidates), the corresponding sections of the four projects selected in 2011 further examines the answers and recommendations of the scholarship holders. Logistics and services The survey measured the following eight aspects linked to the logistics and services provided by the host institution before and during the mobility: 1. Social activities 2. Language courses 3. Health Insurance 4. Daily life 5. Banking 6. Visa/Residence permit 7. Housing 8. Travel and local transportation The results are generally positive. Nevertheless, a significant part of the respondents experienced a variety of issues and challenges regarding one or some of these aspects. Figures 18 and 19 show that many scholarship holders were in need of an increased number of social activities to foster a smooth start of their mobility. More information and guidance related to housing, banking and local transportation should be provided to ensure that scholarship holders have easy access to all services in the hosting country. Late delivery of health insurance was also mentioned as a frequent difficulty.

In both cases, the percentage is quite high when referring to language courses not being offered and to an inadequate offer. In spite of the above presented experiences, numerous students and staff members expressed their gratitude towards the coordinators of their host institution for their accessibility, helpfulness and assistance that enabled them to pursue a highly valuable mobility period and make the most out of it. On the other hand, a few grantees reported about unreachable and less supportive coordinators who paid little attention to those international students.

        "21 Financial aspects Various financial aspects have been analysed in relation with the management of the scholarships. Above all, it must be noted that there are immense differences regarding the answers between the different projects. Some of them perform well while others needed corrective measures, according to the replies. As regards the scholarships, they are most often transferred to the scholarship holders' bank account (58%) while cash is used in 28% of all the cases. 14% of the respondents received their grants in the form of a combination of these two. In terms of payment currencies, more than two third (69%) of the respondents got their allowance in the local currency, Euros were used in 27% of the cases and 4% was paid in a different currency, mostly in US dollars. As a consequence of the applied changing rates, several participants considered the received amount being different from the one stated in the Student Agreement. As figure 22 presents below, the ratio of those receiving their grants after arriving in the host country is above 80% and between 8-12% of all the respondents indicated they had not yet received any allowance at the time of the survey. Figure 22 - Payment of the settling-in and first monthly allowance Indeed, the timely payment of allowances emerged as one of the weaknesses in managing the projects and this aspect would need to be improved so as to avoid additional obstacles for financially constrained scholarship holders. Among the respondents that received their allowances, more than one-third got the allowances at least a month after the start of the mobility (see figures 23 and 24).

It is to be mentioned however that some 45 respondents did not provide a reply on the question related to the delay in payments of the settling-in allowance. The regularity of payments is another issue regularly mentioned by the respondents notably from Lot 1. As figure 25 presents, 36% answered that they received the allowance every third month while 18% did not experience any regularity at all. Participants who did not receive timely payment of allowances gave recommendations on how to improve the procedures. 42% 20% 21% 17% 0-2 weeks later 2-4 weeks later 4-6 weeks later I received it later 36% 22% 22% 20% 80% 7% 13% Figure 23 - Delay in payments: Settling-in allowance Figure 24 - Delay in payments: First monthly allowance 41 % 16 % 13 % 30 % ",

Regarding the interpersonal skills, 18% reported positive impact on their personality and 8% on their social and/or private life. Overall, more than four-fifth (83%) of the respondents stated that the mobility offered a high or very high increase in professional competences and skills, while the ratio of those Figure 25 - Regularity of payments \"The Intra-ACP has been a very impacting experience whereas I have been able to clearly trace the level of my professional development and the new or improved competencies I now possess.\" Doctorate student from Guyana, CARPIMS project Figure 26- Impact of Intra-ACP experience (n=274) ",
        "24 who found it low, very low or not applicable is only 3%. Respondents felt that the greatest impact of the mobility overall had been on a combination of professional career and specialised knowledge. Having the opportunity to study, teach, or conduct research in a different country enhanced their professional capacity, increased their career perspectives, positively impacted their values and attitudes, and contributed to their knowledge on the profession. Positive results were also registered on professional and personal development. The mobility helped the participants to have better problem-solving skills, become more self- confident, to hold stronger self-management abilities, to express themselves more clearly, to become more flexible and to be able to use one or more foreign languages. Figure 28 shows the corresponding percentages for these skills developed by the respondents. For Lot 1, the top four skills developed were problem-solving (27%), self-management (14%) and communication skills (14%). For Lot 2, there was a tie between self-confidence, self- management and communication skills (17%), followed by problem solving skills (16%). Figure 28 - Impact of Intra-ACP experience on professional and personal competences (Lots 1 + 2) It appears that achieving these objectives had contributed to the enthusiasm of the respondents to participate in the mobility programmes. 40% 42% 18% 17% 32% 34% 8% 7% 2% Lot 1 - Africa. n = 243 Lot 2 - Caribbean and the Pacific. n = 31 Professional career Personality Specialised knowledge Social/private life Other Figure 27 - Impact of Intra-ACP experience (by lot) ",
        "25 Globally, the outflow of these well-educated and experienced professionals is a general concern, which is often referred to as brain-drain. However, 100% of the respondents declared that they did or will return to their home country, at the latest, within a few years after their mobility. Many of them emphasized the importance of contributing to the development of their respective countries. Students were also asked to assess the impact of their intra-ACP mobility on the home institution. Participants see the greatest influence of such mobility projects on the development of joint research projects and publications. Indeed, this was ranked first (32%) and new/strengthened institutional cooperation links second (25%). 18% of the respondents considered that the Programme also contributes to the development of new teaching and learning methods. ",
        "26 ",
        "27 Conclusion Overall, the mobility opportunities offered by the Intra-ACP Academic Mobility Scheme has had a substantial impact at individual level. More than 80% of the respondents have greatly valued their experience as having allowed a high or very high increase in their professional competences and skills. All the scholarship holders did or intend to return to their home country, at the latest within a few years after their mobility. Beyond the impact on the individuals, respondents admitted that the Intra-ACP projects have also had an impact at their home university, having contributed to the development of joint research projects, new teaching and learning methods and strengthened institutional cooperation links among participating higher education institutions. However, the survey reveals a certain number of shortcomings which will need to be addressed in order to ensure the impact of the Programme. Gender Balance Whereas there is good balance at Master level, the situation at Doctoral level and in staff mobility needs to be improved (83% male doctoral candidates versus 14% female - 70% male administrative staff versus 30% female). Partnerships should put in place mechanisms to guarantee gender balance and provide all the candidates equal access to the mobility opportunities. Support provided by the institutions Many respondent expressed satisfaction regarding the accessibility, helpfulness and assistance of the Coordinator and the hosting institution. However, although overall the communication was rated adequate and above 91% of the respondents, some students complained about late information on the selection results. The partnerships should therefore ensure that the selection results are communicated on time to allow ample time for visa applications and other travel arrangements. There was a general success in the respondents' ratings of logistics and services provided during the mobility. Most services were evaluated adequate and above: social activities \u2013 61%, daily life \u2013 78%, banking \u2013 80%, housing \u2013 69%, travel and local transportation \u2013 76%. There is, however, still room for improvement and all host institutions should ensure that they have sufficient resources and well trained coordinators who pay enough attention to the grantees. Only 58% of respondents were provided adequate health insurance during their mobility. Partnerships should be reminded that all of the participants should be provided with a proper health insurance as stated in the Call. ",
        "28 Recognition aspects In terms of recognition of studies, 56% of respondents who completed their credit- seeking mobility had their studies recognised without difficulty. There are still some 15 % whose study period abroad was not recognised and a number of students (29%) that have not been aware of the recognition status of their studies. These results bring the importance of reminding the issue of recognition to all selected partnerships and call for additional efforts in this regard. Yet, the limited number of respondents having completed a degree-seeking mobility does not allow for a general conclusion on the recognition of the received diploma. Several scholarship holders either started their mobility before signing the student agreement and learning agreement or research/work programme or did not sign at all. For example, 42% of the student respondents did not sign any student agreement and 53% of the staff respondents did not sign any work programme. Particular attention on these mandatory documents has to be paid by the partnership so as to ensure that both the scholarship conditions and the learning/research/work programme and outcomes are well communicated and understood by the scholarship holders. Financial issues Aside the exchange rates and mode of payment issues faced by the respondents, between 8 \u2013 12% of the respondents had not received any allowances at the time of completing the survey. All partnerships should take prompt measures to guarantee the on-time payment of both the settling-in and monthly allowances. ",
