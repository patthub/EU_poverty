Two percent of the rural population in Burkina Faso has access to electricity and supply is lacking at many social structures such as schools and hospitals. Energy access achievements in Burkina Faso are still very modest. The rural electrification strategy for Burkina Faso is scattered in several electricity sector development policies: there is a need of defining a concrete action plan. Planning and coordination between grid extension and off-grid electrification programmes is essential to reach a long-term sustainable energy model and to avoid high unnecessary infrastructure investments. This report describes the development and the results obtained with a dynamic planning tool to support national government and development partners in defining an alternative electrification plan. Currently, the common national policy for electrification is dominated almost exclusively by grid extension with the government subsidising fossil fuel electricity production. However, the results of our analysis suggest that an electrification plan mainly based on further grid extension becomes inefficient and unsustainable in order to reach the national energy access targets. Our results also suggest that Burkina Faso\u2019s rural electrification strategy should be driven by distributed mini- grids powered by local renewable resources. We find that this approach would connect more people to power more quickly, and would reduce imported fossil fuel dependence/consumption that would otherwise be necessary for grid extension options.

Cette nouvelle vision consiste \u00e0 une transition vers les \u00e9nergies vertes et renouvelables, avec un accent particulier sur l\u2019\u00e9nergie solaire. Elle se justifie par un contexte international marqu\u00e9 par la lutte contre le changement climatique et ses effets n\u00e9fastes, et une situation nationale caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par un faible acc\u00e8s des populations aux services \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques modernes avec pourtant un fort potentiel solaire sous-exploit\u00e9 et une biomasse abondante non valoris\u00e9e. La nouvelle politique d\u00e9crite dans le Plan National de D\u00e9veloppement Economique et Social (PNDES) se mat\u00e9rialise par des projets ambitieux de syst\u00e8mes de production d\u2019\u00e9nergies renouvelables \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9chelles de la cha\u00eene d\u2019approvisionnement \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique du Burkina.

Pour faciliter l\u2019entr\u00e9e des capitaux priv\u00e9s dans le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et tirer plein profit du d\u00e9veloppement des \u00e9nergies renouvelables, le Gouvernement a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une nouvelle loi r\u00e8glementant le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, vot\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e nationale le jeudi 20 avril 2017. Cette loi fixe le cadre l\u00e9gal d\u2019exercice des activit\u00e9s de production, de distribution et de transport de l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique, supprime la segmentation g\u00e9ographique du secteur et les monopoles associ\u00e9s, et trace les lignes propices au d\u00e9veloppement des \u00e9nergies renouvelables et \u00e0 la promotion de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique.

        "2 Foreword For several decades, the energy sector in Burkina Faso has been characterised by a dominance of the traditional use of biomass, by a primarily thermal productivity of electricity at national level (based on imported fossil fuels) and, below the demand from a population that is constantly growing, by one of the highest costs of electricity in the region. Since last year, the sector has been in a process of complete transformation guided by a new policy approach. This new vision consists of a transition to green and renewable energies with an emphasis on solar energy. It is aligned within the international context marked by the fight against climate change and its detrimental effects. The new policy is reinforced by the fact that Burkina Faso does not have much access to modern energy services and yet has untapped solar and biomass energy resources. The new policy outlined in the national economic and social development plan is materialised by ambitious renewable energy projects. These include large-scale photovoltaic projects connected to the national grid, isolated solar or hybrid mini-grids in rural areas and the promotion of solar and bioenergy stand-alone systems. In order to facilitate the investments of private capital into the energy sector and to promote the development of cost-effective renewable energy projects, the government launched a new law regulating the energy sector. The law was voted in the National Assembly on 20 April this year and establishes the legal framework for the production, distribution and transmission of electricity, removes the geographical segmentation of the sector and the associated monopolies and lays down the guidelines to promote the development of renewable energies and energy-efficiency measures. In the current policy context of Burkina Faso\u2019s energy transition, this report by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission appears to provide essential support and be a real tool for decision-making. It presents all the aspects of the country\u2019s energy situation, highlights the current challenges of people\u2019s access to modern energies, proposes a tool for comparative studies of electricity generation and planning systems adapted to the rural world, and highlights recommendations that corroborate the right political choice of the country to achieve the goal of \u2018sustainable energy for all\u2019.

        "4 Foreword Burkina Faso: mapping the least costly options for rural electrification Access to sustainable and affordable energy services in sub-Saharan Africa is limited and remains a critical challenge for the economic growth and industrialisation of the continent. Burkina Faso in particular suffers from a very low level of access to modern energies (18.83 %), especially in rural areas (3.06 %). Africa\u2019s energy sector presents vast business and investment opportunities, thus boosting growth and jobs, in particular in the field of renewable energy technologies. The new European Consensus on Development and a renewed partnership with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States focus on the close coordination of two priorities: increasing access to sustainable and affordable energy and tackling climate change. In Burkina Faso, the European Union actively contributes to the energy sector. It has investments in large infrastructures, promotes rural electrification and supports the government in the implementation of enabling policies and regulatory frameworks that aim to promote a healthy business environment and boost private and public investments. This European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) Science for Policy report entitled \u2018Mapping the least-cost option for rural electrification in Burkina Faso\u2019 shows the commitment of the European Union in supporting Africa and Burkina Faso in the energy sector at scientific level as well. The report developed a new methodology based on processes of spatial analysis in order to provide a possible pathway for universal electricity access through a sustainable energy mix. The model developed for the Burkina Faso case is the result of a collaboration between the JRC and the Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which resulted in the development of a support tool for planning strategies in the energy sector at continental level (ECOWAS Observatory for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency).

        "6 R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Le Burkina Faso est un pays sah\u00e9lien enclav\u00e9 en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest. Il a une superficie de 274,222 km 2 et, en 2015, une population de 18,4 millions de personnes avec une croissance d\u00e9mographique annuelle de 3,1 % [1]. En 2012, la population rurale repr\u00e9sentait 72 % de la population totale. Dans les zones rurales, la majorit\u00e9 de la population (environ 90 %) utilise toujours la biomasse traditionnelle (bois de chauffage et charbon de bois) comment principale source d\u2019\u00e9nergie. Contexte politique Le contexte \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique du Burkina Faso se caract\u00e9rise par: i) une pr\u00e9dominance de la consommation d\u2019\u00e9nergie de la biomasse, qui repr\u00e9sente 80 % de la consommation d\u2019\u00e9nergie primaire; ii) une d\u00e9pendance aux combustibles fossiles import\u00e9s; iii) un tr\u00e8s faible d\u00e9ploiement d\u2019\u00e9nergie renouvelable; et iv) un faible acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nergie moderne et un manque d\u2019approvisionnement en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dans de nombreuses structures sociales telles que les \u00e9coles et les h\u00f4pitaux. Au Burkina Faso, seulement 3 % de la population rurale a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 Le pourcentage de la population ayant acc\u00e8s aux services \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques modernes au Burkina Faso est encore tr\u00e8s faible (18,83 % de la population a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9). Les disparit\u00e9s g\u00e9ographiques sont importantes: en 2015, seulement 3,06 % de la population rurale a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 alors que le pourcentage de la population urbaine atteint jusqu\u2019\u00e0 60 %. La priorit\u00e9 du gouvernement est de faire progresser l\u2019\u00e9lectrification rurale nationale \u00e0 45 % d\u2019ici \u00e0 2030. La consommation annuelle d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 par habitant est de 44 kWh au Burkina Faso, contre 200 kWh au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et 270 kWh en C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. L\u2019offre en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 actuelle au Burkina Faso est bas\u00e9e sur les importations, la production de combustibles fossiles et l\u2019hydro\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Le pays d\u00e9pend fortement des importations. L\u2019extension du r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique se d\u00e9veloppe \u00e0 un rythme beaucoup plus lent que pr\u00e9vu. L\u2019offre en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 du Burkina Faso repose principalement sur la production de combustibles fossiles et thermiques (environ 63 % de l\u2019offre totale en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9), la totalit\u00e9 des combustibles fossiles \u00e9tant import\u00e9s. En outre, la part de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 import\u00e9e, principalement en provenance des pays sous instabilit\u00e9 politique (par exemple la C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), augmente (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 31 % en 2015). Cette situation de d\u00e9pendance \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique et la fluctuation constante des prix du p\u00e9trole multiplient les probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique. Le Burkina Faso d\u00e9tient toujours un des co\u00fbts d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s (0,21 euro par kWh) par rapport \u00e0 ses pays voisins. Depuis 2010, le co\u00fbt moyen de la production d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 son prix de vente. Pour att\u00e9nuer l\u2019\u00e9quilibre n\u00e9gatif de la compagnie nationale d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (Sonabel), l\u2019\u00c9tat accorde \u00e0 Sonabel une subvention annuelle: en 2014, l\u2019\u00c9tat a allou\u00e9 aux compagnies nationales d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et d\u2019hydrocarbures des subventions aux carburants d\u2019une valeur de 28 milliards de francs CFA (43 millions d\u2019euros). Les difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res de Sonabel ont entrav\u00e9 la r\u00e9habilitation et la maintenance des r\u00e9seaux \u00e9lectriques et de la flotte vieillissante de centrales \u00e9lectriques. Ce rapport d\u00e9crit un outil d\u2019analyse spatiale pour \u00e9valuer les voies vers une \u00e9lectrification rurale durable et son application au Burkina Faso. Les r\u00e9sultats aideront le gouvernement du Burkina Faso et les partenaires au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les options d\u2019\u00e9lectrification rurale les moins co\u00fbteuses dans le cadre du plan national de mesures \u00ab\u00c9nergie durable pour tous\u00bb (Systainable Energy for All \u2014 SE4ALL).

Conclusions principales Les projets d\u2019\u00e9lectrification locaux et plus petits, bas\u00e9s sur des ressources locales devraient, \u00e0 long terme, \u00eatre plus r\u00e9alisables que les projets centralis\u00e9s bas\u00e9s sur des combustibles fossiles import\u00e9s. Nos r\u00e9sultats sugg\u00e8rent que 65 % des \u00e9tablissements non \u00e9lectrifi\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre desservis par des technologies d\u00e9centralis\u00e9es. Ce rapport met en lumi\u00e8re l\u2019important potentiel photovolta\u00efque(PV) au Burkina Faso et montre des r\u00e9sultats qui peuvent accro\u00eetre la volont\u00e9 du gouvernement et des organisations internationales de d\u00e9ployer des \u00e9nergies renouvelables sur son territoire. Le rapport compare les options de la technologie \u00e9lectrique en fonction des ressources locales disponibles (petites centrales hydro\u00e9lectriques et PV solaire) avec des ressources de combustibles fossiles import\u00e9es (g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice diesel ou extension du r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique) dans le but d\u2019une optimisation moins co\u00fbteuse. Les r\u00e9sultats sugg\u00e8rent clairement qu\u2019une plus grande int\u00e9gration des \u00e9nergies renouvelables dans l\u2019approvisionnement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9, une diminution de la domination actuelle des combustibles fossiles et l\u2019\u00e9limination des subventions des combustibles fossiles est la strat\u00e9gie la plus rentable. Les minir\u00e9seaux PV (bas\u00e9s sur les syst\u00e8mes photovolta\u00efques coupl\u00e9s aux piles) sont l\u2019option technologique la plus appropri\u00e9e. En raison des conditions g\u00e9ographiques, hydrologiques et climatiques du pays, la production d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 hydro\u00e9lectrique par la rivi\u00e8re ne semble pas \u00eatre r\u00e9alisable ni optimale. Des \u00e9tudes ant\u00e9rieures indiquent que les ressources \u00e9oliennes sont tr\u00e8s faibles. L\u2019option du g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur diesel n\u2019est ni souhaitable ni appropri\u00e9e en tant qu\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9lectrification rurale en raison de la forte d\u00e9pendance des importations de carburants et de l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts due au transport des combustibles. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, l\u2019\u00e9pine dorsale de la politique nationale d\u2019\u00e9lectrification est l\u2019extension de r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique. Cependant, la charge \u00e9conomique pour d\u00e9velopper et maintenir le r\u00e9seau national devrait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e et n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019option la moins co\u00fbteuse. Ainsi, la planification devrait \u00e9galement tenir compte de l\u2019option concurrentielle des minir\u00e9seaux aliment\u00e9s par des ressources renouvelables locales. Selon notre mod\u00e8le, l\u2019investissement cumul\u00e9 requis au Burkina Faso afin d\u2019atteindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s universel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 d\u2019ici \u00e0 2030, y compris l\u2019approvisionnement de la population d\u00e9j\u00e0 reli\u00e9e au r\u00e9seau mais sans acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, est d\u2019environ 1,7 milliard d\u2019euros. En ce qui concerne les aspects \u00e9conomiques, le rapport pr\u00e9sente une approche qui peut r\u00e9duire le co\u00fbt marginal de l\u2019\u00e9lectrification rurale au Burkina Faso gr\u00e2ce au d\u00e9ploiement de 374 m\u00e9gawatts cr\u00eate (MWc) suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019installations photovolta\u00efques d\u00e9centralis\u00e9es.

        "9 Executive summary Burkina Faso is a West African landlocked Sahelian country. It has a surface area of 274,222 km 2 and, in 2015, had a population of 18.4 million with a 3.1 % annual population growth [1]. In 2012 the rural population made up 72 % of the total population. In rural areas, the majority of the population (about 90 %) still relies on traditional biomass (firewood and charcoal) as their main energy source. Policy context Burkina Faso\u2019s energy context is characterised by: (i) a predominance of biomass energy use with 80 % of the primary energy consumption; (ii) a dependence on imported fossil fuels; (iii) a very low deployment of renewable energy technologies; and (iv) limited access to modern energy and electricity supplies that lack at many social structures such as schools and hospitals. In Burkina Faso, only 3 % of the rural population has access to electricity. The percentage of the population that has access to modern energy services is still very low (18.83 % has access to electricity). Geographical disparities are significant: in 2015 only 3.06 % of the rural population had access to electricity, while in the case of the urban population the figure increased up to 60 %. The government\u2019s priority is to scale up national rural electrification to 45 % by the year 2030. The annual electricity consumption per capita is 44 kWh, compared with 200 kWh in Senegal and 270 kWh in the Ivory Coast. The current electricity mix is based on electricity imports, fossil fuel generation and hydropower. Burkina Faso heavily depends on imports. Grid extension is developing at a much slower pace than planned. Burkina Faso\u2019s electricity mix mainly relies on thermal and fossil fuel generation (about 63 % of the total electricity mix), with the entirety of fossil fuels being imported . Additionally, the share of imported electricity is increasing (up to 31 % in 2015), mostly from countries under political instability (e.g. the Ivory Coast). This situation of energy dependency and the constant fluctuation of oil prices raise energy security issues. Burkina Faso still has one of the highest costs of electricity (0.21 EUR/kWh) compared to its neighbouring countries. Since 2010, the average cost of electricity production was higher than its selling price. To mitigate the resulting negative balance of the national electricity company, Sonabel, the state grants it a yearly bridge subsidy: in 2014, the state allocated fuel subsidies worth CFA 28 billion (EUR 43 million) to the national power and hydrocarbon companies. Sonabel\u2019s financial difficulties have hampered the rehabilitation and maintenance of electricity networks and the ageing fleet of power plants. This report describes a spatial analysis tool for assessing pathways towards sustainable rural electrification and its application to Burkina Faso. Findings shall support the Burkina Faso government and development partners to define the least-cost rural electrification options within the framework of the national action plans of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL). Planning and coordination between grid extension and off-grid electrification programmes are essential to reach a long-term sustainable energy model and to avoid high infrastructure investments. At the moment in Burkina Faso there is no specific master plan for the development of renewable energy technologies at country level (apart from some general indications from ECOWAS). The JRC spatial analysis tool presented in this report can be influential at an early development stage to overcome the limitations of the current scattered national planning and to increase the probability of achieving the national goals of SE4ALL. The objectives envisaged by the government are to reach a global 95 % of electricity access (50 % in rural areas) and universal access to clean cooking solutions in urban areas (65 % in rural areas) by 2030. The ",
        "10 government has also set a target of 50 % of renewable energy in the electric mix by 2030 (without biomass). Key conclusions and main findings Smaller local electrification projects based on indigenous resources are in the long term expected to be more feasible than centralised ones based on imported fossil fuels. Our results suggest that up to 65 % of the non- electrified settlements are to be served by decentralised technologies. This report highlights the substantial photovoltaic (PV) potential in Burkina Faso and shows results that may increase the willingness of the government and of international organisations to deploy renewable energies in its territory. The report compares electricity technology options based on the available local resources (small hydropower and solar PV) to imported fossil fuel resources (diesel generator or grid extension) by means of least-cost optimisation. The results strongly suggest that an increase in the integration of renewable energy in the overall electricity supply and a decrease in the current dominance of fossil fuels is the most cost-effective strategy, including the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies. PV mini-grids (based on PV systems coupled with batteries) are the most suitable technology option. While due to the geographic, hydrologic and climatic conditions of the country, a run-of-the-river hydropower electricity generation does not seem to be feasible or optimal. Previous studies indicate that wind resources are very low. The diesel generator option is neither suitable nor appropriate as a rural electrification option due to the high dependency on fuel imports and the increasing costs due to fuel transportation. The backbone of the national policy for electrification is currently grid extension. However, the economic burden to develop and maintain the national grid is expected to be very high and not necessarily the least-cost option. Therefore, planning should also consider the competitive option of mini-grids fed with local renewable resources. According to our model, the required cumulative investment for Burkina Faso to reach universal access to electricity by 2030 is about EUR 1.7 billion, including electricity provision to the population of settlements already connected but without access to electricity. As far as economic aspects are concerned, this report shows one potential approach that reduces the marginal cost of rural electrification in Burkina Faso through the deployment of an additional 374 MW p of decentralised PV systems. This action could also potentially yield annual emissions savings that would equal 162,000 tonnes of CO 2 , estimated by using Burkina Faso\u2019s grid emission factor of 0.70 tCO 2 /MWh. Burkina Faso\u2019s government determines its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in its \u2018intended nationally determined contributions\u2019; the associated investment costs under the mitigation scenarios for the energy sector are calculated as EUR 1.1 billion. Defining the source of capital/funds is beyond the scope of the present study; specific literature on this topic implies several financial and incentive schemes to support the deployment of decentralised energy. Related and future JRC work In recent years, the JRC has developed a least-cost methodology aimed at guiding policymakers in the African continent to set up reliable alternatives to a rural electrification paradigm that heavily relies on fossil fuels. The methodology was developed at a continental level as an interactive tool (see RE2nAF). Following a JRC collaboration with the Africa-based research institution, the Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECOWAS-ECREEE), a similar geographic information system- based tool was developed. Tightly linking the Burkina Faso electrification plan to such tools could help to attract international support for electrification projects. ",
        "11 In the present study, wind and hydro resources have been included as static mapping. The next step to enhance the interactive tool would be to integrate wind and hydro technologies as dynamic parameters. As a follow-up, we aim to apply this methodology to a number of additional countries. Our goal is to extend the RE2nAF interactive tool to identify additional opportunities. This would involve supporting national/regional rural electrification plans with up-to-date information on countries selected in cooperation with DG International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission. A key factor for the validation of the methodology is to enhance transparency and update field costs for the energy technology options. ",
        "12 1 Introduction: Burkina Faso\u2019s energy context Burkina Faso is a West African landlocked Sahelian country. It has a surface area of 274,222 km 2 surface and in 2015 a population of 18.4 million [2] with a 3.1 % annual population growth [1,3,4]. Burkina Faso\u2019s energy context is characterised by: (i) predominance of biomass energy use with an 80% of the primary energy consumption (see Figure 1); (ii) dependence on imported fossil fuels (see Figure 1); (iii) very low deployment of renewable energy technologies; and (iv) low access to modern energy [5]. The amount of population with access to modern energy services in Burkina Faso is still very low (18.83 % of the population has access to electricity), with only 2.3 % of the rural population having access to electricity [5]. Figure 1. Primary energy consumption in Burkina Faso (2012). Source: SONABEL [6,7] and MMCE [8] This section presents the current energy policy context of the country, the challenges and perspectives to reach an alternative electricity mix that could support a robust national development strategy coupling growth and sustainability and pursuing the energy-related sustainable energy goals in the SDG, as stated in the SE4ALL National Plan of Actions [9,10]. The SE4ALL implementation is followed by a focal point in the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy (MMCE). The MMCE was divided in 2016 in two ministries: Ministry of energy (ME) and Ministry of Mines and Quarries (MMC). 1.1 Present electricity mix The electricity production of Burkina Faso in 2015 mainly relied on hydropower (6 % of total electricity capacity) and thermal-fossil fuel generation (about 63 % of the total power generation capacity) [11]. All petroleum products are entirely dependent on imports by road at high cost from ports over 1,000 km away, since the country has no known crude oil reserves or refining capacity. As for natural gas, Burkina Faso has no natural gas production, consumption, or reserves. In rural areas the main energy source is the utilisation of traditional biomass [12]. A combination of market and steadily increasing demand for electricity has contributed to a major shift in the Burkina Faso electricity mix from 2007 to 2015 (Figure 2). Burkina Faso has increased its dependency on electricity imports (up to 31 % in 2015) from its neighbours Ghana, Togo and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Figure 3). Imports have increased because of the new Bobo-Ouaga transmission line connected in 2010, and due to the lower electricity cost of the electricity imports compared to the electricity produced in Burkina Faso by thermal power fuelled by high-cost imported oil.

        "14 1.2 An alternative to the present energy mix Burkina Faso is in the process to define an integrated national renewable energy programme (see section 1.3). The recent establishment of the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Energies Renouvelables (DGER), the Direction Generale de l\u2019Efficacit\u00e9 Energ\u00e9tique (DGEE), and the new agency dedicated to renewable energy and energy (ANEREE) will accelerate the implementation of such specific programme. Burkina Faso may seriously consider an alternative energy mix to ensure a substantial increase in the country\u2019s power supply to meet the fast-growing electricity demand and to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation [18] (see section 8). In this framework, the Department of Energy is establishing an institutional and regulatory framework for the recent launch of the national renewable energy agency. The new agency will accelerate the implementation of incentive mechanisms for a greater use of indigenous renewable energy sources [11, 12]. \u2014 Hydropower generation has limited potential mainly due to the irregular precipitation pattern. Hydropower already provides 8 % of the total electricity consumption (2015) assuring an average production of 100 GWh (55 to 135 GWh per year depending on rainfall) [20]. \u2014 In spite of the country's high solar energy potential [21], the installed PV capacity in 2014 was less than 7,000 kW p [20]. In 2014, solar energy represented 0.8 % of the total national electricity consumption. However, the implementation of PV projects in Burkina Faso has been accelerating since 2014 with a 30% increase of installed capacity per year. \u2014 Wind energy is the least advantageous form of renewable energy for Burkina Faso, given the low wind speeds. There have been, nonetheless, some studies suggesting relatively higher wind energy potential in Dori, in the Sahel region [22], [23]. However, in Sahel region the solar potential is higher than the average (1,650 kWh/kWp) [24] and comparatively 2.3 times higher than wind potential (700 kWh/kWp). 1.3 Strengthening the institutional, legislative and regulatory framework for the electricity sector 1.3.1 Challenges for the electricity sector With regard to the electricity sector, the country is confronted with two main challenges: i) the need to ensure a substantial increase in the country\u2019s power supply to meet a fast- growing demand; ii) the need to supply electricity to several urban and rural settlements while improving the reliability and quality of the overall service. In order to face these challenges and to strengthen the institutional, legislative and regulatory framework for the electricity sector the former Ministry of Mines and Quarries Minist\u00e8re des Mines, et de l\u2019Energie (MMCE) set up several policy instruments and strategies as shown in Table I. Since 2016, the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Energie (DGE) are converted to three general directions: Direction Generale des Energies Renouvelables (DGER), Direction Generale des Energies Conventionnelles (DGEC) and Direction Generale de l'Efficacit\u00e9 Energ\u00e9tique (DGEE). The Energy Ministry has written a new policy for the energy sector (LPSE) in 2016, and a new energy law is being voted at the national assembly. In the field of energy in Burkina Faso, the Energy Sector Policy Letter (LPSE) of the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Quarries reflects the vision of the presidential program and the National Plan for Economic and Social Development (PNDES). It has opted unequivocally for an energy transition towards green and renewable energies, in particular towards solar energy. This in order to make energy \"accessible and available\" through the energy mix by increasing the share of renewable energies in current production, promoting energy efficiency and strengthening the production of conventional energies. Reforms of the institutional, legislative and regulatory framework are therefore needed. ",
        "15 1.3.2 National strategy for growth and sustainable development A few policy documents have set the scene for growth and sustainability in Burkina Faso specifically mentioning the energy issues. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) [25] was the central framework of the government\u2019s economic and social development policies from 2000 to 2010. The PRSP identified the lack of infrastructure as a major impediment to poverty reduction. The PRSP Priority Action Programme envisaged an increase in the country\u2019s electricity access rate from 17% in 2008 to 26% in 2012. In 2011, the Strategy for Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD) [19] replaced the PRSP. The SCADD integrates several options to develop the electricity sector. These options are: a) the establishment of institutional and regulatory frameworks and fiscal measures that allow the mobilisation of actors and financial resources in the energy sector; b) to secure the country's supply and reduce energy costs; c) the extension of electricity networks to rural areas; d) mobilisation of national energy potential and its development and e) to improve the efficiency of energy consumption. In October 2013, the National Policy for Sustainable Development in Burkina Faso (PNDD) [26] was published. The PNDD contains provisions to assess the progress of the SCADD and the National Rural Sector Programme (NRHP). The main instruments for the assessment are the National Observatory for Environment and Sustainable Development (ONEDD) [27] and the criteria and indicators for sustainable development (CSD and ISD) described in the Institutional Framework for Sustainable Development (IFSD) [28] (see Figure 4). Since August 2016, the Government has a new development plan: the National Policy for Sustainable Economic and Social Development (PNDES) 2016-2020 [1]. The PNDES is the reference document of the strategy and actions of the Government of Burkina Faso for the period 2016-2020 to achieve its development objectives. The plan is based on three main pillars: (i) institutional reform and modernization of the administration; (ii) human capital development; (iii) boosting enabling sectors to create decent jobs.

        "19 1.3.3 Establishment of a national renewable energy agency Till 2016, there were no integrated policies or strategic directions for the use of renewable energy technologies (RET). However, in 2016 the Government announced an important change of energy policy by make a strong transition towards renewable energy. Very recently (October 2016) the Ministry of Energy created a new agency dedicated to renewable energy and energy efficiency, \u2018Agence Nationale des Energies Renouvelables et l'Efficacit\u00e9 Energ\u00e9tique\u2019 (ANEREE). The main missions of the ANEREE are: 1) Control, supervise and promote the market for renewable energies and energy efficiency 2) Establish a National Energy Efficiency Promotion Strategy. 3) Support, enhance and pilot projects of national scope in the field of renewable energies and energy efficiency. 4) \u2013Unify and integrate private sector, NGOs and technical and financial partners in the field of renewable energies and energy efficiency 5) -Executing commercial services and all other public service missions in the field of renewable energies and energy efficiency. 6) Support research, innovation and training in the field of renewable energies and energy efficiency. Table II gathers the main instruments and tools that support the development of renewable energy technologies in Burkina Faso. The Department of Energy is establishing an institutional and regulatory framework for the creation of a Renewable Energy Agency and to implement incentive mechanisms for greater use of indigenous renewable energy as stipulated in the Strategy for Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD) [19]. Thus, the Government has planned to conduct a study to provide the most suitable institutional arrangements and organisation to support the development of the renewable energy sub-sector. Adopted in 2007, the strategy for rural electrification supports solar energy for the electrification of rural areas lacking connection to the SONABEL grid. The United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) report provides information about small hydropower status and its potential [33]. The UNIDO study identifies 70 potential small hydropower sites with a total capacity of 139 MW (with 32 MW hydropower sites already installed in 2015). The wind energy atlas [23] assesses the potential of wind average speeds in Burkina Faso at a 30, 50 (small and medium turbines) and 80m (large turbines). The average wind speed ranges between 1 and 3 m/s, with the maximum only obtained in the north (up to 6 m/s for 50 m height). ",

        "22 2 Strengthening the institutional, legislative and regulatory framework for rural electrification In 2015, only about 18.8 % of the population had access to electricity. Geographical disparities are huge: only 3% of the rural population has access to electricity while the percentage with respect to the urban population increases to 60% in 2015 [19,45,46]. The annual electricity consumption per capita is 44 kWh in Burkina Faso, compared with 200 kWh in Senegal, and 270 kWh in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In the rural areas of Burkina Faso, the majority of the population (about 90 %) is still relying on traditional biomass (firewood and charcoal) as the main energy source [12]. 2.1 Electrification strategy at national level Electricity is important for rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation. With regard to the electricity sector, Burkina Faso is confronted with an imminent challenge: the need to supply electricity to several urban and rural settlements while improving the reliability and quality of the overall service. The country\u2019s electricity supply strategy is mainly based on establishing interconnections with neighbouring countries and the refurbishment and extension of the existing network. To a much smaller extent it supports the development of local generation capacity. The country's electricity supply is mainly managed by the national electricity company, which is a public company. SONABEL is fully responsible for the production, import and distribution of electricity in Burkina Faso. In 2014, there were no private producers of electricity on the grid. Nonetheless, Burkina Faso adopted an electricity law allowing the liberalisation to the private sector, yet did not privatise the national electricity company. 2.2 Specific regulatory framework for rural electrification The national strategy for electricity access is not defined in one single regulatory framework but enclosed into several sustainable development policies (see section 1.3.2). Rural electrification pace and achievements in Burkina Faso are still very modest (Figure 5). Figure 5. Additional settlements electrified per year. Source: JRC compiled from INSD (2016) [2]. An appropriate rural electrification master plan can be useful for policy-makers to set the policy direction, to develop coordinated programmes and to set the roadmap for rural ",
        "23 electrification. The long-term programme has to take account of recent political instability (failed coup) and political unrest in the neighbourhood countries (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mali) due to the high-energy dependence of energy imports. 2.2.1 Assessment studies for national rural electrification Several studies for the assessment of a potential national rural electrification plan have been conducted (see Figure 6) but still one single regulatory framework would much facilitate the implementation of a unified strategy for rural electrification. With regard to new electrification, the Rural Electrification Fund (FDE) is responsible for rural electrification programmes, whereas SONABEL electrifies peri-urban areas near the existing grid [47].

In 2008, the \u201cDirection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Energie\u201d DGE commissioned a study to assess the national programme for rural electrification [31]. The Government decided to base the country\u2019s electricity supply strategy on mainly establishing interconnections with neighbouring countries and the rehabilitation and extension of the existing network while supporting the development of local generation capacity. Local generation was based in multiple purpose platforms, isolated grid projects, and solar PV systems [47]. \u2014 Electricity Infrastructure Strengthening and Rural Electrification Project - Feasibility study of the rural electrification priority programme completed in October 2007 financed by the African Development Bank. \u2014 Electrification Plan Programme (2013-105) for more than 600 settlements in Burkina Faso .

This rural electrification programme was completed in 2014 with the technical assistance and financing of the EU, French Development Agency, World Bank, India Aid and the African Development Bank. The studies for the assessment of a national rural electrification plan conducted so far mainly focus on grid extension projects (2006). However, the assessments are slowly increasing the use of decentralised energy technologies (2015, 2016).

The FDE is the entity of the Ministry of Energy that facilitates, implements and finances the rural electrification policy. The mission of the fund is to facilitate access to electricity for the rural population by providing loan guarantees and subsidies to rural electrification investments and preparatory studies. The targets for rural electrification set by the FDE are summarised in Table IV . Table IV . Electrification access targeted by FDE (2012) Objective Past achievements Progress indicators Main orientation Electrification of 60 communities per year 40 communities electrified Access rate: 13% Access rate: Population living in an electrified area/Total population Electrification of over 400 communities by 2015 22 feasibility studies financed Electrification rate: 2 % Electrification rate: Number of electrified communities/Total number of communities Implementation of the National White Paper recommendations regarding energy access Source: CLUB-ER [50] Electrification Development Taxes ( Taxe de D\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019Electrification rurale, TDE): The government took an important measure by introducing an electrification development tax exclusively for investment in electricity infrastructure in rural areas (2 FCFA/kWh, equivalent to 0.03 cEUR/kWh) [51] and the tax exemption for 5 years on the exploitation of renewable energy equipment [52] ( ",

In 2013, 17 communities were electrified with funding from the TDE-2012 (12 communities electrified by the TDE-2013 funding). According to the rural electrification strategy paper (2008), the needs for financing for the period 2007-2020 are 5.6 billion FCFA/year, equivalent to 8.5 million EUR/year (for 10 to 20 settlements/year), the share of the TDE is not negligible in this investment.

Burkina Faso uses a small-scale priority investment approach, where the investments are identified by individual feasibility studies prepared by the FDE. The investment and operation is entrusted to installers while the ownership of assets goes to the national power company for MV-lines and to local community cooperatives for LV-lines. Supported electrification projects are implemented by electricity cooperatives and operated by private firms under an \u2019investment plus 5 year of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract\u2018 [47].

The project is under negotiation for an additional USD 17.5 million. As part of this new funding, 50 more communities could benefit from electrification through interconnection to the national grid and the construction of hybrid diesel/PV power stations. 2.3.2 Electricity cooperative Coop\u00e9ratives d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (COOPEL) groups 60 cooperatives and an operator (\u2018fermier\u2018). COOPEL works with the FDE under the \u2018Electricity for All\u2019 programme. Local cooperatives produce and distribute electricity on the territories not connected to the grid and are part of an umbrella organisation, the National Union of Electric Cooperatives in Burkina Faso (UNCOOPEL). The implementation of the COOPEL is heavily subsidised (investment subsidy, exemption from VAT, 80 % subsidy on the price of diesel). Electricity can be purchased via the cooperative at wholesale prices and can be resold at retail price. The electricity price for customers in rural areas is equivalent to SONABEL prices. 2.3.3 Multipurpose platform projects The Program of Multifunctional Platforms (supported by UNDP) involves local communities and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Projects usually include diesel generation, mills, battery chargers and pumps; a set of installations is chosen by the community with the aim of increasing productivity using electricity [47]. An interesting feature in Burkina Faso is the role of women\u2019s associations in the management of these multipurpose platforms. 619 communities (development centres) have been identified as priority candidates and are under screening to identify the most appropriate energy supply for each community [30] (see Figure 8). Figure 8.

In the case of Burkina Faso, the technical studies were inspired from ECOWAS since 2015 (PANER and PANEE) [37,38] but its implementation has been hampered by the socio-political crisis that the country has experienced from 2014 to 2015. 2.4 National and regional targets for electricity access The PRSP Priority Action Programme forecasted an increase in the country\u2019s electricity access rate from 17 % in 2008 to 26 % in 2012, but the actual increase was lower reaching 16 % of population. In 2015, 39 % of the population lived in areas with electricity services (coverage rate) and the country had an increase in electricity demand at a rate close to 10 % per year. In 2015, only 18.8 % of population had access to electricity, with huge disparities still present between areas: only 3 % of the rural population had access to electricity while in urban centres this rate reached 60 % [45], EICVM data 2009/2010 [19,46,53] ",

In 2011, SONABEL aimed to achieve a goal of electrification of 60 % in 2015 [13,55] starting from the baseline of 13.1 % in 2010 [3] and the envisages by the SE4All objectives are to reach a national electricity access of 65% (95% in urban areas and 50 % in rural areas) by 2030. While ECOWAS was targeting at regional level universal access to electricity by 2030 [39]. Still, the targets for access to electricity set by the government at country level and ECOWAS at regional level are far from being reached (see Figure 10). Indeed, the new actual plans stated by the Government [1] are more ambitious with challenging goals for 2020: 80 % of electricity coverage 45 % of national electrification rate (19 % of rural electrification and 75 % of urban electrification) 30 % of renewable energy in the energy mix (from 6.4 % in 2015) ",
        "31 3 Infrastructure: the electricity network in Burkina Faso Planning and coordination between grid extension and off-grid electrification programmes is essential to reach a long-term sustainable energy model and avoid duplication of infrastructure investments. This section analyses the status of the grid and its plans for extension. Section 8 will comparatively assess the competitiveness of these plans with off-grid options. 3.1 Status of the grid Burkina Faso historically had two electricity networks, independent from each other. Since 2009, these two networks are interconnected (Interconnected National Network). This report refers to the electric-power transmission as the bulk infrastructure aimed at transferring electrical energy, from generating power plants to electrical substations located near demand centres. The electric power distribution refers to the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers. The analysis provided in this report involves the combined existing or planned transmission lines (90, 132, 225 and 330 kV) and the existing or planned distribution network (33kV lines) in Burkina Faso. The 33 kV network is used both as a distribution network and as a network for transporting electricity from the power stations (interconnected network). The low-voltage network is generally three-phase except in some rural areas where the single-phase technique is used. Figure 11.

        "32 3.1.1 Quality of grid service Over last years, interruptions in the interconnected areas have increased (for data on electricity interruptions in 2008, please refer to the bottom-right graph included in Figure 12). The main causes for load shedding (when there is not enough electricity available to meet the demand) are (1) significant increase in demand recorded during the hot season (air-conditioning electricity use increases by 8% of the total services) and a large new connection of new customers in the Ouagadougou region; and (2) an increased unavailability of the interconnection with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (15 % of the total services) [7]. On top of these facts, the current grid is in a delicate ageing situation [58,59]: according to a World Bank report [59] the percentage of assets older than 30 years is at 50 % for the transmission lines and 32 % for the distribution lines [60] (see Table VI). Table VI. Electricity network status in Burkina Faso Length Asset value Percentage of assets older than 30 years Refurbishment cost (*) (km) (EUR million) (weighted average) (EUR million) Transmission 1,161 155 50 46 Distribution 6,396 247 32 47 Source: World Bank, AICD [59]. *Refurbishment Cost (Asset value x Assets older than 30 years % x 60 %) In 2011 and 2012, SONABEL hired 61 MW of short-term emergency diesel generators in order to have a fast solution to cover the failure of electricity delivery from the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire caused by a mix of political and technical problems. The rental contract ended in 2012. To face the critical power supply situation, SONABEL paid FCFA 28 billion (EUR 42 million) for the production of 235 GWh. In comparison, imports from Cote d\u2019Ivoire generated gains of FCFA 17.6 billion over the 2 years. 3.2 Policy of grid expansion and scheduling failure SONABEL local development policy and interconnection is based on first creating the backbone of the grid and then expanding the distribution network. In 2015, the 225 kV High Voltage (HV) interconnection from Cote d\u2019Ivoire supplied around 30 % of the electricity requested by the Burkina Faso network. A second high voltage interconnection (225 kV) with Ghana (Bolgatanga-Ouagadougou) is scheduled to be commissioned in 2017. Two other regional interconnections are planned under the WAPP project [11], a 330 kV transmission line (Nigeria-Niger-Burkina Faso-Benin) and the Ghana-Burkina Faso\u2013Mali 225 kV interconnection line. As previously mentioned, the backbone of the grid experienced a degree of improvement in 2009 thanks to the interconnection of the two previously isolated electricity networks. Still, the expansion of the distribution and transmission network has followed a pace much slower than planned [32]. According to the latest data available (2016), approximately 6,000 km of distribution lines originally planned to be in place before 2014 are yet to be built. Figure 12 provides the spatial illustration of the current status of the existing national grid in Burkina Faso 1 . 1 From the existing medium and low lines, Figure 11 only includes the 33 kV lines. Single-wire earth return (SWER) lines and 11 kV lines are not included (around 8,600 according to SONABEL). This exclusion might also explain the differences with the distribution length reported in Table VI. ",

Single-wire earth return lines and 11 kV lines are not included Source : JRC compiled from SONABEL [16,54] The amount of times in one year that the grid has experienced power outage in 2008 and the corresponding amount of electricity non-distributed to the users caused by the power outage are illustrated in Figure 13. Figure 13. Status of the national grid Source: JRC compiled from World Bank, AICD [58,59] 2 According to the latest 2016 SONABEL report [15] the existing high-voltage transmission lines in 2015 were: 488 km for 225 kV, 315 km for 132 kV and 142 km for 90 kV. For the medium voltage lines (33 kV and 20 kV) there is a total length of 4,243km. There are around 8,700 km of low tension lines. ",
        "34 These facts reinforce the need to look for a faster and more effective rural electrification approach and a tailored rural electrification option that gives a stronger role to lower capital investments using reliable and indigenous sources. 3.3 Potential of large PV grid-connected systems to prevent shortage of supply in hot season The daily load curve of SONABEL is characterised by an evening peak during rainy season (from May/June to September) and a day peak during the dry period. During the seasonal peak power consumption (hot season), air conditioning in the Ouagadougou region absorbs from 30 to 80 MW (from a total of 180 MW). The generation of solar energy at the peak power consumption (the so called \u2018peak shaving\u2019) can help to prevent the power blackouts and offset the increasing power demand in the country. Over the past decade, electricity demand has increased by about 13 %, while supply has increased by just 8 % [5]. The peak demand in 2015 was 244 MW for a total consumption (including imported electricity) of 1,442 GWh. With the goal of reducing the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation Burkina Faso has the ambition to install 225 MW p solar power plants by 2020 (see Figure 14) that would generate about 360 GWh of electricity production [21], at around 20 % of the total consumption for 2020. Figure 14. The injection of PV electricity to the main grid in Burkina Faso might offset the increase in power demand and prevent power cuts in hot season Source : JRC compiled with data from PVGIS [21], WAPP [13], EIA [14], United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs [15], World Bank's Development Indicator data [3] and SONABEL [7]. Despite the relatively high up-front cost of large PV power plants, the operation of the solar power plant in a high irradiation country such as Burkina Faso results in lower costs than the power produced by imported coal or diesel, even taking into account amortisation of the initial investments. Indeed, the development of high voltage interconnections will enable the Burkina Faso transmission network to increase its capacity to penetrate electricity generated from large PV solar fields. ",
        "35 3.3.1 Identification of high energy demand centres in Burkina Faso that are highly compatible with solar energy technologies The government intends to install, through public-private partnerships, 5 large PV systems of 10 MW p . The mining sector in Burkina Faso is one of the largest electricity consumers, so the location of PV production at high-energy demand sites would be particularly feasible reducing the country \u2019 s vulnerability to energy supplies, reducing the transmission-associated losses and increasing the access to electricity in neighbouring rural communities 3 [61]. Figure 15. Identification of high-energy demand centres attractive for solar energy technologies Source: JRC with data/mapping from Programmation r\u00e9gionale MEPRED [30]. Burkina Faso has an important need of energy demand for large irrigation systems (more than 100 locations identified in Figure 15). A solar irrigation pump system could significantly enhance incomes in remote areas by providing a cost-effective way of delivering irrigation water, particularly during the long dry season, replacing diesel powered pumps with solar pumps [62]. The cost of a solar PV water pumping system without any subsidy is 60 % of the cost of the diesel pump, over a life-cycle of 10 years [63]. 3 CDM Zina, 2015 Canadian mining company based in Burkina Faso will install a 22 MWp capacity facility in Zina. The plant will be connected to SONABEL\u2019s main power grid. ",
        "36 4 Infrastructure: Fossil fuel power plants and renewable energy installations According to SONABEL, the installed capacity in 2015 was 325 MW, with 293 MW supplied by 24 thermal power plants and 32 MW by 4 hydropower plants [16]. In 1999, nine small-scale hydropower sites with a total of 36 MW were identified. Currently, only two small hydropower plants exist Tourni (0.5 MW) and Niofila (1.5 MW). from a total potential of 139 MW [33,64]. The estimated total annual electricity production is 1 GWh. The energy input for fossil fuel plants in 2013 was of 5 618 TJ (with an estimated 40 % of production to input) [13]. In 2015, the fossil fuel consumed for electricity production was 191,349 tones with an average of consumption of 211 g/kWh. 4.1 Projected and reinforcement of heavy fuel oil plants Several fossil fuel plants are in the process of reinforcement or implementation [13], [16]: - Extension of the Bobo II plant by an addition of 40 MW capacity. - Reinforcement of heavy fuel oil plant of 90 MW in Komsilga. - Heavy fuel oil plant of 20 MW in Sore. - The Electricity Sector Support Project (PASEL/World Bank) supports the construction of two thermal stations (Ouahigouya and Fada N\u2019Gourma). However, the Ouahigouya station has been suspended [5]. - Connection of isolated centres (13.5 MW) to the main grid mainly run by diesel generators [65]. 4.2 Projected hydroelectric plants - Hydroelectric plant of 60 MW at the border with Ghana on the site of Noumbiel. The estimated total annual electricity production is 203 GWh, 80 % of which will be diverted to Burkina Faso and 20 % to Ghana. - A dam with a hydroelectric plant of 12 MW in Bougouriba (2016-2020) with estimated total annual electricity production of 30 GWh. - A dam with a hydroelectric plant of 14 MW in Bagre-Aval (2017-2019) with an estimated total annual electricity production of 37.3 GWh. - A 2.5 small hydropower MW plant is in the pipeline to be built at Samendeni Dam and two additional mini hydropower plants are planned, including Bonvale [33,64]. 4.3 Wind energy farms The potential for wind power is very limited, given the low wind speeds. Accordingly, there are no wind farms installed in Burkina Faso. However, small-scale generators at suitable sites and for selective purposes (e.g. water pumping, desalination systems) might be feasible. JRC is in the phase of extending its least-cost modelling to wind potential. ",

Total cost including the connection to high voltage network is EUR 47.5 million. It is financed by the AFD (EUR 22.5 million loan to the State, reallocated as a grant to SONABEL) and the European Union (EUR 25 million grant). The cost of construction and operation is much lower than the initial estimates made in 2010 (EUR 63 million). The PV plant could deliver around 4,000 MWh/month to the main grid during the hot season, helping to prevent a shortage of supply. Despite the relatively high up-front cost of a total of EUR 47.5 million (1.4 EUR/W p ), the operation of the solar power plant in a high irradiation country such as Burkina Faso will be able to produce electricity at lower price compared to SONABEL\u2019s current cost.

Despite the high level of government yearly subsidy, Burkina Faso still has one of the highest costs of electricity (0.21 EUR/kWh) compared to its neighbouring countries. Since 2010, the average cost of electricity is higher than its selling price. In 2015, SONABEL\u2019s average selling price was 122 FCFA/kWh (0.19 EUR/kWh), against an average generation cost of 139 FCFA/kWh (0.21 EUR/kWh) resulting in the loss of 17.1 FCFA per kWh sold (0.03 EUR/kWh). Indeed, the net result for the financial year 2015 was a deficit of more than FCFA 17 billion (EUR 26 million). To reduce SONABEL losses the Government failed to authorize the readjustment of tariffs and therefore the State grants SONABEL with a bridge yearly subsidy [5,71]. ",

In the case of isolated areas, the government is granting a subsidy on fuel used for electricity production in isolated centers with the scope harmonising the kWh prices in rural areas with those within SONABEL perimeters. The total FDE funding for rural electrification projects takes place through a combination of upfront investment grants and interest rate free loans; however, more financial assistance is often needed because many households cannot pay the full cost of operation. 5.2 Financial and operational sustainability The constant fluctuation of oil prices and the import dependence in Burkina Faso remains one of the main obstacles for thermal generation [72]. Figure 20. Evolution of average annual diesel prices in Ouagadougou Source: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale burkinab\u00e9 d\u2019hydrocarbures (SONABHY) and INSD 2016 [2] In addition to the balancing subsidy, the State has undertaken to grant a subsidy to SONABHY to maintain the prices of fuel supplied to SONABEL for electricity generation at FCFA 405 per litre of distillate diesel oil (DDO) and FCFA 280 per litre of heavy fuel oil (HFO). However, the State\u2019s limited cash-flow situation makes difficult to deliver financial resources to SONABHY and SONABEL. In 2015, the SONABEL balancing subsidy debts totalled to CFAF 51 billion (EUR 78 million) [5] . SONABEL\u2019s financial difficulties are largely responsible for the delays in the rehabilitation and maintenance of electrical networks and some power plants. Moreover, financial situation also disrupt fuel supply. In 2015, SONABEL had virtually no fuel reserves for the main thermal power generation centres (less than a day of production) although SONABEL was expected to have safety stock fuel reserves (lasting at least 20 days of ",

        "45 6 Key planning steps in a systematic approach for country- level validation The purpose of this report is to support the Burkina Faso government and development partners to provide tools for assessing and defining options for the least-cost rural electrification technologies. In recent years, JRC has developed a least-cost methodology aimed at guiding policy-makers in the African continent in setting up credible alternatives to a rural electrification paradigm based heavily on fossil fuels [73,74]. The methodology was developed at continental level and relies on datasets available on a global level. When applied at country level, the same methodology could provide more accurate results by addressing the information gaps existing at continental level. For this reason, when the methodology has to be applied at country-level, the key planning steps described in Figure 21 are applied in order to improve the analysis and achieve better results. Figure 21. Approach for validation of continental methodology at country level This approach has been followed in Burkina Faso case, refining the least-cost methodology by acquiring more detailed and updated data at country and local levels (see section 8). 6.1 Consultation with main national and regional stakeholders A consultation by telephone and email with the main national and regional stakeholders involved in the national rural electrification policies (see the complete list in Table XI) was performed to integrate the national conditions and understand what their needs would be and the most useful way to use the tool. The question of whether they would be willing to consider the results of the study in their RE master plan was also examined. The process consisted of: - Data gathering with the collaboration of national authorities (Table XI) in charge of energy development, finance, environment and energy ministries, international, regional and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academia and the EC delegation. - Discussion with national authorities in charge of energy development to incorporate the final results of the study in their rural electrification master plans and what would be the most useful way to use the tools.

        "51 7 Rural electrification planning tool: Least-cost electricity option for Burkina Faso The use of spatial analysis in the frame of decision support tools has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in the definition of general rules for a more functional rural electrification plan at national level in Africa [75\u201381]. The JRC georeferenced electrification tool used in this report aims to support the Burkina Faso government and development partners to define a coordinated plan for electrification, focusing on different technological choices The methodology in this report is presented in detail in a scientific article published by the authors [82] and will be briefly summarised in the next subsections. 7.1 Methodology: Calculation of geo-referenced least-cost option The methodology and the main steps used in this study are illustrated in the simplified logical framework (Figure 22). The optimisation process detects the least-cost option for each settlement by comparing four electricity generation technologies (grid extension, diesel genset, PV and small-scale hydropower).

        "52 The developed methodology includes geospatial analysis and mapping, in a way that harmonises and integrates global and regional databases. The identified input data for the analysis and the corresponding sources are: -Administrative areas, settlement locations and distribution of population [83,84]. -Transmission network: The existing and planned transmission networks have been compiled from several sources of information [49,82,83,85]. -Power stations: existing and planned [49,85]. -Hydrological and solar resources [21,86\u201390]. -PV, battery, Balance of Systems (BOS), Operation and Maintenance (O&M) prices, lifetimes and national diesel prices [72,91\u201393]. -Travel time to main cities: Dataset of accessibility [94]. -Electricity demand per settlement. There is a lack of detailed data on rural electricity demand in Burkina Faso. The electricity demand projection (Figure 3) is based on population estimations provided by the United Nations [15] for Burkina Faso, in combination with the average household\u2019s population and electricity consumption data from INSD [84,95], and IMPROVES [83]. The daily profile of the electricity load is estimated considering the data available in government records (FDE database_2014; personal communication) and INSD [2,45] for settlements in rural areas and energy use in social infrastructure [96,97], and population for each location (see Table XII for assumptions considered).

        "53 The elaborated geoprocessing builds on spatial numerical operations within GIS environment and also applies functions of remote sensing and satellite image processing, through the evaluation of long-period meteorological data [21,100,101]. For each settlement, starting from the geospatial analysis, the cost of each electrification technology is evaluated with a specific cost model. In the final step the least-cost technology among the four studied options is detected and represents the optimal option. 7.1.1 Hydropower The hydrogeographic conditions of Burkina Faso can be described by the location of the country (continental, landlocked country with savannahs and a desert area in the north), by the relief (fairly flat plateau; average altitude is 400 m, lowest point is 125 m, highest point is 749 m) and its hot and arid tropical climate of the Sudanese and Sahelian type. Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons: a long dry season from October to April and a short rainy season from May/June to September. Seventy percent of the annual total rainfall occurs in July through to September. There are three climatic regions: (i) The north of the country belongs to the Sahelian zone with a very short and moderate rainy season. This area typically receives less than 600 mm of rainfall and the dry season can last between 8 and 10 months. (ii) The largest climatic zone is the Sudano-Sahelian zone, which covers central Burkina Faso. Precipitation is higher than in the north, but rarely goes beyond 1000 mm. (iii) Southern Burkina Faso is covered by the Sudanian zone, which is the most humid of the regions. Its rainy season lasts 6 months with rainfall of up to 1,300mm (Figure 23 A). In accordance with the climatic conditions, most of the streams can be characterised by seasonal flow. Three main river basins drain the surface of the country; Volta (65 %), Niger (29 %) and Como\u00e9 (6 %) (Figure 23 B). Figure 23. (A) Climate zones and (B) main river basins in Burkina Faso Source : (A) [102], (B) Authors based on [87,89] The suitability mapping of potential small-scale hydropower plants focused on run-of-the- river technologies that do not require the construction of dams [101]. Hydropower potential can be defined using different approaches. The \u2018technical\u2019 hydropower potential gives the potential electric power \u2019that could be, or have been developed, considering current technology, regardless of economic and other restrictions\u2019 [103]. The site- selection procedure is based on evaluation of hydro-geographical circumstances, including drainage properties derived from the digital terrain model, climatic conditions and river regimes (discharge variability, perennial or intermittent watercourses). In the initial phase of the modelling the physical constrains of potential locations have been delineated using a continental scale data set [104]. Based on the hydrographical ",
        "54 characteristics and detailed description of African river data, river segments and suitable area fulfilling the following criteria had been selected as potential locations of mini hydro systems: - permanent river (from VMAP0) [105]; - river gradient or surface gradient along the river > 1 % (derived from SRTM30) [106]; - catchment size > 100 km 2 (calculation based on HydroSHEDS) [107]; - mean annual stream flow > 4 m 3 /s (GRDC) [108]. The processed and combined GIS data resulted in a binary map of suitable and non- suitable areas. Distance analysis and cost estimation have been performed to estimate \u2018economic\u2019 and \u2018exploitable\u2019 potentials and thus, mapping potential locations of run-of- river hydropower generation [101]. The authors previously performed a similar analysis on the European scale. Since datasets for river discharge and available hydraulic head in Europe are more detailed than the African ones, the present study adapted to the local status. Thus, the required riverbed gradient (1 %) is higher than the one for Europe (0.5 %), in order to stay on the safe side. The estimation of the electricity production cost from this technology was based on our previous studies [100] (0.15 EUR/kWh) combined with the additional costs due to distance between the customer location and the closest suitable river section. The lifetime production costs have been calculated taking into account the average lifetime, the investment and operation cost of the hydropower plants projects in Africa [100,109]. The grid extension cost from the closest permanent river to a local grid has been set at 0.025 EUR/kWh/km [100]. 7.1.2 Diesel genset The cost of electricity from diesel gensets is calculated following the methodology described in [110]. For diesel gensets, fuel consumption is the major portion of the costs. To estimate the location-specific operating costs for diesel gensets (that derives from the transport of fuel from the closest bigger city assumed to have a fuel station), the national diesel price has been combined with the transport cost of diesel for each location. The travel time data was derived from the \u2018Global map of accessibility\u2019 in Nelson [94]. The computations are performed in three main steps. Step 1. Transport costs for diesel: (cid:2)(cid:3) = (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10) ( Eq. 1 ) Where: - (cid:11) (cid:9) : is the transport costs (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17) - (cid:11) (cid:18) : is the national market price for diesel (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17) - (cid:19) is the diesel consumption per hour (cid:13) (cid:20) \u210e(cid:17) \u2044 - (cid:3) is the travel time (cid:13)h(cid:17) - (cid:24) is the volume of diesel transported (cid:13)l(cid:17) Step 2. Production cost for electricity is calculated as: Pp = (Pd + Pt)\u03b7 ( Eq. 2 ) Where: - (cid:11) \" : is the production cost for electricity (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) #$\u210e \u2044 (cid:17) - \u03b7 is the conversion efficiency of the generator (cid:13)(cid:20) #$\u210e \u2044 (cid:17) Step 3. The final costs of electricity consist of the production costs and the costs of labour, maintenance and amortisation. For this, (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) #$\u210e \u2044 (cid:17) unit costs are calculated using the commercial price and the average lifetime for the 4\u201315 kW diesel generators. The input parameters for the electricity costs of diesel genset are: ",
        "55 - Lifetime of the diesel genset: 10,000 hours. On average generators would last from 1 to 5 years [111], with most of them ranging in the lower lifetime line. - National retail diesel price: 1.00 EUR/l (2011) range between 2008-2016: 0.94-1.04 EUR/l. - Fuel consumption of the genset with a conversion efficiency ( \u03b7 ) of 0.286 (cid:13)(cid:20) #$\u210e \u2044 (cid:17) [112]. 7.1.3 Solar PV Solar energy production is modelled using hourly solar radiation data derived from satellite observations [113], [114] as the number of solar irradiation field measurements in Burkina Faso is limited to 10 principal meteorological stations [115]. The optimisation algorithm is applied at each location using the hourly solar irradiance data from PVGIS [21], the calculation of the system performance ratio, the calculation of the PV system/battery size ratio and load demand profile for each settlement (considering the existing social infrastructure and domestic consumption for each settlement). The input parameters for the calculation of the off-grid PV electricity costs are: - PV module price: 0.83 EUR/W p (2014); Balance-of-System (BOS) components: 1.0 EUR/W p . - Batteries lifetime: 5 years; Battery price: 122 EUR/kWh. - System is optimized so that energy delivery will fail due to empty batteries on less than 5% of days. - Operation and Maintenance (O&M) annual costs: 2 % of the capital expenditure; - PV system lifetime: 20 years. - 70 % system performance ratio for the PV systems, also considering the losses in charging and discharging of batteries. - Capital cost of construction of the minigrid including replacements of BOS. - Cost of capital as discount rate: 5 %; depreciation: 5 %/year 4 . Atlantic Bank Burkina is assuming conservative discount rates between 5 % and 10 % for PV systems [71,116]. Based on above assumptions the PV system costs can be defined by the following equation: (cid:2)(cid:24) %&\u2019( = (1 + 0.02 \u2217 .1 ) /(cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) \u2217 (cid:2)(cid:24) \"01(cid:8)2 + (cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) \u2217 345 \"01(cid:8)2 + \u2211 378 91:2 \u2217 378 \"01(cid:8)2 ;< => =? ;<@ (1 \u2212 0.05) ;\u2217C(cid:5) D ( Eq. 3 ) Where: - (cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) : Estimated PV system peak capacity E#F \" G depending on solar radiation and consumption profile of the community - 378_IJKL is the total battery array size (cid:13)#$\u210e(cid:17) optimised per each location - (cid:2)(cid:24)_MNJ(cid:19)L is the module price E(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)/#F \" G - 345_MNJ(cid:19)L is the BOS price E(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)/#F \" G - 378_MNJ(cid:19)L is the module price (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)/#$\u210e(cid:17) - N1 lifetime (cid:13)PLQNI(cid:17) of the PV system - N2 lifetime (cid:13)PLQNI(cid:17) of the battery In a second step, the PV technology option is further processed to distinguish between PV minigrid ( (cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) > 15#$ \" ) and PV stand-alone systems ( (cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) < 15#$ \" ). 4 Influences the price of future battery replacements ",
        "56 7.1.4 Calculation of least-cost option for each settlement Grid extension might not be the most appropriate option for scattered population even at medium distance from the grid. We define a \u2018dynamic criterion\u2019 that favours grid connections where the population is concentrated and at a relatively short distance from the existing distribution lines (33 kV). When grid extension is not feasible, as determined by the \u2018dynamic criterion\u2019, off-grid solutions are assessed taking into account the specific electricity loads for each settlement. Grid extension is likely to be a viable alternative compared to decentralised systems in each settlement i when: (TUI(cid:3) VWWXY01(cid:18) ) 1 \u2217 (T7(cid:11) VWWXY01(cid:18) ) 1 > (TUI(cid:3) Y01(cid:18) ) 1 \u2217 Z 1 ( Eq. 4 ) D: Distance from the rural community to the main grid (cid:13)#[(cid:17) T7(cid:11) VWWXY01(cid:18) : Estimated peak capacity E#F \" G TUI(cid:3) VWWXY01(cid:18) : Calculated cost of decentralised system E(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)/#F \" G TUI(cid:3) Y01(cid:18) : Cost of grid extension (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)/#[(cid:17) Grid extension costs in Sub-Saharan Africa can certainly reach 30,000 EUR/km or more [59]. In addition, as Burkina Faso experiences constant capacity shortage in the transmission system and power shortage in generation, the grid extension may trigger investments in the centralised power system that may more than double the costs of electrification [117]. The unit price for grid extension under this criterion has been set to a relatively high cost (40,000 EUR/km), which is realistic if compared to the field costs in Burkina Faso [30], [118]. Capacity costs estimation have been completed for each settlement in Burkina Faso for all competitive technologies (extension of the grid from the closest existing network, hydropower including the extension of a local grid from the closest permanent river section, off-grid PV system and stand-alone diesel generator). Based on the generation cost of each study\u2019s technology, the following formula defines the minimum cost for each geographic location: (cid:13)\\].]\\(cid:15)\\ %V9(cid:9)VWWXY01(cid:18) (cid:17) 1 = (cid:13)minimum (Diesel efgh , Hydro efgh , PV efgh )(cid:17) 1 ( Eq. 5 ) ",
        "57 8 Results 8.1 Current tendencies for grid extension In Burkina Faso, 95 % of the electricity is consumed in urban areas, while electricity needs in peri-urban and rural areas remain almost uncovered [71]. The national policy for electrification is dominated almost exclusively by slow grid extension coupled with the government subsidising fossil fuel electricity production. Still, a high proportion of the rural population is not connected to the grid even for communities located relatively close to the existing transmission lines. Around 1,500 non-electrified communities with a total of 2.5 million people are within 5 km of distribution lines (20 % of the total non- electrified settlements and 16 % of the total population). Figure 24 identifies the settlements within the country based on the current mode of electricity supply. Figure 24. Existing energy technology per community. Data source: SONABEL, FDE internal communication (2014). GIS processing and map: JRC [82]. The eligibility criteria for the selection of grid extension can be based on either social considerations, cost-effectiveness criteria or a combination of both. Burkina Faso policy prioritises grid extension when feasible accordingly to distance criterion [30]. The distance criterion to the grid is based on the assessment of the operating constraints of the electricity network and the analysis of options for power supply to settlements identified as priority candidates [30]. The grid extension approach does not take into consideration the needs of refurbishment of the existing grid. If refurbishment costs were taken into consideration [119], the picture would change dramatically hindering the grid extension option. According to the Energy Ministry feasibility study [30] and [47], SONABEL established the minimum criterion of extending the grid to communities located within 25 km from the nearest 33 kV line and to settlements with over 6,000 people as well as smaller ones ",
        "58 located along the transmission route (D<1 km). In 2008, a revised feasibility study [30] updated the minimum size of the settlements to be connected to 1,500 inhabitants. Figure 25 illustrates the location of the communities classified following a combination of size of communities (more than 6000, between 1,500 and 6,000, less than 1,500 inhabitants) and the minimum distance criteria along four corridors as in the feasibility study mentioned above. Figure 25. Distribution of communities according to size and the distance to the 33 kV line. Data source: [82,84,120,121]. GIS processing and map: JRC [82]. As illustrated in the cheese diagram in Figure 25, 77 % of the population in Burkina Faso still resides in rural areas. Only 1 % of the communities are located farther from the grid than 25 km and almost all of them retain a population of fewer than 6,000, the size limit for urban settlement in Burkina Faso. Most of the large communities are located along a 5 km corridor from the existing or planned lines. 8.2 Least-cost technology according to dynamic criterion Figure 26 shows the geographical distribution of the least-cost technology when using the dynamic criterion (described in detail in section 7) including electricity loads per settlement, and the distance of load centres to grid. ",
        "59 Figure 26. Least-cost electricity option for Burkina Faso Source: Moner-Girona et al. [82]. Our least-cost spatial planning results show a clear preference for decentralised RE technologies when low electricity demand does not justify the high investments of grid extension. These results are along the same lines as other studies, i.e. the World Bank, PDF EUEI, REN21 [122\u2013124]. The techno-economic results under a universal electricity access target suggest distributed generation options to 60 % of the population living in non-electrified communities. The results show the same tendency even under conservative assumptions with higher module PV prices and lower grid extension costs (see section 8.2.1). Although in our previous continental level studies hydropower was mapped as the optimal electricity source in Burkina Faso [100] in some regions close to southern river tributaries of the Black Volta and Komoe River (south-west) and Pendjari River (south- east), there were no settlements that were located within an economically feasible distance. As a result, due to the geographic, hydro-geographic and climatic conditions of the country [125], the run-of-the-river based small or mini hydropower electricity generation does not seem to be competitive nor an optimal electricity source for remote communities in Burkina Faso. Figure 27 shows the comparative analysis of the two major distributed electricity generation options (diesel generator versus PV-minigrids) [100,126,127]. The map shows the difference in electricity costs (EUR/kWh) when comparing electricity generated by diesel generators (at diesel cost at 0.94 EUR/l) and PV mini-grids (module cost of 1 EUR/W p ). While the decrease of PV module prices have steadily favoured the PV based options in the last decade as the high oil prices prevailed, the sharp decrease of oil prices had the opposite effect. The price drop during 2014/16 in oil prices make the diesel option much more competitive than the presented model results suggest (2011 prices, with a range of 0.94-1.04 EUR/l between 2008-2016). As investment in electricity ",
        "60 generation assumes at least 5 years of operation, the most adequate approximation for the fuel cost would probably be a 5-year moving average price of the given fuel so the short-term fluctuation is excluded. The input parameters used for diesel in this study reflect these longer-term price trends. Figure 27. Least-cost electricity option: PV versus diesel generator potential Source: RE2nAF [127]. When applying the dynamic criterion, the results show that the national grid would cover 8.3 million people distributed in 2,300 communities (see Table XIII ). From the 2,300 communities that our model suggests, 620 are already electrified communities. Moreover, our total cost calculation is based on the assumption of providing electricity to all the communities with a 100 % coverage. This assumption takes into account that for the already electrified urban communities 46 % of population does not yet have access to electricity, so 54 % of the already electrified settlement will gain access to electricity.

The PV minigrid ( (cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) > 15#$ \" ) is a prime candidate to provide service to a population of over 7.2 million (for 4,948 small and medium-sized villages) and PV stand- alone systems ( (cid:11) (cid:6)(cid:10) < 15#$ \" ) for 115,000 people (0.7 % of the population). It should be stated that due to the absence of accurate demographic and geographical information for a highly dispersed population, our study does not included the calculations for the highly dispersed population. In those areas where population is highly dispersed, a PV stand- alone system might be considered the least-cost option solution. The average cost of electrification per inhabitant for grid and PV are 52 and 180 EUR/capita respectively. The total capital cost of connecting 15.6 million new customers in the baseline scenario is approximately EUR 1.7 billion ( Table XIII ). Due to the volatility of oil prices and the subsidising of fossil fuel electricity production, it becomes unsustainable for the Government to continue supporting fossil fuel electricity production to reach universal access to electricity [71]. For instance, in 2014, the subsidies that SONABEL and SONABHY received from the State for fuel were worth FCFA 28 billion (EUR 43 million) [5]. According to the International Monetary Fund [128], till 2013 Burkina Faso had subsidised almost EUR 200 millions of fossil-fuel, which would translate to bringing electricity through decentralised technologies to 1 million rural people. To face the critical power supply situation, SONABEL paid FCFA 28 billion (EUR 42 million) for the production of 235 GWh. 8.2.1 Sensitivity analysis a) Sensitivity analysis on electricity load profiles and demand projections Electricity load profiles We have performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how a variation in the load profile or a change in the electricity demand would influence the selection of the least-cost technology option in each settlement. The different load profiles investigated assuming universal electricity access are: - Household profile. The electricity load per settlement follows the assumption that households are the dominant customer group (current average household consumption is 40 kWh/year/capita). - Social profile. The electricity load per settlement is calculated assuming that the households are the dominating customer group and incorporating 10 % of total load due to social infrastructure. ",
        "62 - Productive profile. The electricity load per settlement is calculated incorporating productive uses and potential commercial activities (40 % of productive use, 10 % due to social infrastructure and 50 % to households). Figure 28. Solar radiation and consumption profiles Source : Moner-Girona et al. [82] Demand projections The total peak demand for each settlement is estimated by summing up all household and social infrastructure demands and a coincidence factor of 70 %. In order to investigate the effect of energy demand projections on least-cost rural electrification technologies two different electricity demand projections are investigated under the social load profile: - Universal electricity access scenario (reach universal electrification by 2030). The full coverage scenario assumes all households (in rural and urban areas) will be electrified over a 20-year period beginning in 2012 and ending in 2032. The increase in demand is applied only in non-electrified settlements (from no electricity consumption to 40kWh/year/capita). - High-energy demand scenario: The increase in total demand is due to an increase of electricity consumption from 40 to 110 kWh/year/capita in electrified settlements by 2032, and an increase from 0 to 40 kWh/year/capita for settlements without access to electricity. For population already living in electrified areas there is a distinction between rural and urban areas. Table XIV. Share of population covered by different technologies. Model results for the three different load profiles and the two different demand scenarios. Household load profile Social load profile Productive load profile Universal access scenario High energy- demand scenario PV stand-alone (%) 1 1 1 1 1 PV minigrid (%) 46 46 52 46 40 Grid extension (%) 53 53 47 53 59 ",
        "63 The sensitivity analysis shows that changing the load profile to productive use, increasing the share of day consumption, results in a slight shift from grid extension to distributed technologies. These findings indicate that an increase in productive activities favours the share of PV systems. At the same time moving from the universal access scenario towards a higher energy-demand scenario, increases the share of grid extension from 53 % to 59 %. Here we observe the modular nature of PV that can relatively easily adapt to an increase in per capita consumption or number of customers, giving priority to the modularly implementable off-grid solution. b) Sensitivity analysis on PV and diesel costs The analysis of the diesel cost parameters on its competitiveness for electricity production has been based on the 2008-2016 data of diesel price development in Burkina Faso from [72] and from global petrol prices [129]. Burkina Faso needs to import all fossil fuels, most of which come from trade partner countries that have lately experienced turbulent disruptions (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mali). Due to the energy security problems and to the high prevailing subsidies already funded, Burkina Faso is amongst the group of countries that did not follow the decreasing trend of oil prices in the national diesel prices. These prices stayed quite stable with the decrease between 2012 and 2016 below 5%. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis has shown negligible changes in settlements where diesel generators were potentially the most economic option for electricity generation (changing diesel costs from 0.94 to 1.04 EUR/l). Sensitivity analysis on the cost of PV technology suggests that lowering the cost of PV components would have a significant impact on reducing the costs of universal electrification: decreasing module cost from 1 to 0.8 EUR/W p reduced the total investment costs by almost 10 %. But taking into account the slow grid electrification progress in Burkina Faso, a large part of the population is not going to be connected in the near future: 7.9 million people (50 % of population) still live in non-electrified communities away from the 5 km corridor. Therefore, there is a big opportunity for a large proportion of these communities to get electricity from a different solution than that of grid extension. ",
        "64 9 Conclusions Burkina Faso highly depends on imported fossil fuels for the generation of electricity and has one of the highest costs of electricity production (0.21 EUR/kWh), compared to its neighbouring countries. Since 2010, the average cost of electricity is higher than its selling price. As a consequence, the State is granting SONABEL with yearly bridge subsidies . In 2015, the SONABEL balancing subsidy debts total up to CFAF 51 billion (EUR 78 million). If this situation persists, it will lead to the degradation of SONABEL\u2019s production facilities and to delays in rehabilitation and maintenance of the electrical networks. On top of that, the problem of low electrification rates is severe. Up to date government rural electrification policies are still based on the \u2018status quo\u2019 path of grid extension. Accordingly, Burkina Faso progress falls substantially short of what is required to attain the SE4ALL objectives by 2030 [130]. The results of the present study underline the need for a new national approach which will emphasise the opportunities for long-term sustainable options, and increase access to electricity on an accelerated timeline. While the existing plan gives poor prospects for the expansion of decentralised technologies, the results from a least-cost analysis indicate a preference for distributed renewable energy systems, even stronger when the low level of consumption does not justify the high investments of grid extension. The calculated additional decentralised options could potentially yield to annual emissions savings equal to 162,000 tons of CO 2 , using Burkina Faso\u2019s grid emission factor of 0.70 tCO 2 /MWh [131]. Taking into account the upfront investment needs and the related risks, the planning, regulation and authorisation capacities in Burkina Faso, the central grid extension option may not be feasible (as shown by the halted grid implementation of the last decade), giving priority to the modularly implementable off-grid solution. MEPRED Study by Ministry of Mines and Energy JRC Universal electricity access scenario COVERAGE 5.5 million people 15.6 million people 1,528 communities (21% of non-electrified communities) Electrified by interconnections 7,149 communities (100% of non-electrified communities) Electrified by interconnections and PV Technology: 100% grid Technology: 53 % communities by grid 47 % communities by PV COSTS EUR 200 million + EUR 1,743 million Refurbishment & production (costs over 20 years NOT included) Cumulative investment (costs distributed over 20 years) + EUR 100 million network refurbishment [59] + 100 MW power plants refurbishment Production costs NOT included New network: EUR 435 million New PV installed: EUR 1 300 million 36 EUR/inhabitant + production costs 111 EUR/inhabitant (cost in 20 years) Source : JRC with the interpolation from MEPRED [30] 1 EUR=656 FCFA (2016) ",
        "65 The key costs figures compare the total investment cost calculated by our least-cost model for universal electricity access (EUR 1.7 billion) to the estimations of the Energy Ministry study [30], where 5.5 million people (1,528 additional communities) would be electrified by grid extension with a total investment cost of EUR 200 million. The grid extension figures do not include the costs of fossil fuel consumption at the generation sites, neither the capacity shortage in the transmission system, or energy shortage in generation. It should be noticed that the results of the MEPRED study correspond to a scenario with a national electricity access target of 45 % and a rural electricity access target of 36 %, without adding the 100 million EUR needed for the refurbishment of the existing network [59]). Our model results are based on the assumption of providing electricity to all the communities with a 100% coverage; including those living in already electrified settlements but without access to electricity (46 % of urban population and 98 % of rural population). It should be noted that the present study has an additional characterisitic compared to our previous work [132,133]. It considers energy-related geospatial information by taking into account the variation of electricity load for each location and considers the current electrification status and the rate of electrification (urban/rural). To our view this is important because it responds better to the status quo of the country and adapts to the modular nature of PV technology (with PV size per settlement ranging from 400 W p to 567 kW p ). 9.1 Recommendations and future developments CONCRETE AND UNIFIED ACTION PLAN FOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION Scattered plan A. Rural electrification achievements in Burkina Faso are very modest, still less than 5 % of the rural population have access to electricity. The rural electrification plan for Burkina Faso is scattered in several policies for electricity sector development. However, currently the Government is on the process of defining a concrete and single action plan like those existing in other Sub-Saharan countries, which successfully support rural electrification (e.g. Cape Verde, Kenya). The JRC spatial analysis tool presented in this report can be influential at an early development stage to increase the probability of achieving the national rural electrification goals. The objectives envisaged by the government are to reach a global 95% electricity access (50% in rural areas) and universal access to clean cooking solution in urban areas (65% in rural areas) by 2030. The Government also set a target of 50% renewable energy in the electric mix by 2030 (without biomass). B. Furthermore, most of the neighbouring countries from which Burkina imports electricity most of have experienced turbulent disruptions (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire).. Therefore, smaller local projects are expected to be more feasible than centralised planning in the long-term. C. Burkina Faso has to import all fossil fuels, mostly from countries under political instability (Ivory Coast). This raises energy security issues and considering the already high subsidies, it explains why Burkina Faso is amongst the few countries where national diesel prices did not follow the decreasing trend of oil prices. Stronger support institutions A. The institutional development must be considered when undertaking an assessment of the sustainability and risk factors of a proposed rural electrification planning. The Rural Electrification Fund (FDE) was developed with international institutions to manage their direct subsidies or concessional loan transfers. In the case of implementing a rural electrification plan with a high percentage of PV distributed technologies. FDE should become a fully-fledged financial institution due to the higher complexity of financing many smaller local projects which ",
        "66 requires higher installation costs of PV but lower running costs [122,134]. Following this trend, the FDE is being turned to a rural electrification agency; studies are being done for the creation of a Fund for the energy sector. In the same line, the national agency for renewable energy and energy efficiency (ANEREE) was launched in 2016. B. Burkina Faso should develop a clear renewable energy financing strategy capable of securing resources to cover the financial needs to implement the use of renewable energy technologies while gaining universal access to electricity [135,136]. Therefore, there is a need to coordinate the resources coming from a variety of institutions: international lenders, investment funds, energy operators and national and international markets. Specific literature on this topic implies a stronger consistency for renewable energy funds allowing a centralised management of the national or international subsidies [122,134,137]. C. The recent launch of the renewable energy agency (October 2016) will strengthen the development of a specific programme for renewable energy technologies at the national scale with involvement of the influential ECREEE (the renewable energy centre of the Economic Community of West African States). The rural electrification planning tool can help to revise the national priorities and support the coordination with other programmes [82]. The next stage of this study is to proceed with the discussion and consultation with main stakeholders of the results of the mapping and extension of the rural electrification master plan. STRONGER INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES This paper highlights the substantial photovoltaic potential in Burkina Faso and shows results that may increase the willingness of the government and international organisations to develop renewable energies in its territory. For the economic aspects, the paper shows one potential approach on how to reduce the marginal cost by the deployment of an additional 374 MW p of solar photovoltaic capacity in Burkina Faso. The optimisation of the least-cost technology option is based in the available local resources (small hydropower and solar PV), or imported fossil fuel resources (diesel generator or grid extension). The results strongly suggest an increase in the integration of renewable energy in the overall electricity supply and a decrease on the current dominance of fossil fuels. A. Currently, the common national policy for electrification is grid extension. The national portfolio might strongly consider more profitable projects such as mini-grids using local resources, as the economic burden to develop and maintain the national grid will be very high and not necessarily the least-cost option. Our results suggest up to 65% of the non-electrified settlements would be covered by decentralised technologies. B. The cumulative investment to reach universal access to electricity by 2030 is EUR 1.7 billion according to our model. However, defining the source of capital/funds extends the scope of the present study. Specific literature on this topic implies several financial and incentive schemes to support the deployment of decentralised energy technologies [122,134,137]. C. The diesel generator option has strongly decreased due to the high dependency on fuel imports and the increasing costs due to transportation. D. Due to the geographic, hydrogeographic and climatic conditions of the country [56] run-of-the-river hydropower electricity generation does not seem to be a feasible nor an optimal electricity source for communities in Burkina Faso. E. SONABEL studies indicate that wind resources are very low and hydropower potential is not high. Accordingly it has already recommended the use of solar resources (PV and thermal). but at the moment there is not a specific master plan for development at country level (apart from some general indication from ECOWAS) [4]. ",
        "67 IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE PLANNING TOOL The developed model resulted into a collaboration with the Africa-based research institution ECOWAS-ECREEE and the development of a similar tool (ECOWREX) [64]. Linking the Burkina Faso electrification plan more tightly for such tools could help attract more international support to the electrification projects of the country. In order to integrate the social and environmental aspects [138\u2013140] into our rural electrification planning tool the following cross-cutting aspects of the UN Sustainable Development Goals could also be considered: (i) identification of potential significant adverse impacts on the environment and resettlement issues (such as on rural-urban migration patterns. urbanisation and rural planning), (ii) roles and priorities of men and women in the electrification planning and possible mechanisms to ensure equal participation, (iii) links between electricity services and educational, health and productive sectors.
