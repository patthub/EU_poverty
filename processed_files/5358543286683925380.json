        "W E C A N O V E R C O M E U N D E R N U T R I T I O N : M A L I C A S E S T U D Y 2 In Mali, a child dies every ten minutes due to malnutrition 1 . Beyond the human consequences, undernutrition perpetuates the cycle of poverty and hinders the country\u2019s economic growth. It leads to sig- nificant health costs, poor cognitive functions and loss in productivity. These factors undermine the populations\u2019 resilience to climate, eco- nomic and security shocks, which Malians have painfully confronted during recent years. Investing in nutrition globally is sustainable and one of the most cost-effective investments. In Mali, evidence indicates that for every dollar spent on scaling up nutrition-specific interventions, there is an economic return of US$ 11 2 . The government of Mali acknowledges that. It made clear its commitment by joining the SUN 3 movement in 2011 and by launching a National Nutrition Policy and a costed Multisectoral Nutrition Action Plan that proposes a holistic approach to tackle malnutrition. The resilience agenda enhanced through the Global Alliance for Re- silience (AGIR) 4 , to which Mali has subscribed, reinforces this multi- sectoral dimension whilst focusing more interventions on vulnerable groups within the population (mothers and young children). The aim is to tackle the root causes of food and nutrition insecurity underlaid by demographic pressure, climate change and exacerbated by the 2011-2012 political crisis. In this complex and fragile context, the humanitarian and develop- ment teams of the European Union (EU) work in a concerted manner in close collaboration with government services, local authorities and civil society at all levels. For the last 10 years, the EU has supported Mali to develop its institutional capacity and effectively implement nutrition-specific and sensitive programmes across various sectors. A greater mobilisation needed to reverse trends In 2015, the national prevalence of stunting was 30.4% 6 , reflect - ing a critical situation according to WHO 7 . In the aftermath, of the 2011-2012 events, the rate of stunting reduction has slowed down and is now too little (1.11%) with respect to the population increase (+3% annually). Today, approximately 900,0000 children under 5 are stunted. According to projections, this will increase to about 1.1 million in 2025. A significant mobilisation from all parties along with additional resources are required to reverse these trends. Nutrition: Key pillar and objective of resilience building Cover page photo by: EU Delegation Mali - C\u00e9line Lhoste. Children who suffer from chronic malnutrition fail to grow to their full genetic potential, both mentally and physically. It significantly increases the likelihood of premature death, and those that survive are prone to ill health and are less able to contribute to an active and productive life. The condition is measured by stunting \u2013shortness in height compared to others of the same age group\u2013 which manifests itself in the early life cycle of children, and the effects of which are irreversible.

Various forms of undernutrition reflecting combined forms of deprivation faced by infant and young children Besides stunting, undernutrition manifests itself in many forms al- most always associated with micronutrient deficiency. Anaemia, mainly related to iron deficiency and parasitic diseases, affects 81.6% of children (6 to 59 months) and 51.4% of pregnant women 7 . Zinc and vitamin A deficiency are widespread but poorly documented. Acute malnutrition has been for many years above the alert threshold (10%) 8 . Every year, about 700,000 children under five are affected by acute under-nutrition including 180,000 facing its most severe form, being at high risk of mortality. Inappropriate feeding and care practices for young children \u2022 Exclusive breastfeeding from 0 to 5 months: 32.6% 9 . \u2022 6-23 months with Minimum Acceptable Diet: 3.3% 10 . \u2022 6-23 months with Minimum Dietary Diversity: 13.5% 11 . \u2022 Complete vaccine coverage: 20.2% 12 . \u2022 Treatment of diarrhoea with ORS 13 and Zinc: 2.3% 14 . The first two years of child\u2019s life are critical for his/her mental and physiological development. Deprivations during this period may cause damage that can last a lifetime. A 2014 study 15 highlights that 38.5% of children under 2 in Mali suffers from monetary poverty combined with multiple deprivations (health, water sanitation, food, protection, etc.) 16 . Tackling these deeply rooted social and economi- cal causes requires an approach that is both holistic and long-term. Widespread poverty and high vulnerability to a variety of shocks Stunting prevalence (from 46.4% to 42.4%) is twice higher in the three lowest quintiles than in the wealthiest quintile (21.2%) 17 . Pov- erty prevents the majority of Malians accessing diversified food and essential basic services such as health, which directly impacts on their nutritional status. In 2014, income poverty affected 52.8% and 47.6% of inhabitants in rural and urban zones respectively. With one of the highest population growth rates worldwide, Mali is go- ing through a major social transformation. An increasing number of youth are landless and unemployed. They have low productive capacities and are highly dependent on erratic labour and food mar- kets for survival. It is estimated that one Malian out of five is food insecure. This situation worsens with the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, such as drought, floods, locust invasion, mar - ket disruption and conflicts. In the last four years, the combination of several shocks has resulted in half of the population of the north- ern regions being critically food insecure and requiring large-scale assistance to avoid further destabilisation of the area. The situation got even more acute as insecurity undermined the humanitarian response and jeopardised the ability to deliver basic services to the population. In 2016, the situation still remains precarious with the double challenge to respond to massive immediate food and nutri- tion needs and to build resilience in the long-run. Precarious social and health conditions of women The education level attained by mothers and the nutritional sta- tus of their children are closely correlated. Stunting prevalence is twice higher (40.1%) for children with mothers with no education than for children with mothers having reached secondary educa- tion (21.2%) 18 . Social conditions of mothers \u2022 Women literacy: 24.6%. \u2022 Women giving birth before 18 years old: 36.5% 19 . \u2022 Fertility rate: average of 6 children per woman 20 . \u2022 Prevalence of excision: 82.7% 21 . Similarly, close birth spacing increases likelihoods of undernutri- tion 22 and poor and irregular contact between health services and pregnant and lactating mothers reduces the opportunities to en- sure adequate micronutrients supplementation and to communi- cate messages on childcare and feeding practices. In rural areas, only a third of pregnant women have the recommended four pre- natal visits 23 . Lastly, although women actively participate to the household econo- my they rarely have control over resources (such as land and house- hold budget) and too few of them are involved in community deci- sions. This limits their empowerment and ability to implement good child care and feeding practices and may affect their children\u2019s nutri - tional status.

        "W E C A N O V E R C O M E U N D E R N U T R I T I O N : M A L I C A S E S T U D Y 4 Mali\u2019s commitment to overcome undernutrition The government is committed to reduce the prevalence of stunting by two thirds by 2021 25 . Reaching this ambitious target will require tremendous efforts and synergies of action. A political momentum on nutrition to be consolidated The newly launched Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Development (CREDD 26 ) (2016-2018) promotes cross-sectoral strategies and identifies the targeting of the poorest as a common theme of governments action. Amongst other objec- tives, it proposes to guarantee food security for all, improve the nutritional status of the most vulnerable and to pursue gender eq- uity measures. This general framework confirms the government\u2019s ambition to tackle food and nutrition insecurity and enhance the resilience of the most vulnerable population. Indeed, during the course of the past 5 years, much progress has been made to address undernutrition in Mali. After organising a Na - tional Nutrition forum in 2010, Mali joined the international SUN (Scaling up Nutrition) movement in 2011 reinforcing its political commitment to nutrition. In 2013 a new National Nutrition Policy (PNN 27 ) was adopted based upon extensive consultations across sectors involving numerous Ministries. This policy includes nutrition-specific strategies such as monitoring child growth and development, improving infant and young child feeding practices, and reducing micronutrient deficiencies imple - mented. The PNN also proposes to integrate nutrition objectives in development programmes of other sectors. This has been achieved through a revision of the National Social Protection Policy that will soon be adopted and with the National Food Security and Nutrition Policy that is under development. Set up of multisectoral coordination platforms for nutrition To ensure the coordination of the National Nutrition Policy and to promote the involvement of the many sectors that can contribute to nutrition, two main bodies have been cre- ated in 2014: (i) the National Nutrition Council involving 17 ministerial departments, the high council of local authori- ties, the private sector and civil society; and (ii) an Inter-sec- toral Technical Committee (CTIN). A major challenge however, is the lack of dedicated resourc- es to ensure effective coordination. Consequently a Nutrition Coordination Cell imbedded in the Ministry of Health and Hygiene has been created (2015) and is in the process of becoming functional. A fair return to investment The Multisectoral Action on Nutrition (PAMN) that operationalises the PNN for the period 2014-2018 was costed in 2014, identifying an annu- al average budget requirement of US$121 million. A parallel World Bank study published the same year highlighted that the countrywide scale up of nutrition specific activities alone would represent an investment of US$85 million annually. The study estimated that such an invest- ment would save about 15,000 lives, 1.2 million DALE 28 , prevent 60,000 stunting cases and add US$42 million to the national GDP every year. Progress on nutrition-specific actions that need to be reinforced by a multisectoral approach and more sustainable funding In the last 5 years, considerable progress has been achieved through nutrition-specific activities integrated within health programmes: 75% of expected caseload of children with severe acute malnutrition have received treatment; 93% of children from 6 to 59 months have received Vitamin A supplementation; 96.7% of households have consumed io- dised salt. However, Mali remains financially dependent on external aid from technical and financial partners, notably the EU, and in the long run needs to find more sustaina - ble means. Furthermore, much needs to be done to improve feeding practices and childcare (notably for the treatment and prevention of diarrhoea and malaria) and to promote a better integration of nutrition in other sectors (e.g.: agricul- ture, social protection, water and sanitation, education, etc.). AGIR: A new opportunity to reinforce the multi-sectoral approach and prioritise resources for the most vulnerable Committed to the \u201cZero Hunger\u201d target within the next 20 years, Mali was one of the first countries within the region to engage in the Global Alliance for Resilience (AGIR), which represents a new opportunity to develop a multi-sectoral approach to nutrition-based resilience building. Mali elaborated its National Resilience Priorities (NRP) in 2015 with the aim to structurally and sustainably reduce food and nutrition vulnerability by 2035. Nutrition is both a pillar and an objective of NRPs: the four pillars of resilience should together contribute to reduce malnutrition. This framework facilitates synergies between policies and programmes of different sectors that contribute to reduce food and nutrition in - security. Mali now urgently needs to mobilise the required resourc- es to scale up actions on the ground and to reinforce the steering groups of actors around priorities that have been set. Prioritise resources in the most vulnerable zones An exercise was carried out in 2014 in the framework of AGIR to rank communes by their degree of vulnerability. It led to a mapping of findings for each of the pillars of resilience. A map of multidimensional vulnerability (refer to page 3) was then compiled combining vulnerability to various shocks and aggravating factors that should be used to prioritise alloca- tion of resources in the most vulnerable areas of the country. 24 General objective of the National Nutrition Policy. 25 Commitment of the National Nutrition Policy.

The EU in Mali: A holistic approach at all levels to prevent undernutrition and support resilience building of the most vulnerable The EU in Mali has committed to a long-term approach to nutri- tion-sensitive food security which is now reinforced with the resil- ience agenda. Since 2007, the EU committed about \u20ac275 million to the food security and nutrition sector in Mali (including small- scale agriculture projects and emergency aid) and an additional \u20ac30 million to nutrition-sensitive water, hygiene and sanitation pro- grammes. In parallel, \u20ac111 million have been devoted to support the competiveness of the agricultural sector. Nutrition in food security and rural development programmes The EU in Mali has been working for many years in the field of food and nutrition security through European Development Funds (EDF), thematic lines and humanitarian funds. Nutrition, Resilience and Gender: The EU steering role in Mali Between 2007 and 2015, the PASA 29 programmes and food facility have enabled the implementation of a succession of food and nutrition security programmes targeting the most vul- nerable population (mainly the poorest, women and children). Most of these programmes applied a nutrition lens to food security. This implies favouring livelihoods opportunities and home-based production for women while taking into account their workload and protecting their ability to ensure childcare. Interventions also ensured that women played a critical role in communities\u2019 activities and decisions, and provided them and their children access to child health care, micronutrients supplementation and a diversified diet. These approaches have resulted in models of intervention that later fed in to the national resilience agenda. Under the 11 th EDF (2015-2020), the EU reiterates its full support to \u2018Rural development, food and nutrition security\u2019 which now represents a focal sector. The EU aims to support a strengthened agriculture sector with the goal of improving food and nutrition security through institutional support to the CSA 30 and concerned ministries and the implemen- tation of projects focused on building resilient communities, house- holds and individuals. Actions aimed at protecting the environment, improving the management of natural resources and adaptation to climate change strengthen this approach. Response to acute and immediate needs of the population In the last 10 years, the humanitarian service of the EU has al- located \u20ac96 million in response to food and nutrition crises. This response has ensured the coverage of immediate needs through emergency food assistance, mainly in the North, and nutrition ther- apeutic feeding programmes countrywide. In parallel, the EU pursues political dialogue and supports the gov- ernment in its reform of the national food crises management sys- tem and the adoption and implementation of its sectoral policies addressing root causes of food and nutrition security. A joint humanitarian and development framework to build long-term resilience The resilience approach enabled a better articulation between hu- manitarian and development programmes based on a common sit- uation analysis and complementary actions through multifaceted interventions and emergency or productive safety net schemes ac- cording to the contexts. A common implementation framework for activities aimed at building resilience toward food and nutrition in- security was elaborated and led to the launch of a joint programme in the North of the country. The approach is strengthened by the creation of the EU Trust Fund (EUTF) for West Africa in 2015, in which the resilience component will enable to develop new programmes in Mali. 29 Programme d\u2019Appui \u00e0 la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Alimentation (food security support programme). 30 Commissariat \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire.

        "W E C A N O V E R C O M E U N D E R N U T R I T I O N : M A L I C A S E S T U D Y 6 In line with the Commission\u2019s Action Plan for Nutrition, the EU focus- es on 3 strategic priorities: Strategic Priority 1: Mobilisation, political commitment and governance The EU mobilises actors around nutrition through its four focal sec- tors (policy and economic governance; rural development and food security; and infrastructure and education). Through a sub-conti- nental nutrition programme (ANSP 31 ) funded by the EU and imple- mented by Unicef, Mali benefitted from important institutional sup - port. It contributed to the adoption of the PNN and its action plan, the implementation of the IYCF 32 strategy at community level and to capacity building (including training of nutrition focal points in different sectors). The partnership also supported the piloting of multisectoral coor- dination platforms for nutrition at local level. Through its budget support, the EU also facilitates enhanced governance of food and nutrition security. Strategic Priority 2: Scaling up of actions at national level Actions to improve nutrition and build resilience in areas affected by food and nutrition crises are intensified at sub-national level and concern several sectors: 3 Resilience building in northern regions: Several projects are implemented to strengthen the resilience of communities and local governance, in line with National Resilience priorities. Multifaceted approach for Resilience building in the North Through the LRRD 33 approach between its humanitarian and development services, the EU is allocating \u20ac35 million (EUTF and EDF/PRORESA) for the period 2016-2020 to fund inno - vative nutrition-sensitive resilience building interventions in the Northern Regions of Mali. Funding will be allocated to a consortia of NGOs selected for their technical knowledge, their capacity to work in fragile and unpredictable environ- ments and who operate in strong partnership with local au- thorities and communities. The interventions will be context specific, will combine the four pillars of AGIR and will focus on the most vulnerable households. Activities will contribute and complement na- tional programmes. A common logical framework and a ro- bust monitoring and evaluation framework will be set up in partnership with a research institute to measure the effects on nutrition and resilience building in this fragile context. 3 Agriculture: The EU supports nutrition-sensitive agricultural programmes such as IRRIGAR (2014-2019) (\u20ac27.7 million) implemented by GIZ/KFW 34 , whose objectives are aligned with the National Small Scale Irrigation Programme. The EU also considers enhancing the nutrition-sensitivity of value-chains such as the fish value chain. Nutrition-sensitive programme - IRRIGAR (2014-2019) The action targets: i) the mitigation of potential negative im- pacts on nutrition of small scale irrigation (such as water-borne diseases, and ensuring a balance between woman workload and child care); ii) the enhancement of nutrition gains through increased income, improved diets and a gender-sensitive ap- proach; and iii) monitoring of results using DDS 35 and anthro- pometric indicators. 3 Water, hygiene and sanitation: The EU promotes at govern- ment-level nutrition-sensitive water and sanitation such as through the PACTEA 2 36 (2013-2017) (\u20ac30 million), a pro- gramme jointly funded by the EU and the Malian State to support local and regional authorities. 3 Health and treatment of acute malnutrition: Since 2012, the EU funds have enabled a significant scaling up of nutrition therapeutic services countrywide through 1,300 health cen- tres. By strengthening health services, new opportunities to prevent undernutrition through health sensitive interventions have emerged. Prevention and integrated management of acute malnutrition in the health system In 2015, more than 130,000 children affected by SAM 37 (i.e. 72% of the estimated number of children affected) were treated through NGOs and the United Nations thanks to EU funding. These services are partly integrated within the na- tional health system, which provides most of the required staff (although the supplies and financial means are still very much reliant on external aid). Synergies of action between health and nutrition-specific activities are encouraged to foster prevention and minimise costs: for example combining vaccination or malaria chem- oprophylaxis campaigns with screening/referrals of acute malnutrition. 31 ANSP: Africa Nutrition Security Partnership (2011-2015). 32 IYCF: Infant and Young Child Feeding. 33 Linking Relief Recovery and Development. 34 The German Agency for International cooperation (GIZ) and the public Bank for development (KFW) (German financial cooperation). 35 DDS: Dietary Diversity Score. 36 PACTEA: Programme d\u2019Appui aux Collectivit\u00e9s Territoriales pour l\u2019Eau Potable et l\u2019Assainissement (Programme Support to local authorities for drinking water and sanitation). 37 SAM: Severe Acute Malnutrition.

The EU and its partners collaborate with the government\u2019s Jigisimejiri programme and the World Bank on the identification of the most vulnerable households and contributes to the establishment and maintenance of a unified social register (national database). Ultimately the aim is that the poorest and most vulnerable Malians should benefit from well-managed national social protection programmes. Specif- ically in the North, EU humanitarian funds support access to free health services (emergency policy related to the crisis) and education. 3 Prevention and management of Food and Nutrition Crisis: In parallel to the above-mentioned institutional reform, every year, the EU substantially contributes to the national food se- curity response plan through different aid modalities. It also supports the functioning of the Early Warning System at local and central levels. Strategic Priority 3: Strengthening the expertise and the knowledge-base The EU provides supports to strengthen national expertise and ca- pacity in the food security and nutrition sector. The ANSP programme provided nutrition training (including the creation of a Master\u2019s course on nutrition in public health) and supported the revision of curricula of health and agricultural students integrating nutrition into the curricula. The EU contributes to the funding of SMART nutrition- al surveys 38 and funds nutrition-sensitive projects in Mali that pay particular attention to generating evidence of their impact (see box). The EU and the World Bank are carrying out a study of targeting in Gao in partnership with two research centres to improve knowledge on targeting and contribute to the development of a Unified Social Register. In the past, several studies (causal analysis, HEA 39 , Cost of Diet, anthropometric studies) were funded to better understand livelihoods, the economic determinants of malnutrition and to im- prove the national early warning system. Using and collecting evidence of improved nutrition through the PASA projects Nutrition Causal Analyses were funded under the PASA 4 and PASA 5 projects in order to better address the deter- minants of undernutrition (in particular food, income and behaviour-related). The objectives of PASA Mali 5 were to reduce food and nutrition insecurity amongst children under the age of two and women of reproductive age and, specif- ically, improve their diets. The Dietary Diversity Scores were used to measure the achievements of these food security projects. Their M&E sys- tem was designed to determine the actions with the greatest potential for improving the quality of diet and the nutrition status of the target groups according to the contexts.
