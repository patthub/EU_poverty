        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 1 1 Introduction 1.1 Background The present report has been prepared for Task 1: \u201cAnnual Synthesis\u201d of the service \u201cESF Performance and Thematic Reports\u201d. It provides a summary of monitoring information reported by Member States in their Annual Implementation Reports as delivered until September 6th, 2017. This reporting cycle covers 2016, and aggregates 2014-2016 implementation data and information. Annual reporting follows the 'intervention logic' adopted in Operational Programmes (OPs). The definition of OPs starts with the identification of development needs and the changes the programme is intended to bring about to meet specific objectives addressing these needs. Each programme must set 'specific objectives' and the related expected results that are intended to be achieved while taking into account the policy needs and characteristics of the area to which it relates. Expenditure, output and result indicators have to be monitored by the Managing Authorities (MAs) and reported upon in the framework of the Annual Implementation Report. This report provides input for a Strategic Report. This Strategic Report shall be transmitted to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions (Article 53(1)). The report shall be based on the annual implementation reports of the Member States, the progress reports delivered in 2017 as well as a synthesis of the findings of available evaluations of programmes.

This qualitative information was analysed in a structured way and used to complement and contextualise the quantitative findings. Achievements towards Performance Framework \u2022An overview of the progress towards the milestones and targets of the performance framework. Contribution to EU policy objecctives \u2022An analysis of the contribution to the main EU policy objectives. The assessment of the contribution of the ESF and YEI to these objectives is based on the monitoring data in the AIR 201, further complemented by the progress reports submitted by Member States in 2017 and the preliminary evaluation findings available. Specific actions undertaken by MA \u2022The progress reports, and in some cases AIR, also report on specific actions undertaken on a number of areas required by the Common Provisions Regulation and ESF Regulation. These specific actions have also been analysed in a structured way and reported upon in chapter 8. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 2 1.2 Methodology This report is based on a total of 187 Annual implementation reports, collected until 6 September 2017. Five of these reports were considered as non-admissible by the EC, while another 72 were considered admissible 1 . The table below displays figures on AIRs broken down by MS and aggregated by approval status. Table 1.1 Number of AIRs by status MS Total no OP Sent, no EC appraisal yet AIRs non Admissible AIRs Returned for modification AIRs Admissible Accepted by EC AT 1 1 BE 4 2 2 BG 3 1 2 CY 1 1 CZ 3 2 1 DE 17 2 7 6 2 DK 1 1 EE 1 1 ES 23 23 FI 2 1 1 FR 33 3 14 16 GR 17 16 1 HR 1 1 HU 5 1 2 2 IE 1 1 IT 29 1 7 14 7 LT 1 1 LU 1 1 LV 1 1 MT 1 1 NL 1 1 PL 17 3 14 PT 10 5 4 1 RO 2 2 SE 2 1 1 SI 1 1 SK 2 2 UK 6 1 1 4 EU 28 187 4 5 69 72 37 Source: SFC2014, AIR 2016 by September 6, 2017 2 In order to prepare this year\u2019s synthesis report of AIRs, different methodological steps were undertaken, as follows: 1. First of all, data was collected from all OPs and AIRs submitted through SFC until September 6th, 2017. Data was exported from SFC2014 by the EC IT service, including information on (1) programme architecture (MS; CCI; PAx; IP; type of region); (2) financial tables (Table 6 and 7 in Section 3.4 of the AIR), common output and result indicator tables (table 2A and 4A in section 3.2 of the AIR), YEI result indicators (Table 2B), programme specific output and result indicator tables (table 2C and table 4B in Section 3.2 of the AIR) and performance framework (table 28 of the OP). Furthermore, 1 This synthesis report aggregates all AIR received, also when considered not-admissible. This methodology was also followed in the 2016 synthesis (on the basis of AIR 2015). 2 As per the latest SFC extraction at the time of finalising the report (22 November 2017), only 3 AIR were sent and awaiting appraisal, 1 non-admissible, 30 returned for modification, 13 admissable, and a total of 140 were accepted by the EC. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 3 the free text provided by MS in their own language was extracted separately for a qualitative analysis. 2. Secondly, an assessment was carried out on the extracted data (addressing missing values, \u2019zero\u2019 values, extreme values, coherence between output and result values, unit costs, identification of measurement of units) by defining \u2019alert\u2019 and \u2019remedy\u2018 rules for (1) the detection of trivial errors (gaps, inconsistencies and format errors) and for (2) for the detection of performance peculiarities (under- or over performance, etc.) in the form of a set of thresholds. Annex I reports a number of possible quickfixes that the consultant team recommends based on these tests, while Annex II/III presents in more detail where inconsistencies were identified. Where necessary for aggregation, data was corrected or manipulated (e.g. in case percentages needed to be recalculated to absolute values). In order to allow comparison at EU level and further aggregation and analysis, some of the data was further screened and categorised. In particular, programme specific output and results indicators were labelled according to a standard set of categories. 3. Thirdly, an analysis was made of the data collected by: aggregating financial, output and result indicators; measuring progress in target achievement; calculating success rates of individuals supported; calculating costs per output and result; benchmarking with the EU average, analysis of outliers, categories of qualitative information in AIR; and also conducting a socio economic context analysis, and ESF contribution analysis. 4. Finally, the main findings are synthesised into this comprehensive report. The values reported refer to the data reported by MS in their AIR, as submitted by September 6, 2017 . To compare ongoing validity of the data reported, an additional check was conducted on the AIR versions submitted by November 22, 2017. These updated data are reported exclusively in footnotes to the report. All other values reported in the text and tables of the main text of the report refer to the AIR versions of September 6, 2017.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 4 2 Ex ante conditionality on statistical systems and result indicators In order to strengthen the result orientation of ESI funds and to create incentives for Member States that will ensure the effective progress towards the attainment of Europe 2020 objectives and targets through cohesion policy, the Common Provision Regulation defines a number of ex ante conditionalities that MS and MA must meet in order to qualify for support from the European Structural Funds. Section 2.1 further explores the definition and requirements of ex ante conditionalities in the CPR. Subsequently, section 2.2 explores to what extent MS have been able to meet these requirements in the first years of implementation. 2.1 Ex ante conditionalities in the CPR Ex ante conditionalities are key to ensuring that all institutional and strategic policy arrangements are in place for effective investment and consist of thematic and general conditionalities. Thematic ex ante conditionalities include requirements such as the existence of personalised labour market services or the existence of a policy framework for poverty reduction. General ex ante conditionalities apply to all programmes and consist of requirements on procurement or the use of reliable statistics, for instance (conditionality 7). Through a process of self-assessment by MS and subsequent assessment and approval by the EC, applicable ex ante conditionalities are selected and included in every OP. As General Ex Ante Conditionality 7 (GEAC7) applies to all programmes, all OP must indicate whether the programme already fulfils this requirement. In order to allow monitoring of the implementation of the required ex ante conditionalities, CPR Article 19(2) requires MS to report on the actions to be taken, the bodies responsible and the timetable for implementation. This report assesses the reporting by MS on general ex ante conditionality 7, which sets requirements on the statistical system and result indicators in place. More specifically, this ex ante conditionality requires MS to have the statistical basis in place to undertake evaluations to assess the effectiveness and impact of the programmes 3 . This section thus analyses the extent to which MS report on the fulfilment of general ex ante conditionality 7 in AIR2015. Since all ex ante conditionalities need to be fulfilled the latest by the end of 2016, information provided in AIR2014 and 2015 served as an important opportunity to spot possible delays in implementation and take targeted action in 2016. The reporting in AIR2016 now provides a final overview of the fulfilment of ex ante conditionalities. 2.2 Fulfilment of requirements on statistical systems and result indicators General ex-ante conditionality 7 sets a number of detailed sub-criteria for (statistical) data collection and result indicators. This is to allow for monitoring progress, undertaking evaluations and learning about the more effective actions. All sub-criteria defined should be finalised by the end of 2016, and are summarised in the figure below. 3 Based on part II of Annex XI in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 December 2013, O.J., L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 320 ",

Table 2.1 below lists all the actions required to fulfil the sub-criteria that were not fulfilled at the time of finalising the partnership agreements. Note that where AIR of MS report on multi- fund OP, the ex-ante conditionalities can also refer to actions that are not necessarily related to ESF implementation. \u2022Arrangements for timely collection and aggregation of statistical data with the following elements are in place: the identification of sources and mechanisms to ensure statistical validation. 7.1 \u2022Arrangements for timely collection and aggregation of statistical data with the following elements are in place: arrangements for publication and public availability of aggregated data. 7.2 \u2022An effective system of result indicators including: the selection of result indicators for each programme providing information on what motivates the selection of policy actions financed by the programme 7.3 \u2022An effective system of result indicators including: the establishment of targets for these indicators. 7.4 \u2022An effective system of result indicators including: the consistency of each indicator with the following requisites: robustness and statistical validation, clarity of normative interpretation, responsiveness to policy, timely collection of data. 7.5 \u2022Procedures in place to ensure that all operations financed by the programme adopt an effective system of indicators. 7.6 ",

The best illustration of the considerable efforts made over the last year, is the addition of 1 373 targets to result indicators; as a result, currently 88.7% of programme specific now have a target. Though a large improvement has been made across the EU in comparison to last year, DE, FR, GR, HU and UK still leave criteria unfulfilled. These cases are further assessed below. In DE, there is one instance where an effective system of result indicators, including targets set is reported as unfulfilled. However, a closer look suggests that the progress is simply not reported in the AIR 2016. There is only one instance where a criterion is left unfulfilled (Niedersachsen \u2013 2014DE16M2OP001), and the deadline for the planned actions taken is December 2015. The AIR itself reports that in January 2016 the EC had already confirmed that the OP had met all the criteria. Moreover, it can also be objectively verified that all relevant programme specific indicators in this OP do have a target; as such, the issue seems to have been resolved, but not reported. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 7 In FR, issues have been reported in 5 regional OP in mainland France, requiring improvements to the reliability of target values 4 . The AIR of the Champagne OP, reports that the necessary decisions have been taken by the end of 2016, but that revisions of result targets are planned to be implemented in early 2017. In Auvergne, all necessary actions to adjust targets have been completed on time, so it is unclear why the criterion itself is still reported to be unfulfilled. In Languedoc-Roussillon, the final targets will be confirmed once the regional strategy is in place, and it is known in which regions exactly the operation will take place. Initially, it was planned to have this decided in the course of 2015, but no updates have been reported by the end of 2016. In Provence-Alpes \u2013 C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, revisions to the target values were planned on the basis of new data to be made available by the regional governments. However, no updates or results of such activities have been reported by the end of 2016. In Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es et Garonne, the criteria 7.1/7.2 and 7.6 are reported to be unfulfilled. Based on an ex-ante evaluation of financial instruments by the end of 2016, more reliable estimates were made of the foreseen impacts; as a result, targets could be revised in the course of 2017. The regional OP has set a new deadline by the end of 2017 to conclude the final activities. In GR, unfulfilled criteria are reported for the Southern Aegean Sea OP, where the issue of effective system of result indicators (7.4) depended on an updating of the targets based on changed price levels. While the AIR reports that the activities have not been concluded by the deadline of December 2016, it also reports that it has been concluded successfully and confirmed by the EC in the first half of 2017. For the Greek TA OP a range of different general ex-ante conditionalities were unfulfilled by the end of 2016 (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6). However, the results of all actions have been formally confirmed and deemed acceptable by mid-July; as such these can be considered completed as well. HU also reports several unfulfilled ex-ante conditionalities with regards to data quality in the Human Resource Development and Competitive Central Hungary OP. Both depend on defining data sources to be used for target setting, and subsequently to set such targets in line with the EU and national targets. Moreover, these need be verified by the Monitoring and evaluation task-force, set up for this purpose. Initially, a deadline had been set for these activities to be concluded by December 2014. After this deadline was reportedly not met, a new deadline of December 2016 had been confirmed. No reasons are provided on why the deadline of 2016 has not been set, neither has a new deadline been confirmed. For a number of specific indicators, the territorial scope still needs to be defined, which also has a direct effect on the target setting. Thirdly, activities are planned to set the baseline value in a number of education operations, based on additional surveys. Even though these activities are reported as pending, the AIR reports that these methodological activities have been completed (though no date has been provided). In the Public Administration and Public Service Development OP, a reported issue pertains to the available of data sources that allows a statistical validation of data for a future evaluation. Even though it is marked as not completed, the AIR reports that it had reported on these activities by formal letter to the EC by December 2016. The Economic Development and Innovation OP refers to the activities necessary for developing reliable data collection to support monitoring and evaluation. It requires integration employment information from the Employment Service statistics into the ESF monitoring system. Here, the data will be aggregated for the common indicators and program-specific indicators; it requires that for the various ESF OP in the country, a uniform methodology and definitions are agreed upon to ensure that the data collected is consistent throughout. The AIR reports that these activities have been successfully concluded before the deadline. For reasons not clarified however, the criteria are still marked as unfulfilled. Other unfulfilled criteria and follow-up actions in this OP refer to the ERDF operations in that OP and are not further assessed here. Finally, two instances of unfulfilled criteria are reported in UK (East Wales). The non- compliance refers to a missing target in a specific indicator. Initially, it was planned to establish a target on the bases of an impact evaluation in 2016. To do so, extension of the 4 2014FR16M0OP002, 2014FR16M0OP004, 2014FR16M0OP006, 2014FR16M0OP007,2014FR16M0OP013 ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 8 deadline was requested and granted to February 2017. The criteria can be considered as completed, even though in the end no target value has been set; the indicator will be used for monitoring purposes only. It was agreed that progress would be adequately measured by the two existing result indicators, each of which has targets defined. 2.3 Overview The above shows that the implementation of general ex ante conditionality 7 has been completed by December 2016 in almost all MS. The exceptions to this observation were analysed in more detail above, and in most cases MS report that the underlying activities necessary to fulfil the ex-ante conditionality have been completed, and often have been confirmed by the EC to meet the requirements. Nonetheless, this chapter has also shown that in around half of the MS not all programme-specific indicators have been assigned a target. This is not necessarily a problem, and in most cases is in line with the Regulation; MS are required to have at least one target for one relevant indicator per specific objective, so do not have the obligation to formulate targets for all programme-specific indicators. When assessing the overall results, some follow-up remains necessary in HU. Here, a number of actions still need to be undertaken and confirmed; not coincidentally, this MS also has a relatively low share of targets assigned to result indicators (79%). ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 9 3 Overview of evaluations Ongoing evaluations of ESF programming are a crucial tool to monitor progress and adjust national or regional implementation of ESF in 2014-2020. The Common Provisions Regulation requires in article 56 that Managing Authorities adopt detailed evaluation plans. An analysis of these evaluation plans is provided in section 3.1. The CPR also requires MS to provide a synthesis of the findings in the evaluation conducted throughout the programming period. Section 3.2 provides additional details at the EU level of MS reporting towards this requirement. 3.1 Evaluation plans Evaluation plans represent an important element towards the result-oriented approach characterising the 2014-2020 programming period. These are to be submitted for approval to the monitoring committee no later than one year after the adoption of programme (article 114). The Commission Staff Working document on the 2016 Synthesis of Evaluation Results and Plans under the ESIF programme 2014-2020, indicates that by 30 June 2016, 128 ESF (including multi-fund) Evaluation Plans were submitted to the monitoring in Committees for assessment and approval, covering an estimated 75% of ESF resources. Some Spanish ESF Ops, Italian regional ESF Ops and the Dutch ESF OP did not submit an evaluation plan covering their ESF programmes by that time. Based on the evaluation plans available, the DG REGIO/EMPL Evaluation Helpdesk 5 made an inventory of the type, number and thematic coverage of the evaluations planned. Note that for multi-fund OP, evaluations may also cover non-ESF thematic areas. Below, the figure presents the distribution of all planned evaluations. Only a very limited number of evaluations were already planned in 2015, 115 evaluations in 2016, while a substantial number are foreseen to take place in the coming years. Figure 3.1 Overview planned evaluations over time Source: Evaluation Helpdesk (as received on 14 September 2017) Figure 3.1 differentiates the types of evaluation that are included in the various evaluation plans (ranging from evaluations assessing the implementation process, the progress, impact, and combinations of these types of evaluation). Some evaluations were labelled 5 The aim of the contract is to provide an \u201cEvaluation Helpdesk\u201d to the Commission that reviews the 2014-2020 evaluation plans, identifies evaluations undertaken by Managing Authorities in 2015-2019, reviews a sample of evaluations, and provides support to Member States in refining their evaluation plans and designing and managing evaluations. In addition, the Helpdesk provides structured information on the outcome of the reviews of evaluations to support the European Commission\u2019s syntheses of evaluation findings. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 10 as ongoing or not available. As indicated, one needs to consider that this figure also includes evaluations in multi-fund OP that may not necessarily focus on ESF themes (going beyond TO8-TO11). The Common Provision Regulation seeks to strengthen the result orientation of policies, and requires that evaluations assess notably effectiveness, efficiency and impact. The figure shows that in the early programming years, evaluations tend to be mainly process oriented. The initial focus of most planned evaluations is on the extent to which funding is managed in implementation of projects (implementation), or the extent to which programmes meet the targets set by the various indicators (progress). From 2018 onwards, the situation is reversed and most evaluations planned are more clearly result-oriented, and aim to measure the impacts achieved by the various programmes. The increasing importance of impact evaluations over time are in line with what could be expected; as the programmes come closer to their ends, impacts can be better evaluated. At the same time, process oriented evaluations are important during the start-up phase of programmes and the first period of implementation, as their lessons learned can still be taken on-board in adjusting the programming. The schedule of evaluations also matches the reporting schedule foreseen by the Common Provisions Regulation. Additional reporting requirements are foreseen for spring 2017 (AIR 2016), and the considerably higher number of evaluations planned for 2016 should be seen in this context. These should provide the input for the annual reporting, and should serve to verify to what extent programmes are on the right track to meet the 2018 milestone targets. Another crucial reporting milestone is in the spring of 2019, when the AIR2018 should be submitted. This round of reporting shall report on the extent to which the 2018 milestone targets have been met, and therefore provide crucial input on whether the performance reserves may be activated. Figure 3.2 Overview of planned evaluation on ESF per TO and year versus budget Source: Evaluation Helpdesk (extract 14-09-2017 Evaluation Helpdesk database) Based on the data provided by the Evaluation Helpdesk, it was also analysed to what extent MS have planned evaluations for the thematic objectives related to ESF 6 . While throughtout the years the evaluations seem relatively well spread out across TO, the large share of evaluations targeting TO9 (Active Inclusion) in comparison to the other themes in 2019 is remarkable. No clear explanation can be drawn for this. The figure clearly shows a peak of evaluations finalising in 2017, again, to provide the data for the reporting on the 2018 milestones. For 2016, 115 evaluations were planned to be finalised (of which 36 evaluations address all TO). Overall, the number of evaluations per thematic objective is very well balanced against the financial significance of the allocated budgets. The figure to the right shows that the evaluations pay only marginally more attention to TO9 and TO11 than to the share of the total allocated budget. 6 Some evaluations address more Thematic Objectives at the same time. In these cases, one evaluation is counted several times. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Overview(cid:9)planned(cid:9)evaluations(cid:9)(ESF)(cid:9)per(cid:9)year(cid:9)and(cid:9)TO TO11 TO10 TO9 TO8 ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 11 3.2 Reporting on evaluation findings 3.2.1 Evaluation Helpdesk According to the Evaluation Helpdesk, in total 38 ESF/YEI evaluations have been published in 2016 on the programme period 2014-2020. This include 2 evaluations that solely focus on YEI, 16 evaluations focusing on ESF and YEI at the same time, and 20 solely on ESF. The dominance of YEI evaluations is in line with the ESF Regulation, which explicitly requires all MA implementing YEI to assess the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of YEI including for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee by December 31, 2015. Evaluations were published in 14 out of 28 MS, namely in Belgium (total 2), Bulgaria (1), Cyprus (1), Germany (5), France (1), Hungary (1), Ireland (1), Italy (1) Lithuania (2), Latvia (1), the Netherlands (4), Poland (15), Romania (1), and the UK (2). Poland, the Netherlands, and Germany report the highest number of published evaluations. Most published evaluations in 2016 focused specifically on IP 8.ii (11) and IP 9.i (4). Looking at the number of evaluations (ESF +YEI) that were planned to be finalised versus those that have been published, one see that for 2015 in total 12 evaluations were planned to be finalised, while 27 evaluations were published. For the year 2016 in total 115 evaluations were planned to be finalised, while only 38 evaluations have been published in 2016, pointing on delays finalising evaluations. 7 As a result implementation of the evaluation plan is not always aligned with planning. For only 19 of the published evaluations in 2016 a summary has been made available by the Evaluation Helpdesk (being half of all published evaluations). 8 Most summaries (total 10) are related to YEI evaluations (such as for Hungary, Latvia, Cyprus, France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, the United Kingdom, and Bulgaria). Summaries of non-YEI evaluations (total 9) are available for the Netherlands (total 3 evaluations including a feasibility study for conducting quasi experimental evaluation on ESF activities for social inclusion and sustainable employment; evaluation of projects promoting sustainable employment; and the evaluation of ESF support to active inclusion), Latvia (the evaluation of the State Employment Agency), Poland (the evaluation of the management and implementation system of the regional OP for Swietokrzyskie), the UK (the evaluation of the Parents, Childcare and Employment project), Ireland (the evaluation of the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme), and in Germany (total 2 evaluations including the evaluation of the consultation network for supporting skilled labour, and the evaluation on women and careers). YEI evaluations Having a closer look at the key findings of YEI evaluations that were published in 2016, the summaries of the Evaluation Helpdesk show that evidence on the effectiveness of the supported YEI measures is not available for all Ops, because several operations have not been implemented long enough to produce concrete outputs and results, or in several cases have not started up yet. Although YEI implementation was frontloaded in several MS in the years 2014-2015 to assure finalisation of YEI in 2018, delays were reported, such as the case in Scotland where the evaluation focused much on the reason for delays. 9 As a result, several YEI evaluations focused on the implementation process 7 Please note that evaluation could be (almost) finalised, but not published yet, so these are not screened by the Evaluation Helpdesk. 8 The Evaluation Helpdesk of DG REGIO and DG EMPL record the following information of published evaluations: summary statement; objective; methods used; main findings; limitations/ policy implications, and main findings per IP. 9 The evaluation report five main reasons for delays, namely: (1) difficulties to focus on 25-29 year olds, a target group which is most likely to need specific policies for employment; (2) although Southwest of Scotland represents the most deprived area in terms of high levels of unemployment, the Scottish Government aimed at combating early school leaving in this territory through the YEI but the European Commission did not admit early school- leaving as a target of the Initiative; (3) Skills Development Scotland, the national skills agency, withdrew from the YEI discussions at the end of 2014, deciding to focus its activity on mainstream ESF funds and to provide specific measures also to the young non-eligible for the YEI; (4) the MA requested a geographical flexibility clause ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 12 and the \u2018expected\u2019 potential effects of the operation, to further support the implementation phase, providing concrete recommendations for assuring an effective and efficient operation. The process oriented evaluations across MS conclude that YEI operations generally provide support to those areas that are in greatest need (like mentioned in the evaluation of Hungary and Cyprus), such as the long-term unemployed, the inactive, and discouraged young people. Moreover, it was indicated that the operations are considered appropriate, and are therefore expected to produce a significant positive impact. Nevertheless, some evaluations pointed out that that the socio-economic situation changed over the years, influencing the number of NEETS in the country / region (such as the case for Lithuania, as well as Romania where the number of NEETS decreased over time). In these cases, the remaining NEETS are likely to be those furthest away from the labour market and need therefore more specific support. For Belgium, it was indicated that reaching out to NEETS, especially those belonging to the most vulnerable groups, is challenging, pointing on the importance for differentiating support between target groups. This was also concluded in the evaluation for Lithuania, suggesting providing care services to those furthest away from the labour market. Some evaluations report on differentiated regional approaches while implementing YEI across regions, due to the regional set up of administration (by regional Ops or not). The evaluation in Lithuania points on the fact that the selection criteria for YEI support are not homogeneous across Municipalities. This was considered a factor that might hinder participation of NEETs with the same characteristics in different Municipalities. Also, the evaluation in Italy points on heterogeneity in the average effort of Public employment services (PES) among regions in terms of taking on responsibility for beneficiaries. The evaluation in France pointed on the fact that integrating the YEIs into ESF Ops has enabled a higher EU co-financing rate to be obtained, but it meant decentralisation of the management which is administratively more demanding. The aim was to integrate the YEI operations into the already existing national measures (e.g. Accompagnement Intensif Jeunes de P\u00f4le Emploi) to respond rapidly to the needs of young people and create leverage effects. Nevertheless, this was not easy to achieve at the regional level mainly due to the heterogeneity of the territorial situations. In the cases evaluations could report on outcomes, generally positive outcomes are reported , like the case of Cyprus were one operation has been implemented which is considered successful, even though it has not met all its targets (35% of the 2 500 participants were reached; 33% were employed six months after leaving the operation; and 40% were still employed in the same company). In Bulgaria, positive outcomes were reported as well, with 45% of participants having a job after leaving the scheme. The Ministry of Finance in Bulgaria even estimated (by using the SIBILA 2.0 impact assessment model) that by 2023 the YEI will have helped to increase the employment rate of the target group by 10.9% and to decrease the unemployment rate by 4.6%. One of the evaluations in France concluded that the exit rate of participants was higher than expected. The evaluation in Italy indicated that around 35% of the young who have completed the activities are now employed. The evaluation in France also showed a positive net impact on the employability of young NEETs, with participants in YEI operations having more chance to be employed (almost 8 percentage points higher in terms of probability for those of 25 and over, and 9 percentage points higher for participants up to 25). The evaluation in Italy stated that if the measures were implemented uniformly across the country, the average employability of participants would increase by 20% in relation to non- to be applied due to the high level of youth unemployment experienced in some specific areas. Due to time constraints, this request was withdrawn. Finally, a Simplified Cost Option was envisaged by the Scottish Government to be applied to all categories of individuals (adult rate, development rate, 16-17 year olds rate, apprentice rate) amounting to \u00a36.50 per hour. However, the European Commission rejected this unit cost model. According to the survey carried out, the application of the unit cost model would have made the implementation of the interventions easier. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 13 participants, pointing on a positive net effect. Comparing the YEI training and the non-YEI training in the Italian evaluation, do not show significant differences in terms of outcomes directly after completing the programme. Nevertheless, two months after completion, the evaluation shows that the non-YEI training performs better in terms of those in employment. A few evaluations point on problems monitoring and reporting on YEI results, like the case of Belgium, concluding that the YG integrated monitoring and reporting system is not developed yet. It is planned to implement soon a single monitoring and evaluation system of ALMP measures, which will provide information on YEI indicators. Several evaluations concluded that the most effective operations differ per specific target group , but are generally considered training, individual labour mediation and vocational guidance. Less effective operations were considered training for entrepreneurship and apprenticeship places (based on the result of the evaluation in Romania, Lithuania, and Italy). A personalised approach is considered more effective, taking into account the specific conditions like the area of residence the family and the health situation of the young person. Next to direct personal benefits, evaluations also showed that YEI contributed to the establishment of new partnerships between agents implementing different type of actions and to strengthen the existing ones enhancing the expertise available. The YEI contributed to the launch of innovative actions as well (such as the integrated training- accompaniment actions managed by the VDAB in Belgium). Overall, the best results were experienced where project partners and stakeholders like the Public Employment Services, schools, and municipalities cooperate. The evaluation for Belgium recommended the promotion of Corporate Social Responsibility in enterprises, and consider employers as actors who can contribute to the establishment of an effective public-private partnership. This would help to increase their participation rate to the programme measures and thus, the effectiveness of the YEI. With regards to efficiency , several evaluations reported that limited progress was made absorbing the allocated budget for YEI (such as for Italy where only 15% of the total amount of financial resources was spent per September 2015). Also, the evaluation of YEI in Cyprus pointed out that the resources for the operations implemented, seem to be adequate as the target number of participants was not yet achieved. Some evaluations calculated unit costs, like the one for Cyprus. In one of the evaluations in Belgium, it was indicated that accompanying measures have the lowest average costs, while placement actions (CPE) have the highest costs. Having a closer look at the challenges identified and (policy) solutions found , the summaries show that effectiveness and efficiency of YEI operations are hampered by changing socio-economic context (redefining target groups and operations, provision of accompanying measures), but also by the fact that operations were not implemented yet at time of the evaluation. A specific challenge is the difficulty of approaching the NEETs, especially those belonging to the most vulnerable groups. Moreover, NEETS are a very heterogeneous target group and each target group needs another combination of operations, also considering the labour market needs. Creating partnerships between public and private actors is also considered a challenge. With regards, policy implications, evaluations point on the fact that operations should better consider the level of education, the area of residence and the health issues of the young (as mentioned in the evaluation for Romania). Moreover, the evaluation in Bulgaria recommended that the operations should be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the scheme addresses the needs of the different target groups. Moreover, it was indicated that some target groups should be better addressed, like early school leavers and people with lower qualifications (as addressed in the evaluation for Bulgaria). The evaluations in Italy, France and Romania point on improvements to be made in the governance of YEI, improving the alignment between national and regional policies (Italy), increase employers\u2019 participation (Romania) and Public Employment Service (Italy and Romania), and wider group of territorial actors (France). ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 14 Evaluation of non-YEI support As already indicated, most evaluations published in 2016 concern YEI, and to a lesser extent other themes and investment priorities. Only six MS report on findings in other ESF themes, including the evaluation of the labour market integration and careers of women (DE); consultation network for supporting skilled labour networks (DE); unemployed and single parents or parents in workless household (UK); management and implementation system of OP (PL); active inclusion (NL); sustainable employability (NL); the state employment agency (LV); and finally a feasibility study for conducting a quasi- experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of policy measures that are co-financed by the ESF (NL). The findings of these evaluations are further described below per MS, since the limited number of published evaluations does not allow a meta evaluation of studies per Thematic Objective. The evaluation of the State Employment Agency in Lithuania concluded that there was a positive effect on job placement of participants from training on the job and on youth volunteer work (although not being statistical significant). The effect of vocational education, non-formal education and paid temporary public work was negative, though not statistically significant. Overall, employment measures that are closer to the labour market are, on average, more successful in getting the unemployed into work in the short term, than those that require the development of general skills and competences. The evaluation in the Netherlands on ESF support to sustainable employment at the work floor, reports that the provision of the scheme was efficient, since the clear majority of participating organisations would otherwise have not implemented the project, or would downsize the scale and size of the project. Concerning the effectiveness of the operation the evaluation concluded that awareness has increased amongst employers and employees to further invest in sustainable employability, while more than half of those interviewed stated that substantial changes relating to the organisation of work were made. In addition, measures were implemented to support employees, such as the provision of coaching, training, education courses and changes in the way projects were undertaken. The ESF subsidy succeeded in reaching a wide variety of small, medium and large enterprises in all sectors. Another evaluation in the Netherlands focused on ESF support to active inclusion , concluding that the financial progress made was considered positive and first results showed that 20% of participants (of 93 820 in total) in the first two years of the programme were still employed at the end of the programme. The evaluation highlights the fact that operations started only recently and consolidated data are not available at this stage. More robust findings will become available during the programme period. Moreover, monitoring data do not cover self-employment or participation in educational pathways. The most effective operations in meeting the needs of employers, and so favouring integration into the labour market, turned out to be those featuring a mix of instruments (e.g. for students, training and school-to-work transition schemes were the most effective; for older people, intensive personalised guidance and counselling proved the most effective). It was recommended that the use of demand- oriented instruments should be fostered and cooperation with employers and schools, including at municipal level, should be improved. The evaluation of the management and implementation system of the regional OP for Swietokrzyskie in Poland, found out that he division of tasks and responsibilities between the MA, the IB and the certifying authority is appropriate, just like the current procedures and instructions governing the management, implementation, control and certification processes, ensuring an efficient implementation of the OP. In addition, the current resources are considered adequate. Nevertheless, in terms of human capital, the lack of an incentive scheme and insufficient wages for the employees involved in the management and implementation of the OP was highlighted. The evaluation recommends the introduction of bonuses/awards based on performance as well as a greater emphasis on the professional development of the employees involved in the management and implementation of the OP. Specific training tailored to the capabilities of the employees should be organised. In addition, reduction of staff turnover is necessary ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 15 to improve the effectiveness of the work. To increase communication within the institution, a common repository of knowledge including examples of good practices in addressing difficulties should be created. The evaluation of the procedure and the implementation of the Parents, Childcare and Employment (PaCE) project report positive outcomes on the way policy operates (shifting some tasks from local authorities to PaCE Advisers). Most PaCe Advisors have been successfully integrated into Jobcentres, but their integration has been more challenging in some family-based settings. The flexible, person-led approach is welcomed by all stakeholders and participants. Nevertheless, the foreseen employment outcomes of 20% of participants (the PaCE target) is challenging (particularly in rural areas which suffer from poor infrastructure). Summaries are provided of two evaluations in Germany, namely the evaluation of the consultation network for supporting skilled labour , and second, the evaluation on women and careers as part of the Schleswig-Holstein ESF OP . The first evaluation concludes that targets are not achieved for 2016, and that the process of recruiting enterprises for the consultation was underestimated in terms of the high costs incurred and the time required. The evaluation recommended to revise the indicator system and set more realistic targets for the remaining period and improve the overall cooperation process, particularly about the design of advisory services, exchange of knowledge and the consistency and coherence in the consultations provided. The other evaluation on women and careers provides a positive assessment of the counselling activities, as well as the data quality. Evaluations hardly make use of a Counter Factual Evaluation. Some MS, like the Netherlands, conducted an evaluation exploring the possibility for implementing a Counter Factual Evaluation . The feasibility study in the Netherlands concluded that a quasi-experimental evaluation only seems feasible for part of the policy measures co- financed by ESF, i.e. those targeted at the disabled. In case it is not possible to perform a counter factual evaluation, the evaluation proposes non-experimental methods instead. 3.2.2 Evaluation findings reported in the AIR 2016 Article 50 of the Common Provision Regulation requires MS to annually prepare a synthesis of all evaluations findings of the programme that have become available during the previous financial year. While in the AIR for 2014/2015 limited attention was given to evaluations, the AIR2016 reports provide more detail on the evaluations implemented, now the programme has been running for several years. All AIR include some information on evaluations. A total of 56 AIR report that evaluations were conducted/ ongoing in 2016, for which results are reported in the AIR, while in 29 AIR it was indicated that the evaluations were conducted/ ongoing, but result were not reported in the AIR. In 23 AIR it was indicated that evaluation were planned, but not conducted yet, while in 75 AIR it was indicated that no evaluations were planned and conducted in 2016. The AIR report on findings of in total 134 evaluations in 18 MS (AT, BG, CZ, DE, ES< FI, FR, GR, HU, IT, LT, LV, NL, PL, PT, RO, SL, and the UK). This is more than presented in the section discussing the findings of the Evaluation Helpdesk. This difference is mainly caused by the fact that AIR also report on findings from evaluations published before 2016 (including findings from the 2007-2013 period) and/or ongoing evaluations in 2016. Having a closer look on the number of evaluations, in contrary to the outcomes of the evaluation helpdesk, AIR report a high number of evaluations in ES (47), DE (24), PL (16), IT (9), FR (6), and CZ (5). Around 79 evaluations are combined evaluations covering more than one objective, and in 53 cases the evaluation is focused only on one specific TO. In total 103 evaluations are reported that focus on TO8 (including YEI), followed by 89 evaluations that focus on TO9, 79 evaluations that focus on TO10, and 17 on TO11 (evaluations that cover several TO are counted double). In total 40 of all evaluations, that are reported in the AIR, are largely positive on the implementation, addressing only minor challenges, while around 80 evaluations were ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 16 considered more critical on the implementation (addressing a few positive findings). In total 12 evaluations are more negative on the implementation (addressing no positive findings). Many success factors were identified in the 134 evaluations on which AIR report. A first group of success factor relates to the relevance of ESF support, addressing the close alignment of ESF support with national and local polices, the alignment with socio-economic needs, and finally individual needs of target groups. In some evaluations, it was indicated that the economic recovery helped projects achieving project targets. Other success factors are more related to the design of the operation, such as using outcomes of previous evaluations and studies for improving the intervention(logic), providing guidance and counselling accompanying other measures (such as the use of \u2018job coaches\u2019 in IP8i), integration of ESF operations in mainstream policies, mainstreaming horizontal principles like gender equality and non-discrimination, employing outreach strategies for disadvantaged groups (IP9i), having motivated participants in projects (like migrants), focus on preventive measures, application of work based learning, use of a mix of operations at the same time, and applying a partnership approach in projects. Other success factors are more related to programme management, such as having competent project staff responsible for the delivery of ESF, a well-functioning project selection procedure, the use of simplified cost options to reduce administrative burden, and central management of funds. Challenges that are hampering ESF implementation are reported as well in the AIR of 2016. Most challenges relate to the problem to reach out to certain target groups in ESF, such as SMEs, the most disadvantaged, as well as women (providing accompanying measures for improving work life balance). Other challenges relate to procedural issues like the lack of clarity in calls for proposals about specific objectives and the type of operations to be supported, the length of the project selection procedure, the high administrative burden for applicants, and limited communication about the call for proposals. Another group of challenges relate to the lack of alignment of operations and the specific needs of target groups (e.g. skills level) and lack of alignment between ESF support and other policies and operations. Some evaluations refer to a too narrow definition of the target group, hampering participation of other groups in need, as well as problems with the use of the declaration of consent and documentation to proof that participant belongs to the target group. Other challenges have to do with problems monitoring progress (IT system and data availability on indicators) as well appropriateness of target values. At last, evaluations point on the administrative burden for beneficiaries, especially to attract smaller organisations and newcomers to ESF. Evaluation findings also refer to the complexity of working with a new ESF regulation in the beginning of the programme period. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 17 4 Scope of the ESF In the 2014-2020 programme period, the European Social Fund is structured into 187 ESF OPs, adopted by the 28 MS. The total EU budget for ESF is over EUR 83 billion for 2014- 2020, which totals EUR 86.4 billion when including the YEI ESF matching support. MS are required to match EU funding with a certain level of national co-financing. As set out in the Regulations, the levels of co-financing are determined by the economic status of the regions targeted with funding. 4.1 Scope of ESF budget Table 4.1 below summarises the total EU budgets and total ESF amount available to all MS. The allocation of the funds under the Youth Employment Initiative is also reported here. Table 4.1 Allocated ESF / YEI Budget (2014-2020) Source: Operational Programmes / AIR 2016 (updated until 6-9-2017) To better understand the priorities chosen by the MS within these overall budgets, the figure below summarises the share of ESF investments across all analysed OPs in the EU for the four ESF-relevant Thematic Objectives.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 19 4.2 Changes to Operational Programmes Since the previous synthesis report of ESF monitoring data, some MS have adjusted programmes to the objectives and target groups. In most cases, such adjustments took place within thematic objectives and as such are hardly visible at the EU level. Overall, these adjustments are marginal in comparison to the total budgets allocated. Still it is insightful to understand which MS have adjusted their programmes, how they have done so, and whether this impacts the overall funds allocated to the ESF. In BE (2014BE05SFOP002), DK (2014DK05SFOP001), FR (2014FR16M0OP004 and 2014FR16M2OP012), IE (2014IE05M9OP001), and SI (2014SI16MAOP001) these adjustments in the programming have increased the overall budget available for ESF; at the EU level the total budget has increased with 28.2 million EURO in comparison to last year. Only in SE (2014SE05M9OP001), the reverse can be observed; here the total allocation of ESF is \u20ac20.5 million lower than last year\u2019s Operational Programme. Looking at specific Thematic Objectives, the table shows a minor rebalancing away from TO 10 (IT - 2014IT05M2OP001, DE \u2013 2014DE05SFOP015), at the benefit of the other thematic objectives. However, as the table below shows, these adjustments are marginal in comparison to the total budgets allocated.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 20 5 Achievements of ESF: Programme outputs and results The main purpose of annual implementation reporting is to inform the EC on the progress made by the programme. This section presents the overall progress in terms of output and results in section 5.1, and against their targets set in the performance framework in section 5.2. Both sections present the output and results of ESF / YEI separately. 5.1 Total outputs and results reported 5.1.1 Total outputs for individuals Table 5.1 below shows that the cumulative participations significantly increased over the years from 1.2 million in 2014, towards 3.84 million in 2015 (320% increase), and 7.8 in 2016 (203% increase) 11 . A larger number of participations is reported for 2014 and 2015, compared to what had been reported in the latest synthesis report, due to updated figures in SFC2014 that were entered in the database at a later stage. 12 Most participations are reported for more developed regions (3.8 million), followed by less developed regions (1.4 million), and transition regions (1.3 million). 1.3 million participations have been recorded for the YEI 13 . From the AIRs it is not always clear whether indicator values are based on \u201cfully\u201d versus \u201cpartially\u201d implemented operations (see article 5(3) of ESF Regulation), thus not allowing a detailed analysis on the distribution of values amongst these categories. While in 2014 a few MS did not report any participations (such as AT, BG, CZ, EE, FI, HR, HU, LU, MT, RO, SL, and SK), in 2015 only for HR and RO did not. In 2016, the only country without outputs reported is Romania, due to problems with the IT system and system of data exchange, as well as delays at governance level due to a focus on preparation / setting up organisation / programme management, not yet on setting up calls for proposals. For 2016, ES, FR, IT, DE, BE, PL, PT, GR, IE, LT, NL, HU, and the UK report a particularly large number of participations (all above one million participations), most of them being the larger MS in terms of population size. There are also several MS that report a relative lower number of participations such as MT, LU, DK, CY, SL, CZ, EE, SE, and AT, almost all MS with a small population size. Reasons for a slow take up in the number of participations as reported in Croatia (2014HR05M9OP001) are delays due to a focus on setting up the organisation of the programme (setting up necessary procedures for tendering, implementation of designation procedure, enhancing capacity of relevant bodies) as well the monitoring system (missing data on household status) and lack of fulfilment of the ex- ante conditionality on the \u2018the existence of a national and/or regional strategic framework for lifelong learning policies\u2019. For Malta (2014MT05SFOP001), the MA indicates that the work to finalise all ongoing reporting obligations under ESF 2007-2013 have prevented to enter all 2014-2020 data in the monitoring system.. For Luxembourg (2014LU05SFOP001), it was reported that there were complications with the management and monitoring system (end beneficiaries not providing the values for completing the common output indicators). Denmark (2014DK05SFOP001) experienced specific challenges such as competition with other schemes (e.g. national business promotion scheme), lack of interest from beneficiaries and target groups, and difficulties to find co-financing. For Cyprus (2014CY05M9OP001), delays were reported especially for PA3 and PA4. For Slovenia (2014SI16MAOP001) it was mentioned that the improved economic situation in the country lead to lower interest in ESF funding and projects. Some MS report rapid increase of participations in 2016, compared to previous years like EE, HU, LU, MT, SE, SL and SK. In these MS for various reasons reporting in 2014/2015 11 The monitoring data does not allow differentiating between unique participants and individuals who participated in ESF multiple times. Throughout this report, the number of participations are reported, thus possibly including the same participant multiple times. 12 European Commission (2016), Synthesis Report of ESF 2016 Annual Implementation Reports 13 Note that the type of region are not recorded for YEI participants.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 22 Total participations compared to the previous programme period 2007-2013 The monitoring data allows to aggregate common output indicators at EU level (as defined in the Annex 1 of the ESF regulation at IP level). In figure 5.1, an overview is provided of the total aggregation at EU level (including common output indicators for YEI). In total, 8.1 million participations 15 are registered in ESF operations (compared to 1.3 million in 2014 and 4.2 million in 2015). 16 If compared with the total number of participations for reported in the previous programming period (Annex XXIII data), this figure is still much lower than that registered for the first three years of the 2007-2013 programming period (19.8 million participations recorded in the third year). This delay in implementation is further confirmed in the figures on financial implementation (see figure 6.1 in Chapter 6) showing that the financial implementation rates for the first three years of the current programming are lower than those of the 2007-2013 period. Figure 5.1 Cumulative number of participations over the programme years 2014-2016 based on \u2018Grand Total\u2019 versus 2007-2013 (first 5 years) Source: SFC 2007 and SFC2014, based on AIR 2016 (Grand total of participations) Based on these figures, one could conclude that ESF 2014-2020 has a considerable amount of catching up to do over the coming years. Nevertheless, one should be careful when drawing such strong conclusions, because the large difference between outputs can perhaps also be explained by the fact the ESF Regulation (Annex I) is more clearly stating that participants are those directly benefiting from an ESF operation; this is in contrast to the 2007-2013 programming period where MS sometimes reported on persons that indirectly benefited from it. Another important difference is that Annex XXIII data of 2007 and 2008 include data for almost all MS, except for the CZ and MT, while some MS did not yet report any data for 2014-2016 (due to delays in the designation process as well as set up of monitoring systems). However, in terms of financial implementation, data also show that implementation of ESF 2014-2020 is slower than in 2007-2013 (see chapter 4 for more details). In view of the relatively lower number of participations reached in the first three years of ESF 2014-2020 implementation in comparison to 2007-2013, and the similarly slow take-up of eligible to the values reported in the table above. This data update shows only marginal changes; MS recorded a total number of participations (ESF+YEI) at EU level of 7 834 199. This difference is almost entirely explained by an additional 47 444 participations recorded in the OP for Flanders (2014BE05SFOP002). 15 Monitoring systems record participations in ESF supported interventions, As a result, one individual person can participate in one or more ESF supported interventions over the programming period, For the purpose of this report we further refer to the number of participations, 16 In order to provide figures on the total number of participations, the grand total of participants is taken as reference point, Note that it is also possible to use the common output indicators on number of unemployed (CO01), employed (CO05) and inactive (CO03) were aggregated, since these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories, However, note that this aggregation is lower than the total number of participants (ZZZ) reported, Such discrepancies in totals are caused when MS do not collect all non-sensitive background characteristics.

The figure shows clearly how operations in more developed regions reach considerably higher participation (58% of participations are in more developed regions) than less developed regions (22%). Such large disparities could not be expected on the basis of budget allocations, which are considerably higher for less developed regions. While operations in less developed regions more often tend to include more structural measures (possible with lower participation), this also does not explain the ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 25 dominance of more developed regions in participation. Rather this is a result of uneven implementation of operations between different types of regions. Also in terms of the types of target groups targeted, relevant differences can e observed. A high share of inactive people ( is approached in less developed regions (31% of these participations are targeted in less developed regions, compared to on average 22% overall). At the same time operations in more developed regions target employed persons more often (64% of all respondents compared to an average of 58%). Figure 5.2 Share of type of Common outputs per type of region Source: SFC2014, based on AIR 2016 Gender sensitivity From analysing the gender distribution of participations, one sees that the participation of women and men is equally spread at EU level.

Men are overrepresented in the groups of homelessness or affected by housing exclusion (63%), participants with disabilities (56%), participants below 25 years old (55%), participants with primary or lower secondary education (55%), and participants without education attainment (55%). Groups that show a more equal distribution are the inactive, participants who live in jobless households, participants above the 54 years old who are unemployed, including long term unemployed, or inactive, not in education or training, from rural areas, migrants and minorities. When assessing the gender balance per IP, a number of IP have a majority of male participants: IP 8v (62%), IP 10iv (58%), IP 11ii (55%), IP 10i (4%). Women make up the majority of participations in in IP 8iv (90%), 8vi (88%), and IP 9iii (69%). Types of projects supported The common output indicators measuring the number of projects and entities supported, report a total of 7 413 projects by social partners or non-governmental organisations, while 5 694 projects were supported that are dedicated to the sustainable participation and progress of women in employment. Another 3 975 projects were targeting public administration / public services. ESF supported a total of 197 463 SME in the first three years of the programme. The number of projects shows a steep increase from 2014 towards 2016. Overlooking the number of projects across MS, 59% of the total number of projects by social partners or non-governmental organisations in the EU are reported by Germany, followed by Spain (10%), Czech Republic (9%), and France (5%). Germany also reports the bulk of projects dedicated at sustainable participation and progress of women in employment (61%). France reports 70% of the total supported micro, small and medium- sized enterprises. Most projects that are implemented by social partners or NGOs are reported for IP 9i (2 105), 8v (2 061) 10i (844), 10iii (486), while fewer or no projects were reported for IP 10iii, 9v1, 8vii, and 9ii, The largest number of projects dedicated at sustainable participation and progress of women in employment is reported for IP 8v, 9i, 8iv, while the largest number of projects targeting public administrations or public services at national, regional or local level are to be found under IP 10iv, 10i, 8i, 9i, 8vii and 9i; surprisingly, a lower number of projects were reported in IP falling under TO11.

For TO8 especially (and IP 8i and 8ii more specifically), the largest number of participations were reported (total 4 068 226). This was followed by TO10 (more evenly distributed around the different IP) and TO9 (main IP 9i), which both have supported 1 914 149 and 1 735 876 participations respectively. TO8 and TO10 are traditionally the areas where the highest participations are achieved with ESF (see also the previous programming period). Nevertheless, since TO8 supports existing ALMP measures, it is easier for the programme to achieve results than it would be for operations related to schools in the first years of programming. A smaller number of participations are reported for TO11 (69 792), which has traditionally covered the ESF priority areas where the lowest number of participations are recorded (supporting ESF operations at system level and training of public government officials).

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 29 The figure below describes the share of participations per category of regions, split out by investment priority. This allows further assessment on what types of regions achieve more participation in each individual investment priority. The number of participations differs strongly per category of region, and confirms the dominance of more developed regions at this stage of implementation. Most participations for 2014-2015 were reported in the more developed regions (3 763 880), followed by the less developed regions (1 421 693), and transition regions (1 293 754). In 2015, the number of participations reported was still low compared to those in more developed and transition region, but significantly increased in 2016. This is partly explained by the problems that programmes face when starting up the implementation during the early years of the programming period, as well as the problems with IT systems tracking participations. For IP 8vi, 9iv, 9v, and 10ii, a relatively large number of participations are reported in the less developed regions, mainly because these operations are set up to be considerably larger in these regions than in more developed regions. At the same time, three social inclusion IP (9i, 9ii, 9iii) see only marginal participation (6%, 8% and 7% respectively) in less developed regions. This is particularly problematic for IP9ii (Integrating marginalised communities), where less developed regions have allocated more than 10 times the budget of more developed regions (1.6 billion in less developed regions, compared to 0.15 billion in more developed regions). Particularly telling is the lack of participation in IP11ii in less developed regions, while these operation supposedly target institutions in less developed regions. Though this can be due to different methods of counting (counting institutions, rather than individuals), the difference is telling and warrants additional attention in the coming years. Figure 5.4 Relative share of participations per TO and IP and category of region (cumulative until 2016) Source: SFC2014, based on AIR 2016 18 18 The monitoring system does not require MA to report the type of region for YEI participants.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 30 5.1.2 Total results of ESF The total aggregation of the common result indicators (for ESF as well as YEI) is reported here. Table 5.6 shows the immediate results of participants upon leaving an ESF supported operation at EU level. In total 810 397 participants found employment (of which 192 977 YEI participants), 750 166 participants gained a qualification (of which 82 258 YEI participants), 148 426 participants became engaged in job searching, and 275 478 persons had entered in education (of which 39 591 YEI participants). When overviewing the common result indicators that are addressing more specific target groups, one sees that, in total, almost 0.5 million disadvantaged participants achieved a positive result in terms of employment, gaining a qualification, education or training, or engaging in job-search (of which 138 221 YEI participants). Immediate results for ESF were reported by all countries, except for CY, LU, and RO. BE, DE, ES, FR, IE, and PL, report the largest number of results, while BG, CZ, DK, and HR only report a few immediate results. When assessing the programme achievement on the common result indicators that capture longer-term effects, 14 MS already report on results six months after completing the operation (compared to 7 MS in 2015). These are BE, CZ, DE, EE, ES, FR, HR, HU, IE, IT, PL, SE, SI, and the UK. AT, BG, CY, DK, FI, GR, LT, LU, LV, NL, PT, RO, SK do not yet report long-term results for ESF, while for YEI CY, CZ, GR, HR, HU, LT, PL, PT, RO, SI and UK do not yet report on common ESF long-term result indicators 19 . MS are not obliged to do this as the regulation only obliges Member States to report on these indicators for the first time in AIR2018, to be submitted in 2019 20 ). In these MS ESF contributed to 0.2 million participants finding employment six months after leaving an ESF supported operation (of which 122 179 YEI participants), while sixteen thousand have gained an improved labour market situation (of which fourteen thousand YEI participants). Upon closer inspection of the reporting on elderly and disadvantaged individuals, 3 266 participants above the 54 years old are in employment six months after leaving and ESF supported operation, while 47 334 disadvantaged persons are in employment 6 months after leaving and ESF supported operation (of which 26 221 YEI participants). The number of disadvantaged participants engaged in job searching, in education/ training, gaining a qualification, or in employment (including self-employment) upon leaving that have been reported is particularly high, especially compared to the share of disadvantaged participants among total outputs. The large number of results for this indicator could potentially be explained by the fact that this individual result indicator includes different types of results. As a result, MS could more easily place a result in this category, instead of the more difficult to measure employment situation after the operation. The table below presents the aggregated results per type of common result indicator. The immediate results (common result indicators 1-5) are split out from longer-term results (common result indicators 6-9). Totals are presented for categories of common result indicators that can be summed.

ESF support through TO8 is linked with the highest number of participants gaining employment (including self-employment). This is due to the fact that TO8 is strongly focused on access to employment. ESF operations under TO10 account for the largest number of participants gaining a qualification upon leaving, or participants in education and training upon leaving; this ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 37 is also in line with the focus of TO10 on human capital. ESF support under TO9 accounts for the largest number of inactive participants engaged in job searching upon leaving and disadvantaged participants engaged in job searching, education/training, gaining a qualification or in employment, including self-employment. The lower aggregated achievements shown for TO11 are probably due to the considerably lower financial allocation with respect to the other TOs. Moreover, operations under TO11 are generally focused on entities and the results are most likely not adequately measurable through common indicators (since operations are often focused on entities and actions such as development of new tools, change management, studies, awareness raising acitvities, partnerships, etc).

Table 5.16 below provides an overview of the average target achievement for common output indicators. Target achievement rates could be calculated only for 19 MS, because not all common output indicators are assigned a target in MS and not all output indicators with a target (already) report progress 24 . Out of the 1 659 common output indicators that have a target value, only 894 report an achievement over 2014-2016 25 . The average achievement of the target set for 2023 is 7.6%. Nevertheless, if we leave out the common output indicators that report a \u201c0\u201d achievement, this percentage is much higher, at 14.08% (not reported in the table). Some MS show relatively high performance compared to the EU average, such as BE (average target achievement of 46%), followed by FR (20.3%), CZ (15.8%), LT (13.9%), MT (9.3%), and FI (8.2%). Low average target achievement can be found in BG, HR, HU, UK, SE, SK, and IT (below 5%). 24 Targets are only set for the indicators selected for measuring the progress of the specific objectives 25 The other output indicators report a \u201c0\u201d achievement; it is unclear as to whether this means that no achievement took place or whether achievement was not-reported ",

Out of the 4 236 programme specific output indicators, 3 879 have a target (excluding TA), for which progress towards their targets is presented below. Table 5.17 reports the target achievement of MS summing up all target and achievement values, as well the average target achievement across indicators. The MS that show most progress in achieving their targets are presented in the first rows of the table. Significant differences are reported among MS, such as for MT, ES, BE, NL, EE, and GR, all showing progress in achieving their targets. At EU level, around one third of the cumulative target values is achieved, while the average target achievement across all programme specific output indicators is 83%. Low achievement is reported for RO, HR, HU, SK, UK, PT, and PL. The difference between the target achievement at MS and per indicator is considerable; the average per indicator attaches equal weight to result indicators with fewer absolute result values as to those accounting for (almost) all result values. A special case is Malta (2014MT05SFOP001) showing a very high target achievement. In its AIR, MT itself indicates that this value is incorrect. The MA reports 10 fellowships as a target, while rigid data entry rules require that progress is reported in the number of hours (22 475). This value distorts the total target achievement for Malta.

Performance against these goals is linked to the performance reserve as defined in Article 22 of the CPR. This allows for regular monitoring and debate on how financial resources are used. The table below provides an overview of the average milestone achievement for each MS and category of region (including all non-financial performance framework indicators for ESF and YEI). We calculated the total achievement ratio per MS by summing up all cumulated performance (non-financial) achievement values until 2016 and divide these by the sum of all milestone target values, per MS. This calculation method is more robust then calculating the average of all individual achievement rates of all performance framework indicators, because it is less sensitive for performance framework indicators that target small numbers with extreme achievements.

For YEI, cumulated achievement is almost equal to half the milestone target for 2018 (45%). It should be noted that the targets set in the performance framework most often refer to output indicators; only 10 result indicators were included in performance framework (in BG, FI, FR, and HU). These are all analysed together in this section. When taking a closer look at the individual performance of MS, the table shows that NL, BE, DK, DE show the most substantial progress in reaching the milestone targets, with a total achievement rate above the 100 percent. It is important to mention that the milestone achievement rate is highly influenced by the performance of individual performance indicators that are over performing 26 . In BE 17 out of 22 performance framework indicators report an achievement above 100% (of which 9 above 200%). In SI, the achievement rates are influenced by the over performance of the performance framework indicators for PAx 7 and 8 (respectively 269% and 325%). Furthermore in MT, the indicators O1 and O13 are reporting an achievement rate of respectively 437% and 302%, while the other 3 indicators in the Performance Framework report no achievement at all. The performance indicators for FI show a balanced performance across indicators in one OP (showing a maximum achievement of 163% and a minimum achievement of 62% in one OP, and no achievement in the other OP). 26 , Take for instance PF2 in NL (430%); in BE indicator 3.1.4 from the Brussels Capital OP (2014BE05M9OP002) (1310%); indicator 17 in DK (589% and 438%). ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 47 For 15 MS, the overall achievement rate remains below 35 percent, with RO, HR, CZ, UK, SE, PT as lowest performing MS. These MS generally report low or no achievements for many performance framework indicators. In RO no achievements are reported yet, while in HR for 6 out of 8 performance framework indicators no achievement is reported, just like for CZ (9 out of 19), UK (24 out of 42), SE (3 out of 4), PT (62 out of 134), and CY (5 out of 7). Other MS like LU and EE, have more balanced achievement across the performance framework indicators. LU has an a minimum achievement rate of 7% and maximum of 56%. EE, on the other hand, has a minimum achievement of 10% and a maximum of 119%. 5.2.4 Reasons for over- or under performance On top of the quantitative information on financial performance and programmes\u2019 outputs and results, MA provide a descriptive analysis of programme implementation and of issues affecting its performance. To collect and systematise this information, narrative sections of the AIR were carefully screened and the extracted information was categorised according to pre-defined categories. Table 5.22 provides an overview of the main challenges that programmes identified in their implementation and used as a reason for under-performance on target achievement. This table shows that there are three most frequently mentioned reasons for underperformance as reported in the AIR, namely: - (1) delays due to a focus on preparation / setting up organisation / programme management, not yet on attracting proposals (mentioned by 138 AIR); - (2) complications with regards to programming requirements/features (e.g. obligations of procedural nature/characteristics of the programme itself, i.e. timing/others) (mentioned by 137 AIR); and - (3) national contextual factors (political, economic, legal etc.) influencing the performance of the programme (mentioned by 135 AIR). Specific IT issues and complications related to setting up or using the management / monitoring system, are also mentioned by many AIR (respectively 74 and 71 times). Fewer AIR report on limited interest/ awareness among beneficiaries, ongoing obligations for the 2007-2013 period, incorrect target setting, late approval of OP, limited interest/awareness/command of EU funds among actors/operators, insufficient availability of matching funds. The mean reasons for low performance per MS and OP are further described while discussing the financial and output/result performance of ESF. ",

Other regularly mentioned actions by MS are further analysing / monitoring the problems (mentioned 50 times), adjustment of the governance structure such as MA/IB (mentioned 48 times), adjustment of targets (mentioned 36 times), improved engagement of stakeholders at design/ strategic level (mentioned 26 times), adjustment of budgets (mentioned 19 times), additional call for projects (14 times), adjustment of target groups (mentioned 10 times), and extending of implementation projects (mentioned 5 times). In 12 cases, no explicit measures are mentioned addressing underperformance. Overall, it is important to highlight that the quality of reporting on AIR differ. Some of the AIR report on their implementation challenges in a detailed manner, others barely mention the challenges at all, or to a limited extent. The level of detail provided also differs (sometimes reporting is too general and sometime too detailed), which doesn\u2019t provide clear information as to whether programmes are proceeding according to plan or not, and as to the actual consequences of the challenges identified. Some AIR keep sections blank or merely make some general comments on programme implementation or repeat general information from the OP or ESF regulation, while others provide detailed reflections on challenges faced and solutions found. Generally, the AIR that report larger progress in implementation seem to offer more detailed information on activities, as well as obstacles encountered and the reasons behind them.

This section presents the overall progress of financial absorption in relation to the allocated budgets in the OP for ESF and YEI together in section 6.1, and by theme in 6.2. Subsequently the chapter analyses progress of absorption in relation to the allocated budgets and the financial milestones set for 2018 for ESF and YEI separately in section 6.3 and 6.4 respectively. It is underlined that the data presented throughout this chapter is based on the data reported in AIR2016, and thus presents a state-of-play of ESF implementation at December 31, 2016. More recent data on financial implementation, for instance as reported in the quarterly updates under Article 112 CPR are not included for consistency in reporting on participations and results in the other chapters of the report 27 . 6.1 Overall progress in financial implementation Overall progress of implementation can be assessed by comparing the reported spending against the total allocated budget for each MS. This gives some indication on how far MS have been able to implement their ESF programmes, and whether the implementation is on track. Table 6.1 below presents the key figures in this respect, distinguishing between the eligible costs reported for selected operations (based on which the project selection rate is calculated) and the declared expenditures (which serve as the basis for the % expenditure declared). To assess progress over time, the table also presents the difference in percentage points in comparison to the values reported in the previous year (AIR 2015), and thus allow a better understanding of which MS are accelerating or decelerating their implementation. 27 An assessment of progress based on the quarterly financial reporting as per Article 112 CPR does not fall under the scope of this study.

Across MS, there is a striking difference, ranging from project selection rates of 2.9% of the total budget in RO to 99.9% in IE. Likewise, different developments can be seen across MS when comparing the project selection rate against that of last year. These two elements are presented in the table above and presented graphically in the figure below. The lower left corner of the figure shows MS where still relatively limited project activity is reported, both in 2016 and 2015 (RO, CY, IT, PL, ES, AT). A second group of MS can be identified around the EU average, in which first steps have been reported in 2015, and which have been moderately expanded in this year (LT, SK, DK, GR, BG, PT). Thirdly, a group of MS ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 53 in the upper right corner reported relatively limited progress in 2015, while reporting substantial progress in terms of project selection rate in 2016 (CZ, MT, HU, SI, NL, LU). Finally, a last group of MS in the lower right corner had already reported comparatively high project selection rates for 2015 and slightly increased its project selection rates in 2016 (SE, FR, DE, UK, LV, BE, EE, IE). Figure 6.1 Progress in development \u2013 project selection rates 28 Source: AIR 2016 While project selection rates are an important measure to assess the progress of ongoing ESF programmes, the declared expenditures give a more accurate picture of the implemented activities. Table 6.1 above shows relatively low expenditure rates, currently at 5.9% of the allocated budgets at EU level, with only marginal differences among categories of regions. While many MS did not yet report eligible expenditures in AIR 2015 (AT, BE, CY, ES, HR, HU, IE, LU, LV, MT, NL, RO, SI, SK), better results are reported this year, as only AT and IE do not yet report eligible expenditures. However, most MS have declared less than 10% of the total budgets as eligible expenditure in AIR 2016. Similarly to Figure 6.1 above, Figure 6.2 shows the relative position of individual MS against expenditure declared. In view of the low level of eligible expenditures reported last year the figure plots a more linear pattern than the one on project selection rates. Roughly three clusters of MS can be identified. A first group (DE, FI, FR, GR, LT, NL, PT) leads the group and reports average eligible expenditures of roughly 10% of the total MS budget in 2016. A second group around the EU average declared more modest expenditures in 2016, at around 5% of national allocations (IT, DK, PL, SI, CZ, BG, LU, SK, EE, SE, CY, LV). A third group of MS declared little to no eligible expenditures in 2016, and will thus need to compensate in the years to come (AT, RO, IE, ES, HR, HU, BE, UK, MT). 28 Excluding HR from this figure, which is an outlier due to inconsistent reporting with AIR2015.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 54 Figure 6.2 Progress in development - % expenditure declared Source: AIR 2016 Various factors can explain the different patterns across MS in financial progress and these are provided mainly based on the possible explanations provided by MS themselves. These often depend on rather country-specific explanations. Some more general factors can also be considered. One more general explanation that can underlie financial performance of ESF programmes can be related to the specific OP architecture. When setting up the partnership agreements and the OP, MS chose whether or not to combine the ESF with other ESI funds into a multi-fund OP, or to separate OP. Figure 6.3 below summarises the key financial progress indicators for each type of OP that could be found. Remarkably, the figure shows considerable differences, which may explain some of the variation in implementation above. Figure 6.3 Progress in implementation in different types of OP Source: AIR 2016 The overall project selection rate for all ESF OP by the end of 2016 is 31%. The figure shows a substantial difference between single fund ESF OP (33%) and OP that combine ESF and ERDF operations (21%). This suggests to difficulties of combining implementation of these two funds in a single OP. Other combinations appear not to have this similar problem; multi- fund OP that combine ESF with YEI show relatively similar performance, while other combinations (with the Cohesion Fund) even show higher project selection rates. Given the large number OP that are either single\u2014fund ESF (78OP) or ESF / ERDF (70 OP) these differences in implementation are rather robust. They are also confirmed in qualitative ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 55 comments in AIR. It is further confirmed by the same pattern shown by the declared expenditures, which lies on average at 8% in single-fund ESF OP, and reaches 3% in ESF / ERDF OP. Such implementation challenges in combining ESF and ERDF are also mentioned by MS: in IT, ES, FR and SE, MA report that multi-fund ESF / ERDF OP are more difficult to manage than single-fund OP. The differences in fund-specific rules and different levels of detail necessary for each fund complicate the management of multi-fund OP. Where differences in the Fund-specific Regulations for instance lead to different application procedures for projects, this often contributes to confusion among beneficiaries and MA alike. Such differences require that the MA and IB, but also the project promoters are trained and informed about the different procedures and what is expected from them. As a result, early implementation in these more complex multi-fund OP experienced delays that single-fund ESF did not. This problem was also irrelevant for multi-fund OP that combine ESF / YEI, because these are based on the same Regulation. In SE, the MA reports that this problem was solved in its multi- fund OP for rural regions by assigning a single authority for all funds in the region and applying the most detailed requirements of implementing and financial regulations (in this case of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) to ESF, ERDF and EMFF implementation. Implementation complexities are most visible in the case where multiple funds have overlapping target groups, yet can support them only once. ES mentions for instance a number of examples where certain target groups were no longer considered eligible for funding under ESF because these already received support under different types of operations from different funds. In FR as well, some ESF operations were put on hold to give priority to certain ERDF projects to the same target groups. While these can actually be examples of how multi-fund OP can lead to synergies when addressing similar target groups, these manifest themselves firstly as delays in implementation. In the remainder of this chapter the differences in implementation between MS and programmes are further explored. Various factors can explain the different patterns across MS in financial progress and these are provided mainly based on the possible explanations provided by MS themselves. To further assess such clarifications behind differences in implementation progress of ESF by the end of 2016, the report proceeds with a more detailed assessment of financial implementation against the detailed performance targets, and across different thematic objectives in the next sections.

The progress of implementation is further assessed by by investment priority. This section seeks to provide a bird\u2019s eye view of implementation from a financial perspective since 2015. A more detailed assessment of financial implementation and specific links to outputs and results is made in chapter 8. Figure 6.4 Absorption of budgets to IPs under TO8 Source: AIR 2015-2016 29 Figure 6.4 shows some variations between the investment priorities under the Employment objective (TO8). First of all, the project selection rate of YEI operations is currently at 62% of the total budget and considerably higher than that for the other investment priorities, or the youth unemployment operations (8ii) that are not part of YEI. This should also be expected, given that three of the five years for YEI implementation have already passed; as such this value is in line with what should be expected. Across other IP (8i, 8ii, 8iii, 8iv, 8v,), the project selection rates are relatively similar. Only for the smaller IP (8vi \u2013 active ageing, 8vii \u2013 modernisation of labour market institutions), the project selection rates are lower. In comparison to the project selection rates in AIR2015, particular progress has been reported for IP8i and IP8v in 2016. However, for operations under IP8ii (non-YEI) project selection rates are increasingly relatively slowly. This is mainly due to priority that MS assign to YEI projects, in view of the 2018 deadline. 29 YEI presented as separate funding for IP8ii. IP 8ii-YEI includes (1) the dedicated EU budget line, (2) mirrored by the ESF share dedicated to YEI, and (3) national co-financing to this ESF share. Investments reported under IP8ii (non-YEI) are not related to YEI, and only consist of ESF funding. ",

Remarkably, while overall the implementation is no different from the other thematic objectives (see table 6.2), the figure shows large differences between investment priorities. While implementation of the \u2018catch- all\u2019 IP 9i (Active inclusion) is well underway with a project selection rate of 39%, all other IP are still showing timid project selection rates (with 9ii \u2013 integration of marginalised communities - and 9vi \u2013 community-led local development strategies even under 10%). To some extent this difference between IP is a different manifestation of what table 6.2 already showed; less developed regions show comparatively low project selection rates in TO9. As IP9ii-IP9vi have been selected more often in less developed regions, this explains the lower project selection rates in these IP. Figure 6.6 below assesses progress in more detail under TO10 and TO11. It shows a steady development of project selection rates in operations under IP10iii (enhance equal access to lifelong learning) and IP10iv (improving labour market relevance of education and training systems), while implementation in IP10i (reducing and preventing early school leaving) and IP10ii (improving the quality and efficiency of tertiary education) is still developing. However, these IP also show substantial progress in comparison to 2015. TO 11, also presented in figure 6.6, shows an overall slower take up rate, which again should be assessed from the perspective of less developed regions.

As a result, there are minor differences in MS that recently submitted a new version of their OP (BE, DK, FR, IE, SE, SI). Source: SFC2014, Latest versions OP, submitted to the EC by September 6, 2017 The figure shows clearly how the ESF milestone targets for 2018 range between 25% and 35% of the total target, which show that almost all MS are planning their programmes in line with the principle of implementation in N+3 years. Exception seems to be CY, which aims to reach 51% of the total target by 2018. The milestone targets for 2018 are unusually high in FI (71%), in comparison to the total target for 2023, while the total target itself is remarkably low in comparison to the total budget (47%); this points to an inconsistency already identified in annex II. In similar vein, the low total target for FR is fully explained by the absence of PF targets in the national OP that accounts for half of the budget (also reported in annex II. The table shows that AT, BE, CY, DK, EE, ES, HR, IE, LT, LV, PL, PT, SK and UK have included their entire non-TA budgets in the performance framework, while others have opted to include a slightly lower percentage of the total allocated budget in the performance framework. It is unclear as to why other MS have left a small share of investments outside the performance framework; MS do not provide explanations in AIR / OP. Possibly, this is related to excluding the shares in the performance reserve from the target setting. Exceptionally low final targets for 2023 can be found in BG, IT, LU, MT, NL, which as already indicated in Annex II/III, is 31 The data received for Greece has been manipulated by the research team in accordance with the quickfix suggested for the performance framework 2014GR05M9OP001, PA2, in order to correctly represent the Greek targets.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 63 explained by the fact that these MS have chosen (at least for some OP) to set their PF targets in relation to the EU-share of the allocated budget, rather than the total share. 6.3.3 Progress in financial absorption towards financial milestones With the above mentioned caveats about target setting in mind, this section moves on and compares progress towards financial milestones and targets as reported in the 2016 AIRs. Figure 6.8 Expenditure declared to EC vs financial milestones ESF Source: AIR 2016 (* refers to inconsistencies found in target setting, see Annex II/III) In the first instance, the total declared expenditure is compared against the financial milestone values set for 2018. The figure shows that the highest shares of the milestone values are achieved by NL (89%) and FR (85%). However, the PF target setting in these countries is inconsistently reported in comparison to other MS (see annex II/III). If we control for this, NL would still remain among the best performers, but no longer be an outlier (NL - 45%), while for FR the performance would considerably less impressive (13%) 32 . Other MS that are well on track to reach their milestone targets in 2018 are GR, DE, LT, PT. A large number of MS declared expenditures between 10% and 25% of their milestone target, which means that considerable additional efforts will be necessary in 2017/2018. IT is a special case in this respect, as three OP have an incorrect target setting (reported in percentages, instead of absolute values as all other OP 33 ); despite the resulting low targets in these OP, eligible expenditure is only at 11% of the milestone. While declared expenditure is the only frame of reference for assessing the achievement of financial milestones and targets, project selection rate is a better measure of ongoing progress of ESF programmes. It needs to be treated with caution, as administrative procedures after reporting eligible costs may take a long time. As such, it says little on when beneficiaries will actually start spending and certifying expenditures. However, it does show the extent to which MS are planning the implementation of projects, particularly where no or low eligible 32 To arrive at these figures (not presented in figure), the target setting for the NL was brought in line with the EU+MS allocations. For FR this could not be done as there is no target; here declared expenditures in the OP without PF target were ignored. 33 See also section 6.4.1 and Annex I and II. It refers to 2014IT05M9OP001, 2014IT05SFOP001, and 2014IT05SFOP008 ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 64 expenditures are reported. Moreover, it is important to know which MS still report no or low project selection rates at this stage. As could be expected, the project selection rates is indeed substantially higher and already surpassed the aggregated milestone values. This is presented in figure 6.9 below, which shows that this holds across all types of regions. The blue bars in the figure represent the absolute amounts contracted by beneficiaries for project implementation. While in some TO less developed regions are behind in implementation, this disappears at the aggregate level. In less developed regions 109% of the milestone value has been selected for projects, in transition regions 160% and in more developed regions this is even higher with 175% 34 . Figure 6.9 Project selection rate per region by 2016 vs achievement of financial milestone Source: AIR 2016 When further assessing individual MS, we are confronted once more with the distortion due to inconsistent targets in NL and FR, while the high value of IE is not due to inconsistent target setting. In section 6.1 we have already seen that project selection in IE covers its entire allocated budget, even though no expenditure has been declared. In its AIR, IE indicates that it expects to be able to spend the entire budget within the programme period. The national treasury pre-finances all ESF projects upfront to avoid delays in implementation / setting up projects, and has not started to send in reimbursements; this explains the large discrepancy between declared expenditure and project selection. 34 This difference between types of regions is to some extent again explained by the distorting effect of FR, which did not define a PF milestone target for half of its entire ESF budget.

With only two of the five implementation years to go until 2018, the project selection rates in CY, RO, HR, IT, and ES give reason for concern. Each of these MS point to potential efficiency gains in reporting in the coming years due to additional use of simplified cost options, and the fact that the reporting procedures for ex-ante conditionalities have been concluded. CY specifically still reports to be on track (it did so similarly last year), and explains the low level of reporting on the ground that various public procurement and grant projects were not yet recorded in the monitoring system. CY reports that calls for proposals for roughly one-third of its entire budget have been launched (which would equal roughly two thirds of its 2018 milestone and put it between IT and ES in the figure above). Below, we present in more detail the state of play of reaching milestone values. The development towards the milestone target are presented for each PAx individually and subsequently grouped in one of the categories below. It allows for a closer look at the individual state of implementation for an individual PAx (rather than at MS level as presented in the figures above), and also makes clear which MS still have PAx where the amounts contracted by beneficiaries are too low. Although there may be good reasons for the slower implementation, an additional effort will be necessary to reach the milestone in 2018 for these PAx. ",

The figures shows that currently 64% of all PAx have reached project selection rates of 60% or higher against the milestone target. This is a substantial improvement in comparison to last year. However, the figure also shows that around half of the MS still have PAx where no projects selection rates are reported. ",

The YEI resources consist of (1) a dedicated budget line (YEI specific allocation) of 3.2 billion euros, (2) a matching ESF allocation of 3.2 billion euros; these funds subsequently matched with (3) national co- financing for the ESF matching allocation; the YEI specific allocation is not subject to national co-financing 36 . In total, this adds up to 7.67 billion euros. This section refers to the total budget of these 3 resources combined as YEI. 6.4.1 Implementation against allocated budgets This section presents an overview of the implementation of YEI against the allocated budget in the table below.

In ES, IE, and RO no expenditures have been declared yet. This is mainly because some MS tend to declare expenditures only after concluding an operation. 35 Art. 16 ESF Regulation 36 Article 22(3) ESF Regulation 37 In order to check for differences between data reported in AIRs submitted by the cut-off date of this report (September 6, 2017) and the time of writing, data from AIR updated until November 22, 2017 were compared to the values reported in the table above. This data update shows only marginal changes in comparison to the data presented. Only FR recorded an additional \u20ac4 757 938 as eligible costs in the newer data (in total \u20ac4 761 372 446). The values reported as eligible expenditures are unchanged. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 68 In ES, some YEI operations were actually already initiated before the formal approval of the (revised) OP, in order to address the target groups in need in the most expedient way. Particularly these \u2018older\u2019 operations do not always make use of the same methodology for calculating (simplified) costs. As a result, filling the formal declarations of expenditures can takes time and will only be reported in the coming years. HU also reports that it had started implementation before the formal monitoring systems were in place, which currently contribute to problems in correctly reporting to the EC. Only in RO, the share of declared expenditures and the project selection rate are still at 0%. RO reports that it had not yet launched any call for projects, but had focused primarily on preparatory actions throughout 2016; it focused on clarifying the key requirements / preconditions for the future selection of operations. Currently, RO also reports to have set up a helpdesk, and organised various briefings and technical meetings on the guidelines for implementation. However, with only 2 years remaining for implementation of its current targets, it becomes increasingly critical to launch calls for proposals. Measured by the achieved project selection rates, CY, GR, IT, PL and UK are also located at the low end of implementation. None of these MS report any specific problems in implementation; while some of the programmes are reported to have been changed and reprogrammed over the last years, these MS indicate their confidence that they will meet the target. At the EU level, the project selection rate is currently at 62%, which is roughly equal to the 3 out of 5 years (60%) of time that has passed for implementation of YEI. The assessment of ESF implementation in section 6.4 continues to relate the progress of ESF not only to the allocated budgets, but also the milestones. However, pursuant to the relevant Regulations, the 2018 milestone values for YEI should be 100% of the allocated budget. Effectively, this would therefore come down to presenting the same data of table 6.5 again. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 69 7 Efficiency The unit costs of programmes, both within and across MS and policy themes, are a relevant indicator for monitoring implementation of programmes. This chapter explores the development in unit costs, to help understanding the extent to which expenditure and participations are recorded in a balanced way. Section 7.1 starts by exploring the costs per individual output, and section 7.2 further explores the costs per result. The project selection rates are a good measure of the extent to which programmes are progressing in their implementation, and are a relevant variable in assessing the progress of programmes from a financial side (see chapter 5). However, these are not a good measure to compare against number of participations or results, because the costs of project selection are often recorded before the participations are entered. This chapter analyses and compares unit costs, and does so by referring only to the declared expenditures . Nevertheless, unit costs could still not represent the full picture, since OP sometimes record participants after operations are fully implemented and other times when operations are partly implemented. As a result, it is recommended that unit costs are only used as a measure for efficiency at a later stage in the implementation of programmes, when more operations are fully implemented and findings are less distorted by different proportions of fully and partially implemented operations. Only then, unit costs can be better compared and used for assessing the efficiency of programmes. 7.1 Costs per output To calculate the costs per output, first of all, RO was excluded from the analysis, as it did not report participations. While AT and IE did report participations in operations, no declared expenditures are reported by these MS, which are therefore also excluded. The results for comparing the number of individual participants registered against the total eligible expenditure declared are presented in the table below 38 . 38 The total number of participants is calculated by summing common output indicators 1, 3, and 5, which present exclusive and complete types of output indicators for individuals participating in an intervention.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 70 [ C a t a l o g u e n u m b e r ] [ C a t a l o g u e n u m b e r ] Table 7.1 Eligible expenditures declared to EC per participation Source: SFC2014 - AIR 2016 Overall, the table shows a cost per participation of EUR 1 097, which is roughly in line with the unit costs that were found in the ex post evaluations of ESF 2007-2013 39 . Nevertheless, this aggregated figure masks important differences across MS and thematic objectives. Though the variation between figures reported is high, most of these differences are not substantial: large differences are the result of the ongoing nature of the entry of monitoring data, and may vary considerably each year. No particular reasons were mentioned in the AIR of these MS that could help to explain these relatively high figures. Some extremely high values (LT in TO11, but also CZ across all objectives) are likely to become more balanced once more data on participations is recorded into SFC. As already mentioned in chapter 3, various MA reported in their AIR that the actual number of participations is higher than reported. The same holds true for extremely low values; it is also possible that MS have recorded the number of participations accurately in SFC, however, still need to file declarations of expenditures. As has been shown above, various MS face a backlog in declaring expenditures. Despite these caveats about the data in individual MS, it is possible to already observe some broader trends at the aggregate level. For instance, the difference between the unit costs for 39 The synthesis report of the ex post evaluation of ESF 2007-2013 report an overall cost per participants of \u20ac897, with \u20ac1 113 for Access to Employment, \u20ac681 for Human Capital & Adaptability, and \u20ac1 763 for Social Inclusion.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 71 operations in less developed regions against other types of regions are telling. This suggests that the number of participations reported in less developed regions is considerably lower than in more developed / transition regions, against similar levels of declared expenditure. Such imbalances are discussed in more detail in chapter 8. 7.2 Costs per result A similar analysis has been performed to assess the costs for reaching immediate individual results (obtaining employment, qualification, entering education or searching jobs) 40 . Also for this analysis, the declared expenditures declared are compared with the immediate individual results reported. As above, MS were excluded if no declared expenditures (AT, IE) or results were recorded (CY, LU, RO). To avoid large distortions in the unit costs per result, MS with only a very limited number of individual results are also excluded (less than 300 individual results in BG, CZ, DK, HR). The results of this analysis are presented in table 7.2 below. While already limited to an even lower number of MS than when investigating the costs per participation, this analysis for results has additional limitations. First of all, the costs declared for investment priorities are compared with the immediate results achieved. Information on the results in the longer-term is collected at a later stage (AIR2018) and is therefore not included here. Table 7.2 Eligible expenditures declared per short-term result achieved 40 The total number of individual results was calculated by summing common result indicators 1-4, which all present exclusive types of results in terms of improved labour market position of individual participants that may be reached. CR05 was not included as it is not an exclusive category from common result indicators 1-4; it would introduce double counts and therefore taint the analysis. Nevertheless, the figures presented should be read with some caution, since participants could achieve more result at the same time.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 72 Source: SFC2014 - AIR 2016 Overall costs per short term result for the MS in the analysis amount to EUR 3 719. Behind this value are substantially large variations among MS and Thematic Objectives than found in the analysis of costs per output (see table 7.1). These variations are mainly caused by the relatively fragmented way of reporting of individual short-term results in SFC, which most likely will improve in the coming years. However, a unit cost analysis of results (similar to an analysis of the unit costs per participation), can be insightful to compare MS with regard to the extent to which results and eligible expenditure are registered into SFC in relatively equal shares. When used for this purpose, unit costs does not necessarily tell us much about efficiency, but rather about the balance in reporting between results and financial progress. Table 7.2 above shows how many MS still report relatively small numbers of results in relation to the budgets invested in TO9. The \u2018unit-costs per results\u2019 in LT, PL, PT, and SI are comparatively high. Possibly, operations in this TO depend more on long-term results than operations in other TO. This pattern is particularly clear when looking at the types of region; less developed regions show considerably higher unit costs per result (on average \u20ac 6 073) in comparison to 3 957 and 2 212 in more developed and transition regions respectively. .

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 73 8 Contribution of ESF to EU policies Cohesion policy represents a key instrument for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives and targets. The thematic objectives and underlying investment priorities allow a thorough assessment of the objectives of ESF programmes at the national and EU level. This chapter assesses the progress towards the specific thematic objectives of current implementation of ESF 2014-2020. Before assessing the contribution to EU policies, a number of consistency checks have been conducted, which are reported in detail in Annex III. This chapter starts in isection 8.1 with progress reported for TO8, section 8.2 covers progress under TO9, section 8.3 for T010, and section 8.4 for TO11. This section is based on a synthesis of the various chapters provided above, in combination with the qualitative information provided by MS in the 187 AIR analysed for this report. 8.1 Thematic Objective 8: Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility The EU2020 Headline target aims to bring the employment rate for women and men aged 20- 64 to 75% by 2020, including the greater participation of youth, older workers and low skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants. By promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility in TO8, ESF seeks to contribute to the EU 2020 objectives for Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This section assesses the ESF\u2019s contribution to this objective. As part of the EU2020 strategy national targets have been set for individual MS. MS have the possibility to use ESF to complement their national efforts towards meeting these targets. When assessing MS performance on their progress towards reaching the national target for the employment rate (see figure 8.1), one sees that countries can be clustered into two main groups. First of all, there is the group that is still far from reaching the national targets; this group includes GR, ES, BG, CY, BE, IT, FR, SI, FI. The nine countries in this group are all more than 5 percentage points below their national target, while the distance to the target for the EU as a whole is 4.9 percentage points. The second group consists of 11 countries that are closer to the national targets, such as PT, RO, HU, NL, DK, LU, AT, SK, PL, HR, MT. Finally, six countries \u2013 LV, EE, SE, IE, DE, CZ, LT - have already reached their employment targets 41 .

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 74 Source: Eurostat (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/europe-2020-indicators) MS that are still distant from their national targets may decide to use the ESF to complement their national efforts towards meeting their overall targets. To provide specific support towards the national employment targets, a number of specific investment priorities are defined by the ESF Regulation, which further narrow down the objective and type of operation. Article 3 in the ESF regulation restricts operations under Thematic Objective 8 to the following categories: \uf0b7 (8i). Access to employment for job-seekers and inactive people, including the long- term unemployed and people far from the labour market, also through local employment initiatives and support for labour mobility; \uf0b7 (8ii). Sustainable integration into the labour market of young people, in particular those not in employment, education or training, including young people at risk of social exclusion and young people from marginalised communities, including through the implementation of the Youth Guarantee; \uf0b7 (8iii). Self-employment, entrepreneurship and business creation including innovative micro, small and medium sized enterprises; \uf0b7 (8iv). Equality between men and women in all areas, including in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life and promotion of equal pay for equal work; \uf0b7 (8v). Adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to change; \uf0b7 (8vi). Active and healthy ageing; \uf0b7 (8vii). Modernisation of labour market institutions, such as public and private employment services, and improving the matching of labour market needs, including through actions that enhance transnational labour mobility as well as through mobility schemes and better cooperation between institutions and relevant stakeholders. The remainder of this chapter further assesses how the ESF contributes to each of these investment priorities. It assess the progress in implementation and presents the explanations and justifications for lack of implementation in MS. This allows a better understanding of the current contribution of the ESF to the main EU policy objectives. 8.1.1 IP8i. Access to employment Most operations in the field of IP8.i relate to mainstream ALMP activities such as providing individual guidance to job seekers, providing integrated approaches, VET training, and providing hiring incentives to employers or supporting apprenticeships / traineeships and self- employment. Operations in this IP tend to target a relatively diverse range of target groups, such as unemployed people in general; long term unemployed; disadvantaged; older persons; inactive persons; women; young unemployed; low skilled; employment services; migrants; and enterprises. Except DK, all MS allocate investments in this investment priority. Overall, implementation of operations in this category is well underway, even though CY and RO do not yet report eligible costs, nor participations. In its AIR, CY reports that its key output indicator of unemployed is currently at 60% of the Performance Framework target, and roughly a quarter of the entire budget has already been contracted over the course of 2016. However, due a high workload in processing applications, it did not yet record the required data in the monitoring system and process payment requests. Moreover, it expects substantial increases in participations and results over the coming years, in view of the number of projects that started up already.

Such apparent inconsistencies are the results of the ongoing data entering activity into SFC, for various reasons. In any case, this shows that implementation is underway in these MS. On average across the EU, the project selection rate lies at 34%, with average output target achievement of 33%. While the share of eligible costs of the allocated budget (project selection costs) vary substantially due to different approaches to reporting, the outputs achievement are more balanced, and vary roughly between 15 and 35% of the set targets. Particularly high target achievement is found in BE (Wallonie \u2013 Bruxelles). This is not caused by one indicator, but by various indicators of participations, which surpassed their targets multiple times. BE in fact reports that implementation for these PAx has slowed, and no reference is made to the apparent overachievement in this area Overall, 1.6 million participations have already been reported across the EU, which is more than double the amount reported in AIR2015 (0.6 million); this indicates that implementation is well underway. Nevertheless, there are considerable differences between different types of regions. While less developed and more developed regions report similar project selection rates (and roughly equal eligible costs), more developed regions reported more than double ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 76 the amount of participations. Also in comparison to the initial targets set for individual indicators, the output indicators reported in more developed regions are progressing considerably smoother than less developed and transition regions. At the same time, less developed regions show considerably higher shares of individual results, relative to the targets, but also in absolute terms. ES, LT and particularly PL are responsible for these high values. In relation to the targets achieved for result indicators BE, LT, PL and SI stand out, each already above 50% of the result indicators set. However, the high average share of target achievement at EU level (and for less developed regions more specifically) is mainly caused by PL. PL has a large number of indicators (158 of 387 indicators in this IP) with already achieved targets 42 . If we exclude PL, the average result achievement rate in the EU drops to 15.2%. Also in comparison to the participation recorded, these MS show relatively high success rates (i.e. number of result per participation at PAx level, averaged at MS level). These MS indicate in their AIR that the economic recovery and improved labour market conditions contributed to these values. Nevertheless, each MS underlines the need for continued intervention. At EU-level, on average one individual result has been achieved for every four participations (25%). This is relatively low, though already considerably better than last year (16%). Based on the results of the 2007-2013 ESF programme, the balance should be expected to be between 30%-40% for employment operations. However, as the table shows, many programmes already reported participations, while no results have been reported yet. The best example of these are BG, CZ, GR, HU, which have projects running under this priority, and already report costs and participations, however, deem it too early to reliably report on the results achieved. Though most visible in these 4 MS, this issue affects more results reported. Instead, results of ongoing projects are expected to be entered into the monitoring system once projects have been concluded. 8.1.2 IP8ii. Sustainable integration into the labour market of young people Employment of young people has received a substantial level of policy attention, not least through the additional allocations under the Youth Employment Initiative. Progress achieved by YEI funding is already discussed in the chapters above, and this section only includes amounts and participations to ESF operations in the field of youth unemployment that are not supported by YEI. Operations under this priority seek to improve the labour market access for young people, mainly by reaching out to non-registered young people not in employment. First of all, the table shows the data issue in FI (reported in detail in Annex II/III), which sometimes provides incorrect links between allocated budgets and intervention fields of costs 43 . The high project selection in BG is related to the fact that most of its budget for supporting unemployed youth in its OP is allocated to IP8i, while its implementation in the AIR is allocated to IP8ii. BG does not provide any explanations for this inconsistency in reporting. Overall, implementation of operations targeting youth unemployment outside the scope of YEI is considerably slower than that of YEI, but also than general employment initiatives under IP8i. Though considerably improved in comparison to last year, with doubled project selection rate and a substantial increase in the number of participations and results, MS that also implement YEI tend to focus on the implementation of YEI, and keep the ESF operations for young persons on hold. No project selection has been reported in GR, LT and RO; these MS indeed point to efforts conducted of YEI operations under IP8ii. Over half of the total participations in the IP are recorded in IT, and a substantial number also in PL both of which nevertheless still report low output target achievement. As for IP8i, more developed regions have spent roughly the same budgets on operations as less developed regions, yet report considerably higher participation numbers. To some extent this is accurate as less developed regions started entering monitoring data later, and may catch up. However, as was also the case for IP8i, more individual results are reported for less 42 The target achievement rates are calculated as the average achievement rate per indicator. As such, one MS with a high number of indicators (in this case PL) has a large influence on the overall achievement rate. 43 Note that this is recurrent issue for FI that is also discussed elsewhere in this report.

PL is largely responsible for this contrast, reporting over a third of the total of 120 155 short-term results achieved under this priority. Other MS that already reported positive results are BE and DE. Given the overall low numbers of results reported, it is still too early to assess a contribution to EU policies.

Most plans for implementation have been received since March 2016, but integrating the relevant monitoring data is only planned after all projects have been formally approved and initiated. In DE, DK, ES, FR and PL, implementation seems well underway, each reports both costs and substantial participations already. While implementation of this priority seems well underway in MS that allocated the most substantial budgets, the target achievement rate for output remains relatively low; at the EU level this is so far only 6%. Note in this respect that output targets under this priority may not always focus on participations, and often measure the number of business proposals received, assessed and or approved. It seems rather early to already assess the results of operations that contribute to business creation. Still, no less than 22 161 individual results have been recorded, mainly in FR and DE. In most other MS, no or low results have been achieved so far. However, this does not affect the assessment of the implementation.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 79 8.1.4 IP8iv. Equality between men and women Investment priority 8iv combines ESF investments that seek to improve equality between men and women in all areas, including in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life and promotion of equal pay for equal work. These operations mainly target women, the unemployed, enterprises and employees. The 'New Start' initiative to address the work-life balance challenges faced by working parents and carers is an important element of the European Pillar for Social Rights 44 . The initiative aims to make better use of European funds to improve long-term and childcare services, as such the ESF is a central mechanism to contribute to this initiative. At this stage, no evidence in the analysed AIR suggests that Operational Programmes have been reprogrammed to increase investments in this priority. Many projects under this investment priority already seek to develop and introduce new initiatives to improve work-life balance and ensure better reconciliation between working, living and care for children (BG, DE, IT, ES, GR, HU, LV, PL, CZ). Support for childcare facilities are central to this objective, and ESF projects focus on opening new centres (GR, PL), vouchers to assist in paying for childcare (IT, GR) offering more flexibility and longer opening hours (HU, LV, PL, PT), and better supporting childcare workers (PL, IT). Some MS report specifically that even though they have no allocated ESF investments to this investment priority, they allocated similar investments to improve work-life balance under the label of combating discrimination (IP9iii), or do so by investing national resources. The overall project selection rate lies at 24.6%, which is a considerable improvement from last year\u2019s 12%, and is mainly influenced by substantive improvements in project selection in DE, GR and SK. No or few budgets were reserved for projects in AT, ES, HU, and PT. In ES, participations are recorded, and also the AIR of the concerned OP all report of ongoing activities. No explanations are provided by financial data has not been recorded by Spanish OP. In AT, an implementation concept was being developed in 2016, which would underpin the further programming; the procurement procedure has not yet been completed. The HU AIR does not explain why no funds have been reported; however, the allocated budget to this IP is relatively small. PT reports that no calls for tenders / calls for proposals have been launched under this IP, because of the lack of definition of public policy priorities and the lack of specific regulation for the respective instrument. PT therefore concludes that it is necessary to make changes to the financial allocation foreseen for the IP, as well as to propose adjustment of the targets taking into account the time available for their execution. In PL, progress of implementation under this priority has been relatively slow, with a project selection rate of 7.9%, and only 518 participations recorded thus far. Given the size of the initial allocated budget (roughly 23% of the entire IP), this has a substantial effect on the overall implementation of the entire IP at EU level. Some Polish regions reported a lack of interest of project promotors to submit proposals under this IP. An evaluation of these operations underlines that foreseen employment outcomes of 20% of participants is challenging, particularly in rural areas which suffer from poor infrastructure. As a result, a number of MA consider reducing the targets for various indicators under the objectives of reconciliation of professional and private life. While not all Polish OP report progress on this particular IP, this IP is organised as smaller component of the broader active labour market policies in every Polish OP, and therefore not necessarily a priority area. The overall performance of the IP is considerably compensated by the performance in GR, which has had an active operation since 2014 that aims to ensure equal access for parents to work by providing care and hospitality to babies, infants, children and disabled people in corresponding structures. GR scores well in terms of project selection, participations, and in terms of result target achievement.

Adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs IP 8.v includes a wide diversity of actions addressing employers (and managers of enterprises) on the one hand and employees on the other. With regards to the employers, ESF mainly supports actions that facilitate the introduction and management of change in organisations to prevent or mitigate the consequences of economic restructuring (e.g. guidance and training support, making the diagnosis and developing restructuring / action plans for introducing more innovative, more productive and greener models of labour organisation, including safe and healthy working conditions, managing the changing demographic structure of the company).

As we have seen before, RO does not yet report on the implementation of its activities. Project implementation under this IP is generally well underway where large amounts are reserved. The largest budgets are reserved by DE, FR and PT. DE and FR are progressing nicely, with project selection rates of 41.5% and 49.1% respectively. PT also has a large investment reserved for projects under this priority, but is trailing these MS substantially. Because the procedures for processing payment claims were not fully functional when the largest operation was launched, financing of the operations has been delayed and the processing times for evaluating proposals were extended. Two minor operations are still awaiting the definition of public policy priorities and specific regulation for the respective instrument. While these problems are now reportedly resolved, PT does not expect to meet the PF targets related to this IP, and will therefore work to review these in 2017. Not surprisingly, DE and FR are also responsible for the largest number of individual participations in this IP, and are the only MS with meaningful numbers of individual results in this area. However, both have ambitious targets; across most of its regions the IP has not yet reached more than 20% of the targets set. Because of the dominance of DE and FR in this IP, the results split by type of regions also show a dominance of more developed regions over others. CZ reports a relatively high project selection rate, yet does not report participation.

Active and healthy ageing Investments under IP8vi mainly support the development of tools and instruments for organisations, raising the awareness of healthy ageing and providing incentives for companies to hire older workers. As such, these operations are directed at relatively similar target groups as those targeted by IP8v, which includes employees, older workers, employees at risk, and enterprises. Indirectly, the investment priority is linked to various country specific recommendations that focus on pension reforms and increasing the retirement age. It can be argued that MS about to initiate pension reforms also need to increase policy attention to measures that promote active and healthy aging. Table 8.6 below shows that MS have assigned limited attention to this IP, with NL and PL together allocating roughly 75% of the entire budget allocated to this priority across the EU. Other MS (AT, FR, IT, SI) have allocated only minor investments, often in combination with calls related to other priorities. Note the incorrectly allocated costs for FI, which does not have allocated budgets, nor participations in this IP. NL already shows a relatively high project selection rate (46.1%), as it made a start with a first type of projects, in which enterprises were targeted.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 85 out. Progress for the schemes is reported in 2016 on the specific performance indicators (yet not for financial implementation). Despite allocated budgets and already reported eligible costs, no progress has been reported so far for BE, CY, HR, and SK. A closer look shows that this is not due to backlogs in reporting, but actually the result of halted implementation. In CY, the project that would support the strengthening of the PES was not approved; no activities have therefore taken place. In HR, delays are reported with regard to implementation of this operation, and so far no participations and results have been achieved. No reference to this specific priority is made in AIR in BE and SK, other than the general observation that operations in the same PAx have incurred delays. FR is an interesting case, with a relatively small allocated budget and the only one that reports substantial individual participations. Steps have been taken to support modernisation of the PES, and, although no explanation has been provided in the AIR, the recorded participations are most likely clients of the PES. In CZ, a project selection rate of 28.8% is reported, though no individual participation are recorded as of yet. The AIR explains that this is caused by a number of failed attempts to transfer data from the monitoring system to SFC. Existing participations will be reported in the next project implementation reports. 8.1.8 Overview TO8 The previous section has shown that the implementation of the operations under Thematic Objective 8 has firmly started, though still faces considerable growing pains in a number of IP. Operations that seek to increase access to the labour market (IP8i) has shown the most stable development in implementation, both in terms of project selection rate (34.2%), number of participations (1.6 million) and the number results for individuals (0.4 million) already reached. Because it is also responsible for 40% of the entire budget in TO8, it is an important finding that implementation of this central IP is on a relatively steady track. The operations with a focus on integration of youth on the labour market (IP8ii) are also moving ahead steadily, though it became apparent that MS tend to give YEI operations priority over the implementation of ESF-funded employment measures for young persons. The project selection rates, number of participations and number of individual results all suggest that in the early years MS tend to first concentrate on the larger IP (IP8i, 8ii, 8iii, 8v), while the implementation of smaller IP, such as IP8iv, 8vi, and 8vii are more often delayed, or simply awaiting implementation. Such delays are due to various reasons, such as lack of interest by project promoters, delays in broader programme implementation, such as the definition of national guidelines and regulations to guide implementation, or the lack of national policy guidance. In a number of cases MA indicate that the number of participations reported in their AIR underestimates the actual participation numbers. The coming years will show whether MAs will catch up on these delays.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 86 the headline target for employment. While 600 000 individual results over 3 years can be of inherent value, it is at best a modest contribution against the current population of 18.7 million unemployed people across the EU 45 . Moreover, in its current stage of implementation, the monitoring data does not suggest that ESF contributes positively to the EU\u2019s broader objective of social and economic cohesion in the Union. Most progress in implementation so far has been recorded in MS that are already close to or passed their national employment targets (DE, LV, LT, CZ, EE) 46 . At the same time, MS that would benefit most from ESF as instrument to complement national funding towards the headline target, are facing delays in implementation, and as a result limited support to progress against the target (BG, CY, ES, IT, PL, RO). 8.2 Thematic Objective 9: Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty, and discrimination In order to reduce poverty in the EU, the EU 2020 headline target aims to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty. The flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the Social Investment Package and the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, support efforts to reach these targets. These are amplified by the ESF, of which at least 20% of the ESF resources should be allocated to the promotion of social inclusion. This section assesses the ESF\u2019s contribution to this objective. Progress towards the headline targets has been varied, particularly as the economic and financial crisis posed challenges towards meeting these targets, as shown in figure 8.2 below. Figure 8.2 Distance to national poverty reduction target (2015, in thousands) 47 Source: Eurostat (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/europe-2020-indicators) EU MS can be divided into countries that have already reached their national targets (BG, RO, PL), a large group that is relatively close to its targets (BE, IE, NL, PT, AT, DK, SI, CY, C, LT, LU, LV and MT), and countries that are more distant from their targets, with the largest differences reported for ES, FR, GR and HU 48 . Different EU-level strategic documents emphasise the need for additional efforts to ensure the effectiveness of social protection systems, in order to counter the effect of the economic crisis, promote social inclusion and prevent poverty by activating inclusion strategies (including efficient and adequate income support, measures to tackle poverty, as well as 45 http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics 46 Exception is Greece, which also shows considerable progress in the implementation of TO8 in its ESF programme. 47 Limited data (about half of MS) available for 2016 at time of report writing (October 2017). 48 For DE, EE, HR, SK, FI, SE, UK no targets have been included in Eurostat concerning this target ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 87 broad access to social services). Currently, EU Member States spend varying shares of GDP on social protection, and also achieve different results in terms of reducing poverty. ESF 2014-2020 is a crucial EU-level instrument to further complement national efforts towards achieving the Headline target. In order to ensure that a sufficient share of resources is allocated to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, Article 4(2) of the ESF Regulation requests that at least 20% of the total ESF resources in each Member State shall be allocated to this thematic objective. Although higher social spending is generally associated with stronger poverty reduction, important differences exist, suggesting scope for efficiency gains. On the other hand, the link between social assistance and activation measures should be strengthened, by developing more personalised services and efforts to improve the uptake of measures by vulnerable groups. More specifically, ESF supports the promotion of social inclusion and combating poverty through the following investment priorities: \uf0b7 (9i). Active inclusion; \uf0b7 (9ii). Integration of marginalised communities, such as the Roma community; \uf0b7 (9iii). Combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation; \uf0b7 (9iv). Enhancing access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services, including health care and social services of general interest; \uf0b7 (9v). Promoting the social economy and social enterprises; \uf0b7 (9vi). Community-led local development strategies. The remainder of this chapter further assesses how the ESF contributed to each of these investment priorities. It assess the progress in implementation and presents the explanations and justifications for lack of implementation in MS. This allows a better understanding of the current contribution of the ESF to the main EU policy objectives. 8.2.1 IP9i. Active inclusion Most operations under IP 9i relate to reducing barriers to employment and integration for groups at the margins of the labour market, or those at risk of poverty and social exclusion; these groups are closely related to the IPs falling under TO8. Operations support pathways to employment, including integrated individualised approaches (combining needs assessments / diagnosis, individual counselling, accreditation of prior learning and working experience, basic education, training, work experience places, job counselling, anti-discrimination measures and information / awareness raising activities, hiring support for companies, job coaching/ support on the work floor). The factsheet below shows considerable progress of operations that seek active inclusion, both in terms of project selection rates (39.4% at EU level), number of participations (1.6 million) and individual results achieved. The highest levels of implementation (in terms of output target achievement and project selection rates) can be found in BE, DE, GR, FR and NL. Many regional German OP note that the achievements of projects exceed targets. In North Rhine Westphalia, some assigned projects were even excluded from the measured indicator to avoid that the values reported would become too high (several times the target value). In NL a substantial number of participants were reached and an evaluation of the program concludes that the first results were promising. However, the evaluation also underlines that operations started only recently and consolidated data on results are not available at this stage. More robust findings will become available during the programme period. At the same time CY and MT do not report eligible costs yet. No work has started in CY, and MT cites delays brought about by a lengthy project evaluation/approval process as well as difficulties in the capacity of the different stakeholders, particularly due to the concurrent closure of the 2007-2013 programming period and the start in the implementation of the new Operational Programme. BG, HR, and HU do report eligible costs yet no participations. Due to staffing issues at the MA, these MS started the work, but have not yet entered this into SFC. Despite evident delays in 2016, HR expects to accelerate the procedures and expedite contracting from the beginning of 2017. In HU, fixed-term contracts at the administrative ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 88 bodies have been converted into contracts of indefinite duration and have been extended for a longer period of time than in the past to deal with the shortage of staffing. High project selection rates in combination with lower numbers of participations were recorded in CZ, EE, IE, LT, LU, LV, and UK. In CZ, the achieved values of the supported persons are currently reported at a lower level than the actual figure, because an ongoing project to correctly transfer the data into the rights system is still starting up. The low take- up in LU is related to a deliberately narrow target group; it aims at people far from the labour market, such as drug addicts, former prisoners, young offenders, economic and / or political refugees and people suffering from mental health issues. The individual results reported so far are modest if we do not include FR, which is responsible for over half of all the individual results reported. This is not only reflected in the absolute counts of individual results, but also by the limited result target achievement rates. Table 8.9 shows a large gap between the progress in implementation between more developed and transition regions on one side (44.6% and 44.5% project selection rates respectively) and less developed regions on the other (26%). This is equally reflected in the number of participations, results and target achievement of both.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 89 8.2.2 IP9ii. Integration of marginalised communities Under the heading of active inclusion, various specific investment priorities have been defined. In addition to active inclusion in IP9i, a second investment priority focuses more broadly on the socio-economic integration of marginalised communities. Operations in this investment priority address the improvement and accessibility in educational provision (including measures to strengthen methods and teachers on inclusion), as well as improving employment, social and health services, and housing, along with reducing existing segregation practices. In this regard, BG, CZ, HU and SK received the recommendation to focus specifically on the Roma community by increasing participation in education. Similarly, actions to improve the prospects of people with a migrant background, by taking measures to improve vocational training and increase labour market participation are also relevant here. Note the incorrectly eligible costs for FI and LT, even though no allocated budget, nor participations are recorded for this IP. BG, CZ, HU, RO and SK are the MS that allocated most budgets to this IP. However, implementation in these MS is falling behind, with project selection rates of 15.5%, 13.8%, 4.3%, 0% and 0% respectively. This becomes even clearer when looking at the participations achieved and project selection rates reached at the level of different regions. Less developed regions, with an allocated budget tenfold of that in more developed regions report roughly the same eligible costs in absolute terms, while the differences in reported participations and results in absolute terms are even bigger. The same reasons are given as for various other IP. Staffing issues at MA, delays in the launching of project calls and in the evaluation of proposals all take their toll. In BG, 2016 has been the year of evaluating project proposals under this IP, and implementation is expected to start in 2017.

Combating discrimination Investment priority 9iii offers another form in which MS can improve the position of vulnerable groups and promote equal opportunities. It addresses actions supporting the promotion of equal opportunities and fighting all types of discrimination by supporting entities in charge, combatting discrimination and developing awareness-raising programmes and training amongst a variety of stakeholders. While 11 MS have included operations under this priority, the budgets allocated are also the lowest in comparison to the other IP under TO9 (\u20ac552 million). This suggests that MS seek to link discrimination issues to other operations, such as for the labour market or education. Projects targeting discrimination can therefore be found across various IP. Note the incorrectly reported costs for FI, while no allocated budgets nor participations are recorded for this IP. Table 8.11 below shows that the implementation across regions is relatively balanced, even though considerably higher number of participations were reported in more developed regions (mainly ES - Madrid) than in any other region.

Where broader actions to prevent discrimination are reported, these often refer to the development of specific criteria for project selection to prevent discrimination. In these cases, project proposals can win more points depending on how these include a view to prevent discrimination; in some cases these principles are formulated as mandatory criteria that need to be satisfied in order to implement projects. In addition, MS report the development of additional guidance material for project promotors to integrate non-discrimination principles in project conception and implementation (PL, SI, HR, CZ), and additional measures to ensure communication material is also accessible to people with disabilities. ES and GR allocated the most substantial budgets to this priority, while other MS allocated minor investments (BE, CY, CZ, DE, FR, IE, PL, PT). No participations are reported yet in BE, CY, CZ, FR, PL and PT, which shows that most of the actual implementation still has to pick up steam. BE is an example of a MS with a modest budget; it supported a \"Gender-and-ICT\" project in schools, which aims to combat gender discrimination and combat the prejudices and stereotypes that persons may encounter in IT and the IT labour market. BE does not provide explanations for its project selection rate of 142.5%. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 92 In ES, limited eligible costs are reported, but a considerable number of participations are already reported (16 302). Similar operations are planned across various regions, and most currently reported participants are in the community of Madrid. The project address people with a migrant background, and people with disabilities. While achievements are relatively modest (2 082), it is one of the few regions (or MS) where participations and results have been reported for actions combating discrimination. In GR, the measure under this focuses primarily on education, and consists of support measures to implement specialised educational support for the integration of pupils with disabilities and / or special educational needs. Due to this specific character, the number of participations are by definition considerably lower. For the school year 2016-2017, the action started on time, except that the declaration of expenditure relating to September-December 2016 was not reported. Separately from this educational support, GR also supports the establishment and running of community centres for the Roma community, which will start operations in 2017. By the end of 2016, the recruitment process of staff was concluded. On the basis of the figures for the integrated operations, it is estimated that these centres will reach out to roughly 7 500 beneficiaries. 8.2.4 IP9iv. Enhancing access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services Under IP9iv, MS can set up operations that seek to enhance access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services, including health care and social services of general interest. These operations mostly support actions for entities (social service providers in the field of education, employment, healthcare, and others) adjusting their policies, working arrangements, and developing programmes, tools and instruments. In a limited number of cases, actions are supported that are directly related to individuals. Table 8.12 shows that considerable budgets have been allocated to this priority in many MS, though predominantly by MS with less developed regions within their territory. Implementation seems to be doing well in BG, EE, LV, and SK. In BG, it is one of the most productive IP, with ongoing projects aimed at facilitating access to health services and community social services for the social inclusion of people with disabilities. BG also reports on progress being made on reducing the number of children and young people placed in institutions by providing social and health services in the community. Various additional projects are still planned for 2017. SK launched a 2016 project focused on the implementation of measures for the social protection of children, and for the effective re-socialisation of drug users. LV instead concentrates its operations on access to health promotion and disease prevention services, in particular for people at risk of territorial, poverty and social exclusion, at national and regional level. ESF facilitated the training of doctors, the attraction of doctors to the regions. By the end of 2016, no progress has been reported by FR, MT and RO. While the budgets for FR and MT are relatively small, RO has a substantial investment allocated to this priority. RO foresees the training of personnel to implement priority health programmes, but the call for proposals has not been concluded at this stage. Only limited progress can be observed by ES, HR, IT, PL, PT, SI. In IT, implementation across all regions is relatively limited in relation to the targets set. MA report that the innovative nature of the planned operations require a considerable organisational effort in preparation, thus leading to longer implementation. In PT, various types of projects are still awaiting national guidance (on regulation and policy priorities) before these will be launched in the various regions. As a result, PT is considering to revising its targets in the PF to reflect the delays in the early implementation of the program. ",

Progress towards implementation targets is generally lower under this thematic objective than under TO8, not only for individuals as presented in the table, but also for the other indicators, many of which still report implementation values of 0%. The implementation of IP9ii and IP9v continue to require considerable attention in the coming years, as these are relatively significant in financial terms, and do not yet show comfortable levels of implementation. More reassuring is that IP9i - which is much more financially significant than other IP - has already been able to produce observable results against the EU objectives to reduce poverty. At the individual level, IP 9i has already reached 1.6 million individuals, among which 415 295 have achieved positive results within weeks after leaving the intervention. As various MS also report ongoing operations, a monitoring report such as this one is not able to fully capture all possible results. Reaching a total of 415 295 individual short-term results under active inclusion already constitutes a modest contribution to the poverty reduction targets. However, particularly for IP9i, the large implementation gap between less developed regions and more developed and transition regions poses considerable risks. However, because the headline target under TO9 is not exclusively focused on less developed regions, and requires a considerable effort also in more developed regions, this gap does not necessarily pose a risk to reaching the headline target (in contrast to TO8).

When assessing the performance of MS in relation to early school leaving 50 in the field of education, one sees that a number of countries already reached their targets, such as LV, NL, FI, SI, BE, FR, HR, IE, IT, CY, AT, DK, GR, LT, and LU (see figure below). Another group of MS is made up of countries that are close to reaching their targets, such as EE, SK, CZ, and PL.

Figure 8.3 Headline target Early School Leaving \u2013 distance from national target (in percentage points) Source: Eurostat (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/europe-2020-indicators) Likewise, by taking a closer look at countries\u2019 performance and national targets on tertiary educational attainment for the 30-34 age group, one sees a group of countries that have already reached their national targets (IT, CZ, AT, FI, SI, EE, NL, SE, CY, DK, LV, LT, GR); a second, larger group is close to reaching their national target. In LU, DE, SK, IE, FR, HR and PT a considerably increase in educational attainment is still needed, as they are more than 5 percentage points from their national target 52 . 50 Early School Leaving is defined by the percentage of the population aged 18-24 with, at most, lower secondary education and who are not in further education or training; 51 For the UK no target has been included in Eurostat concerning this target 52 For the UK no target has been included in Eurostat concerning this target.

ESF 2014-2020 concentrates investments in education into the following four investment priorities: \uf0b7 (10i). Reducing and preventing early school-leaving and promoting equal access to good quality early-childhood, primary and secondary education including formal, non-formal and informal learning pathways for reintegrating into education and training \uf0b7 (10ii). Improving the quality and efficiency of, and access to, tertiary and equivalent education with a view to increasing participation and attainment levels, especially for disadvantaged groups \uf0b7 (10iii). Enhancing equal access to lifelong learning for all age groups in formal, non-formal and informal settings, upgrading the knowledge, skills and competences of the workforce, and promoting flexible learning pathways, including through career guidance and validation of acquired competences \uf0b7 (10iv). Improving the labour market relevance of education and training systems, facilitating the transition from education to work, and strengthening vocational education and training systems and their quality, including through mechanisms for skills anticipation, adaptation of curricula and the establishment and development of work-based learning systems, including dual learning systems and apprenticeship schemes The remainder of this chapter further assesses how the ESF contributed to each of these investment priorities. It assess the progress in implementation and presents the explanations and justifications for lack of implementation in MS. This allows a better understanding of the current contribution of the ESF to the main EU policy objectives. 8.3.1 IP10i. Reducing and preventing early school-leaving Investment priority 10i combines various types of actions and operations under one priority. It focuses on the reduction and prevention of early school-leaving, and also includes the promotion of equal access to good quality early-childhood education, primary and secondary education including formal, non-formal and informal learning pathways to support reintegration. The overwhelming majority of targets consist of young people in education. Other frequently targeted groups are schools, low skilled individuals and school personnel. As the other investment priorities in this TO, most MS have allocated considerable budgets to this priority. In various MS, project selection rates have reached above 50% (BG, EE, GR, HU, ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 99 LV). In these MS no specific issues for implementation are being reported. However in a number of larger programmes, the project selection rates have a negative effect on the overall project selection (CZ, IT, PL, PT). In CZ, the first calls were launched in 2016, but no participations are yet recorded. In 2017, some strategic calls will be announced and evaluated, which may have a significant impact on the target values of some indicators. Still, CZ is considering an overall revision of target indicator values for all priority axes by the end of 2018. IT did already report considerable number of participations in early school leaving projects; however these tend to focus on a small number of regions. In Campania, implementation is well underway and focuses on increasing the attractiveness and success factors of formal education processes, for instance by supporting measures to carry out a variety of cultural, social, artistic and sporting initiatives directed at children and their families, involving associations, training structures, professionals, experts and agencies. Other measures supported transition from training to work. Similar approaches are applied in other regions in IT; in Sardinia operations are first addressing the main reasons for school drop-out, after which later in the OP a focus on innovative didactic approaches will be pursued. In other regions, much work has been internally in terms of strategic and administrative documents. Towards the end of 2016 more projects were being launched, but are currently not reported upon. In PT, considerably higher numbers of participations are being reported in the AIR than what is currently presented in SFC. However, no explanation for such differences is provided. Based on an assessment of the combination of project selection rates, participations and individual results, AT, DE, ES and FR also seem well underway. AT for instance reports the implementation of various ESL measures across the country with a focus on vocational orientation and vocational training as well as on improving employability (\"pre-employment\") for young people with disabilities, impairment and deprivation. In BG, CZ, GR, HU, MT, RO and SK no participations, nor results have been recorded so far; this suggests that in the next years the number of participations and results is likely to increase substantially. In GR, no participations are recorded in terms of the common indicators, but in fact progress has been rather well. In every schoolyear since 2014, annual waves of projects have been implemented. In RO, no calls have been launched in 2016. To better facilitate implementation in the coming years, RO changed the methodology for the verification, evaluation, and selection of projects. By removing restrictive eligibility criteria the number of quality projects submitted is expected to increase in the next years. Note how FI reports costs, while neither allocated budgets, nor participations are recorded (refer to Annex II/III for more details). The figures suggest that implementation is considerably better in transition and more developed regions than in less developed regions; the former show substantially higher project selection rates, in combination with better target achievements and individual results. Less developed regions do report a higher number of participations; given the lack of progress in other indicators, the number of participations in these regions can be expected to rise substantially in the coming years.

Improving the quality and efficiency of tertiary education A second crucial headline target of Europe 2020 extends to the share of population that is enrolled in tertiary education. Investments towards this target are categorised under IP10ii. The objective of this priority is to improve the quality and efficiency of, and access to, tertiary and equivalent education with a view to increasing participation and attainment levels, especially for disadvantaged groups. As such, it brings together various aspects in the sphere of education, but also elements that may be targeted under Thematic Objective 9, under fighting against discrimination and promoting equal opportunities. The table clearly shows the importance that most MS award to this priority, with over 6.6 billion euros allocated for 2014- 2020. ",

It is well underway in DE, IE, IT, LT, MT and PT. In MT, the AIR reports that implementation is well underway in the area of education. Projects are supported that contribute to quality tertiary education in order to ensure that the Maltese labour market is supplied with the right individuals and to guarantee that it is in a better position to compete at an international level. Note how FI and UK report costs, while no allocated budgets, nor participations are recorded (see annex II/III for more details on inconsitencies). PT reports a broad range of projects that supports the promotion of access to higher education; a key approach to improving the levels of attendance and completion of higher education is through a system of loans for students of higher education. More limited progress so far can be found in CZ, ES and PL. CZ worries that reaching the PF milestones will be difficult, and considers changing these. By the end of 2016, a new set of calls was launched, but these have not yet been reported; CZ cannot foresee whether these projects may reduce such worries in the next year. ES does not provide specific reasons for it low project selection rates and participations at the national level; individual communities general point to the difficulties of designating the authorities in the early phase of the programme. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 102 No participations are recorded yet for BG, FR, HR, HU, LV, RO, and SK, while only SK does not report any costs thus far. In SK, calls for projects were launched at the end of 2016, aimed at enhancing the inclusion of education. SK expects the fulfilment of the indicators from 2017 onwards. In FR, various regions already report approved projects and new calls for proposals. In HR, throughout 2016 the work had focused on meeting ex-ante conditionalities, now that these have been formally accepted by the end of 2016, implementation of projects and the approval of claims for funds will be intensified over the next years; from the beginning of 2017, HR notes an acceleration of procedures. LV reports minimal progress under this IP, and identified a high risk of not meeting the milestones set in the PF for 2018. Therefore, changes to the financial performance targets in the PF are considered. Still, LV plans to launch all HE projects supported by ESF in 2017, which should contribute to meeting the requirements of the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR) agency, including improving the quality of the agency's activities and strengthening its capacity. Also for this IP, the implementation data suggests a widening gap in implementation between less developed regions, and more developed and transition region, though less extreme than in IP10i. 8.3.3 IP10iii. Enhancing equal access to lifelong learning Where IP 10i focuses on general education and IP10ii on higher education, IP10iii includes operations that seek to improve quality and access to lifelong learning, including for all age groups in formal, non-formal and informal settings. It should contribute to upgrading the knowledge, skills and competences of the workforce, and promoting flexible learning pathways, including career guidance and validation of acquired competences. First of all, the outlier target output achievement rate at EU level, and more specifically in transition regions is caused by an incorrect data entry in MT. MT reports that SFC data validation rules required it to follow the measurement unit of the result indicator; it now reports 22 457 hours instead of 16 number of doctorates). However, it has not adjusted its target indicator, still checks progress against the target of 10 (post-doctoral candidates). Overall, this IP has achieved one of the highest project selection rates, with an average of 39.8%. These high project selection rates are matched by equally well advancing participations and results, even though the target achievement rates suggest considerably higher number in the near future. Most progress thus far is recorded in BE, EE, IE, LU, SI and UK. In BE, numerous activities are reported in its various OP: promotion of technical professions, qualifying training, work-linked training, distance learning, validation of skills, lifelong learning, training and updating of trainers' knowledge, sector support and actors in the socio-professional integration sector, and design of training modules. The economic and social situation in 2016 in BE has demonstrated the usefulness of the measures taken to enhance the experience gained and retraining in order to reduce the impact on employment of collective redundancies. No participations or results are reported as of yet in BG, CY, LV, RO, and SK. In SK, by the end of 2016 a call has been launched aimed at promoting lifelong learning; it is expected that this will result in reporting of indicators from 2017 onwards. In CY, no projects had started in 2016; currently public procurement project have been launched, which are currently in the preparatory phase of implementation. CY underlines the need to start as soon as possible in order to meet the milestone performance targets in 2018. In LV, which already shows a high project selection rate, work was started to ensure the development of individual competences and talents of general education learners, providing a national and international scale support package for learners, which is planned to be implemented in at least 200 general education institutions.

Improving the labour market relevance of education Under this heading, MS can undertake operations that improve the overall education and training systems, improve the transition from education to work, and strengthen vocational education and training systems and their quality. This can be carried out through mechanisms for skills anticipation, adaptation of curricula and the establishment and development of work- based learning systems, including dual learning systems and apprenticeship schemes. Target groups range from schools, low skilled individuals and school personnel and also include enterprises (employers, companies, and organisations). For FI, the eligible costs reported under this priority are considerably higher that the allocated budget, which is probably caused by the incorrect allocation of costs (as shown across practically all IPs. Implementation of operations in this IP is already high in DE, and PT.

Specifically under this IP, there are considerable differences between progress in implementation in less developed regions and more developed and transition regions. Such differences are relevant to monitor in the coming years, as ESL figures tend to be consistently higher in less developed regions as well. To prevent that ESF has a negative effect on social and economic cohesion in the Union (more investments and projects to MS that less need it), implementation of ESF projects between the different types of regions needs to be more balanced. Differences in implementation between types of regions are less pronounced, or even in favour of less developed regions in the other three IP under TO10. However, in these cases the headline targets set are also targeting a more mixed variety of types of regions. The second headline targets aim to increase the attainment levels for tertiary education. For this headline target, operations under IP10ii are particularly relevant, as this IP is dedicated to increasing access to higher education. This IP shows however the lowest project selection rates and participation within TO10, which are also relatively low in a comparative context of other thematic objectives. The low number of individual short-term results is a reflection of the more structural nature of operations and is therefore not necessarily reason for concern. Operations under this investment priority may not directly succeed in directing individuals into higher education, but rather contribute to a favourable environment, in which higher attainment level of tertiary education is made possible. Project selection rates, participations recorded and results are relatively high in IP10iii and IP10iv specifically. Though not captured in EU Headline targets, these IP contribute to central priorities in European education polies. In total, 1.9 million participations are recorded for all operations with an education objective, of which 578 272 have reached an individual short term result. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 106 8.4 Thematic Objective 11: Enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration Good public administration significantly impacts the economic environment. Therefore, reforming public administrations is a key priority for the successful implementation of the EU2020 Strategy towards smart and sustainable growth. The Annual Growth Survey 2013, the Economic Adjustment Programmes and other frameworks of Financial Assistance in EU Member States highlighted the need to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, as well as the transparency and quality of public administration and the judiciary. \u201cEnhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and an efficient public administration\u201d is included as a separate thematic objective (thematic objective 11 or \"TO11\") in the Common Provisions Regulation for the 2014-2020 programming period (Regulation (EU) 1303/2013, Art.9). Both the ESF and ERDF contribute to TO11, but their role is quite different. ERDF has a relatively narrow scope on infrastructure, while ESF focuses more on the (staff of the) institutions and procedures. To contribute to these objectives, 2 specific IP have been defined within the ESF: \uf0b7 (11i). Investment in institutional capacity and in the efficiency of public administrations and public services at the national, regional and local levels with a view to reforms, better regulation and good governance \uf0b7 (11ii). Capacity building for all stakeholders delivering education, lifelong learning, training and employment and social policies, including through sectoral and territorial pacts to mobilise for reform at the national, regional and local levels. 8.4.1 IP11i. Investment in institutional capacity Under this IP, MS can programme a variety of operations that contribute to institutional capacity. Operations can target different levels of government, and in majority tend to consist of training measures. Within the specific objectives of IP, measures aim at adapting structures, streamlining processes implementation of evidence-based public policies, preparing strategic planning with program budgeting, simplifying legislation and reducing administrative burdens, strengthening the capacity of public authorities and institutions for transparent and effective implementation of public procurement as well as improving the efficiency of the judiciary. In 2014-2020 a total of \u20ac4.5 billion has been allocated to this priority. Currently, the project selection rate stands at 28%, and implementation is well underway in CZ, EE, GR, LV, and SI. In EE for instance, overall progress is considered good. The professional competence has increased in the general government, and the increase in management capacity for performance indicators is expected to be met. SI reports that its activities under this IP are taking place smoothly. In 2016, public procurement and signing procedures started, and considerable share of payments from the state budget were already realised. The operations aim to improve governance and increase transparency in public administration by introducing new tools, methods and interoperable solutions. A number of MS do already report eligible costs, but do not report participations; HU, PT, RO. In HU, various concrete projects have been under preparation in 2016 (preparing feasibility studies, the technical and professional content for procurement, more detailed specification of the project, actual preparation of the public procurement), but have not formally started. In RO, by the end of 2016, considerable progress is reported in the AIR, even though no formal data has been entered in SFC. Monthly Progress Reports are submitted by beneficiaries, in which the status of training activities are updated. However, so far no requests for reimbursement of the related costs have been received. Given that data is already available only for some indicators, RO plans to update the value for 2016 in the 2017 report. No progress has been reported in this IP in CY, FR, HR, MT, and SK. In CY, a large number of project proposals were received over the course of 2016, which will be implemented soon. French operations in this IP relate to overseas territories, where the implementation of the ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 107 training programmes needs to be coordinated with the local training plans. None of the French OP include an estimate of when implementation is expected to start. HR has currently no active projects yet; implementation was pending the formal approval of meeting the ex ante conditionalities. MT has formally issued the first call for proposals at the end of 2016, but so far has no active projects. Finally, in SK, no progress has been achieved yet, though two projects were recently launched to be implemented in 2017.

This even includes a number of (small) inconsistencies that on this scale end up having a substantial contribution; FI reported costs of 4.6 million (25% of the total costs reported), even though it has no investments allocated and no activities planned under this objective. FR also reports inconsistently higher costs than the total budget allocated. The only meaningful implementation in this IP can be found in FR and SI. In FR (Guyane), the programming had started to support training networks, which it considers high-value-added operations. Implementation is scheduled for 2017, and the region is confident about its ability to meet targets of the performance framework. In SI, implementation is on schedule; in 2016 contracts were signed for 17 projects: 9 of them in the Western Cohesion region and 8 in the east. All the other MS indicate that implementation is not scheduled to start before 2017. CY particularly reflects on this situation as no concern, as the planned training actions are of a low degree of difficulty and the target group (partners involved in the preparation of the OP) is already defined. Consequently, there is no risk for not meeting the target values. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 109 8.4.3 Overview TO11 This section presented progress in implementation of the operations under IP11i and IP11ii. Implementation is comparatively low, though IP11i has made a considerable improvement in comparison to last year. Unlike other ESF priorities, assessing implementation progress of operations in the area of institutional capacity by the number of individuals reached is not the most insightful, as these are not the main units targeted by these operations. However, as other common indicators also show limited progress across, these are still included in the table below.

To ensure integration of the gender perspective in OP and in specific operations, all MS indicate that the gender perspective is integrated horizontally in their programmes as well. Also MS without dedicated budgets to IP8iv have integrated a gender perspective in ESF projects by defining specific criteria to ensure gender equality in project selection (BE, BG, CY, FR, HR, LT, LV, MT, SE, SI), or define specific gender equality criteria for project evaluation (CY, FR, HR, IE, LT, LU, MT, RO, SE, SI). Some MS report specific additional training measures for staff within the MA (DE, EE, ES, GR, NL, IT, PL, SE, UK), or targeted support to beneficiaries to sufficiently integrate a gender equality perspective in projects (AT, CZ, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, HR, IT, LU, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SE, SI, UK). Such targeted support can range from information provided on a website to detailed handbooks and guidelines on gender equality, but may equally consist of various forms of training and participatory approaches to project development in which specific attention is paid to gender equality. To further stimulate beneficiaries to include a gender perspective into ESF projects, in some MS specific positive incentives are offered to project promotors that offer an innovative approach to integrate the gender perspective (AT, ES, FR, IT, LU, MT, PL, UK). In FR for instance, projects that target gender equality and discrimination specifically are exempt from other requirements. A number of MS also mention to award prizes to projects that have a particular focus on gender equality and combating discrimination (UK, ES, IT). Finally, MA also report the steps taken in avoiding gender bias in communication material on ESF projects (BG, DE, ES, FI, FR, GR, HU, IT, NL, PL, PT). 8.5.2 Actions directed at target groups at highest risk of poverty discrimination or social exclusion Article 111(4) of the CPR specifically foresees that \u2013 depending on the objectives of the OP \u2013 the AIR2016 contains reports on progress of measures that address the specific needs of target groups at the highest risk of poverty discrimination or social exclusion. Most MS do report on such progress; only IE, NL and LT do not report information in their AIR about progress of such measures. In all other MS, ongoing operations are reported directed at target groups at the highest risk of poverty discrimination or social exclusion. Often, MS specifically identify which target groups are addressed with such additional attention; only in DK, IE, NL and LT no specific target groups are identified. To get a better understanding of what target groups are considered as those at highest risk of poverty discrimination or social exclusion, these target groups are summarised below. When MS do not refer to a certain target group ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 110 in this respect, does not mean that these target groups are not addressed in their ESF programmes. Instead, target groups mentioned here are those at the highest risk of poverty discrimination or social exclusion and therefore receive additional attention, particularly by operations under TO9. Even though various MS specifically mention various target groups, some patterns can be observed. Table 8.24 below shows clearly how in 22 MS persons from a disadvantaged background are specifically targeted with additional measures. Such disadvantages can derive from limited (formal) education and / or skills or disadvantaged in a socio-economic sense. There are also a considerable number of MS that have set up specific operations for persons with disabilities (17). The table shows considerable overlap in the MS that target unemployed in general (15MS) and young persons specifically (14 MS). Only CY, FI, and LV target the unemployed and do not also specifically target young people, while MT and UK target young people while not specifically targeting the unemployed. Persons with an immigration background are targeted by roughly half of the MS (13MS). A slightly lower number of MS report specific actions to older persons (10MS), the homeless (9MS), women (9MS), people with a criminal background (7MS), difficult family situation (7MS), or members of the Roma community (7MS). A more select group of MS chose to set up specific anti-poverty measures for people in precarious employment situations (CY, FR, GR, IT). Table 8.24 Overview target groups identified in AIR Type of target group Number of MS Overview Persons with disadvantaged background (low education, limited skills, socio-economic situation) 22 AT, BE, BG, CY, CZ, DE, EE, ES FI, FR, GR, HR, HU, IT, LU, LV, MT, PL, PT, RO, SK, UK Person with (some kind of) physical / mental disability 17 BG, CY, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, HR, HU, IT, LU, LV, MT, PL, SK, UK (long-term) Unemployed 15 BG, CY, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, HR, IT, LV, PL, PT, SE, SI Young persons 14 BG, DE, EE, ES, FR, GR, HR, IT MT, PL, PT, SE, SI, SK, UK Immigrants / persons with immigration background 13 BE, BG, CY, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR GR, IT, PL, PT, SE Older persons 10 BG, DE, ES, FR, GR, HR, IT, PL, PT, UK Homeless 9 AT, CY, ES, FR, GR, HR, HU, IT, PL Women 9 DE, ES, FR, GR, HR, HU, IT, PL, UK Criminal background 7 CY, CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT, UK Persons in difficult family situation 7 CY, DE, ES, GR, IT, PL, UK Roma 7 BE, BG, ES, GR, HU, IT, RO Employee (low salary / at risk of unemployment) 4 CY, FR, GR, IT Source: AIR2016 8.5.3 Integrated approach to territorial development In AIR 2016, MS are requested to report on the specific actions taken in the integrated approach to territorial development, as part of community led local development under the operational programme. A number of MS that did not select this investment priority in their OP also do not report any activities under this heading (AT, CY, DK, EE, FI, IE, LU, MT, SI). There are also a number of MS that have not selected this investment priority for ESF funds, yet are implementing a territorial strategy with ERDF and / or national resources (BE, BG, LV, NL, SK). In view of the limited project selection reported by MS, it is remarkable that many MS indicate explicitly in their AIR ongoing or already concluded operations with a integrated approach to territorial development (BE, BG, CZ, DE, ES, FR, GR, HR, HU, IT, LT, LV, NL, PL, PT, RO, SE, SK, UK). However, these are not programmed to be a part of this investment priority: BG, LV, SI refer to operations with a community-led local development component, yet have no investments allocated to this particular IP. It is therefore concluded here that the integrated approach to territorial development depends mostly on ERDF, while ESF plays only a minor role. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 111 8.5.4 Social innovation Social innovation is defined as the development of new ideas, services and models to better address social issues. It is part of the social investment package, and the EC provides targeted support to test the design and potential for the scaling up of innovative structural reforms in welfare systems policies through the programme for employment and social innovation (EaSI). Most importantly, article 9 of the ESF Regulation introduces Social Innovation as a horizontal principle that should be embedded in ESF programming and implementation and connected to the social priorities defined. Social innovation can be supported in all areas falling under the scope of the ESF. In AIR 2016, MS are requested to report on progress of activities, where relevant, under the heading of Social Innovation. In the AIR MS do not always clearly explain how social innovation is/has been supported. In some MS for instance, no reference is made in the AIR or progress report on how social innovation has been taken into account by the OP. In other MS, social innovation is not linked to specific operations, but presented as a cross-cutting component affecting all operations in the OP (eg ES, UK, SE). In UK and SE, evaluations of ESF operations are specifically tasked to also include social innovation as a relevant component of an operation\u2019s success. Other MS specifically indicate how ESF supported the testing / evaluation of innovative solutions with a social dimension. In BG for instance, innovative projects for the adaptation of the workforce to changing requirements regarding skills and competencies are being tested and further developed. In CZ, there are actions and policies in various fields (quality of public services and social inclusion) that are being tested through the support of the ESF. German OPs report that often ESF operations are based on long-standing and established operations that are concentrated on implementing specific measures, thus leaving little room for innovation. Therefore, specific calls for projects that foster innovative approaches are planned; a pilot project offers comprehensive support for the integration of refugees into the labour market (bringing together Chambers of commerce, the public employment service and other partners such as migrant organisations and social service organisations); once effectiveness is tested, the action can be continued and scaled up (or expanded to support for instance refugees from specific backgrounds, languages, , etc.). Under the heading of social innovation, FI has funded an innovative decentralised youth project, which has attracted international attention. The French national YEI programme supports different approaches to engage NEETs in different regions; an evaluation of the results of these approaches can further inform policymaking thus contributing to social innovation. In most Greek OP, social inclusion operations have been defined as social innovation projects; such innovation approach seeks to develop new responses to today\u2019s most pressing social problems. In IT (Abruzzo), ESF introduced a new way of managing social services through so-called social districts, which is conducive for a more participatory development of social policies 53 . Both LT and LU report that they reserve national resources to continue successful ESF operations. In SI and SK, AIR report that Social innovation goes in the direction of strengthening the local dimension, not only to promote effective implementation of the project, but also to ensure that the projects reach a broader geographical target. 8.5.5 Transnational cooperation Transnational cooperation in the ESF mostly promotes the exchange and sharing of information and good practice across national borders, and working together towards common solutions by bringing together administrations, social partners and non-governmental organisations in the policy fields of relevance for the ESF 54 . Under article 10 of the ESF Regulation, transnational cooperation is a mandatory element for the ESF, though only applied at the MS level (so it is not mandatory for individual operational programmes) 55 . In AIR 2016, 53 2014IT05SFOP009 54 European Commission (2016), Transnational cooperation in the ESF 2014-2020: an introductory guide. 55 Note that in duly justified cases, MS may exceptionally choose not to support transnational cooperation actions. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 112 MS are requested to report on progress of activities under the heading of transnational cooperation. This section provides a main overview of these progress reports on transnational activities. It is recalled that MS are not asked to report on these activities in fixed template and as a result the descriptions vary largely from detailed description to merely a few basic remarks. While MS are formally requested to report on progress of transnational activities, most MS tend to limit themselves to descriptions of ongoing operations, which does not always allow a full and consistent assessment of progress. Neither do the MS descriptions allow to map the full range of transnational activities funded by ESF; a majority of the 187 AIR highlight a number of illustrative transnational projects, while only a few aim to tend to offer a complete account of all transnational activities. An assessment of the 187 AIR also shows that it is difficult to isolate transnational activities funded by ESF from other transnational activities. Often, MS report on transnational activities with social objectives, which are not necessarily funded by ESF, but by other ESI funds without specifically identifying which. Some MS do no report at all on ESF transnational actions, or to what extent progress has been reached. AT, CY, DK, EE, IE, LT, LV, and RO do not report any actions or progress on transnational cooperation with ESF funds. However, various other MS mention interactions with some of these MS, which shows that this does not necessarily mean that no transnational activities take place. To encourage and facilitate transnational activity in ESF, the 2014-2020 programme period introduced a common framework, in which MA and IB have the option to collaborate in an institutionalised EU level forum around a number of common themes. In 2016, most of these networks around common themes have focused on making first contacts, exchanging basic information and discussing possible work plans. Only a limited number of transnational calls for proposal were launched within the common framework (SE, FI, BE, and PL). BE complains about the general lack of interest among MS to set up transnational actions under the framework, despite the fact that such are made mandatory by the ESF Regulation. Rather than within the common framework, most MS report on transnational activities under the flexible approach, with a dominant focus on mutual learning. Under this flexible approach, project promotors do not have to comply with the common framework, and allows MA to coordinate directly among themselves. Even though this gives the flexibility to set up transnational activities independently, some MS underline the added value of an institutional structure provided by the common framework. In this regard, MT for instance points to the difficulties for project promotors that have not yet established an international network of contacts to engage in transnational projects. In the area of labour market policies for instance, the Youth Employment Network has supported study visits in participating MS (SE, FI, EE, LT and PL). Other professional exchanges under this objective are also reported by HU, ES and SE; these MS report several transnational exchanges of PES staff. DE also specifically reports an exchange programme with IT, where staff at labour market institutions learned from each other in offering tailored support to reintegration of former prisoners. In addition to such exchanges between project promotors, MS also mention transnational activities and international training for young people and long-term unemployed (DE), and projects implementing EURES (HU, SI). In the area of social inclusion, DE reports on its participation in a transnational network for professionals with a focus on disadvantaged youth, in which 15 MS participate to coordinate mobility programmes for NEETs. IT refers to a mobility for diversity programme, offering mobility opportunities for people with disabilities. CZ reports on a project that offers the opportunity to disadvantaged young people to enrol in apprenticeships in DE, MT, PL, UK, and SK. While various examples are mentioned in the two areas mentioned above, most transnational activities mentioned concern mobility programmes for education. Particularly OP in IT often refer to elements of Erasmus+ as examples of transnational activities, complemented with specific vouchers or other types of scholarships for students, teachers and researchers to engage in international summer programmes, or entire school years abroad. In addition to individual exchanges, also institutional exchanges are included. Another project in IT foresees ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 113 contributions to schools for the implementation of a study visit in Italy or in other EU countries to support the exchange of ideas and practices in vocational or training. Also with regard to institutional capacity building, various transnational activities are reported. In BG for instance, short term traineeships are offered to staff working in Bulgarian Ministries to be temporarily located and trained at EU institutions. Other exchanges between public officials funded by ESF are reported by DE, BG, FI, IT, PL, SE. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 114 9 Conclusions This report has shown that by the end of 2016, in most MS the implementation of ESF 2014- 2020 is well underway, though at a considerably slower pace than the previous programming period (2007-2013). There are various reasons for this, which have been explored throughout the report. Additionally, more specific progress in terms of outputs, results and financial implementation have been compared across MS and types of regions, both for ESF and for YEI investments. This chapter revisits the main explanations and conclusions behind these findings and assesses the importance of ESF in relation to EU policy priorities. Finally, this chapter also presents some key conclusions on the quality of reporting in AIR, mainly from the perspective of inconsistencies encountered. 9.1 Progress in implementation Progress in implementation has been assessed from a variety of angles, and takes the progress reported in terms of outputs, results, financial reporting, each complemented with qualitative assessments by MS. Each of these angles are briefly discussed here. In general, considerable progress has been achieved in comparison to last year\u2019s report based on AIR 2015 for all three angles. Outputs Section 5.1 shows that a total 8.1 million participations have been reported in ESF/YEI operations, of which 7.8 million participations with sufficient background characteristics to analyse. For ESF, the highest participations are recorded in the more developed regions (3.8 million), followed by less developed regions (1.4 million), and transition regions (1.3 million). Operations supported by YEI reached another 1.3 million participations. These participants have various backgrounds, but most participants (54%) were unemployed. In terms of age, 39% of all participants were below 25 years old. Finally, with regard to education level, a considerable level of participants had qualifications at ISCED 1/2 level (44%) 56 . The participation of (wo)men is balanced at EU level. Currently, RO is the only MS that does not yet report on participations in ongoing operations. However, some MS report relatively low numbers, which also suggests that implementation has just started (AT, BG, CY, CZ, DK, EE, HR, LU, MT, SE, SI). In various sections throughout the report (chapter 3 / 8), the provided explanations for this are further assessed. In addition to participations, common outputs are registered for the number of projects and entities. A total of 7 413 projects that targeted social partners or non-governmental organisations were supported, while 5 694 projects were supported that are dedicated to the sustainable participation and progress of women in employment. Another 3 975 projects were targeting public administration / public services at national, regional or local level. ESF supported a total of 197 463 SMEs between 2014-2016. In order to provide an objective measure from which to assess the progress of ESF / YEI implementation, the ESF Regulation introduced the performance framework, in which milestone targets are set for 2018, and a total target value for 2023. On average, BE, MT, DK and NL reached target achievement ratios higher than the (non-financial) Milestone in 2018, though this is largely due to a number of higher achievements in a small number of indicators. FI, LT, GR, BG, ES, FR, EE, IT, and PL have average achievement values towards the milestone that are not necessarily worrying, but in some may need further monitoring. IE, UK, LU, DE, LV, SE, SI, CY, HR, PT, CZ, SK, HU, AT, RO report average achievement rates of below 30%, which is low, given that the milestone needs to be achieved by 2018. Results In terms of results achieved by ESF/YEI by the end of 2016, section 5.1 shows that 617 420 participants found employment, 750 166 gained a qualification, 148 426 participants are engaged in job searching, and 275 478 are in education / training. From these short-term 56 Note that these categories are not mutually exclusive. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 115 results, in total 322 206 disadvantaged participants achieved at least one of these positive results. Common results for ESF operations are significantly more often reported in more developed regions (867 686 short term results achieved), than in transition (419 999 short term results achieved) and less developed regions (363 110 short term results achieved). For the most part this is \u2018only\u2019 related to delays in reporting, but in various MS with less developed regions delays in actual implementation are also a factor. Most MS report increasing number of short-term individual results. However, in CY, LU, and RO, no such common results are reported. Some MS still report very low results, which suggest that the reporting does not yet provide an insight in the implementation of the operations (BG, CZ, DK, HR, LV, NL, SE, SI). Financial costs First of all, section 6.2 shows that the financial progress for ESF as measured by eligible expenditure declared is still relatively low, with \u20ac6.4 billion (5.3% of allocated budget). For YEI, \u20ac1.1 billion (15%) have been reported as eligible expenditures. Except for AT and IE, all MS report at least some eligible expenditures, but these are too low to get a good sense of implementation. This has to do with a variety of difficulties to reporting, such as delays in designating authorities in the first years, migrating data to different information systems, or simply other priorities due to high workloads in all start-up activities of OP. The value for eligible expenditures is comparatively low, also when compared against financial implementation in 2007-2013. In view of this, and the similarly low number of participants reached in 2014-2016 compared to 2007-2008, considerable additional actions remain needed to catch up on the implementation targets set for 2018 and 2023. This report therefore presents in most sections the eligible costs. These form the project selection rate when compared to the allocated budget. Such project selection rates are reported at an earlier stage of implementation and are therefore particularly insightful to assess progress of implementation. At the end of 2016, a total of \u20ac36.8 billion are reported as eligible costs for ESF, which equals 30.6% of the allocated budget. For YEI, \u20ac4.8 billion (62% of allocated budgets) has been reported. All MS report at least some eligible costs, but CY and RO are still relatively low. Both MS report in their AIR that much activity will be reported on in 2017. More broadly speaking, the project selection rates show some relevant different across different types of regions. Less developed regions currently report a project selection rate of 24.8%, while more developed (36.5%) and transition regions (35.8%) are considerably higher. Financial development towards the 2018 milestone has been analysed in section 6.3 and shows that at the EU level an average of 24% of the milestone for 2018 has been entered into the accounting system as eligible expenditure. With three of the five years passed before the deadline for reaching the financial milestone, and assuming linear implementation, we should expect that MS have reached at least 60% of their milestone targets in 2016; however no MS reaches this value (if controlling for incorrect target settings). The eligible expenditures reported in AT, IE, RO, HR, ES, BE, HU, CY are particularly worrying, as these still report less than 10% of their milestone as eligible expenditures. However, when assessed in conjunction with the progress on participation milestones, it is concluded that the delays are not entirely in implementation, but at least to some extent related to delays in reporting. Indeed various MS report in their AIR a backlog of recording administrative data into their accounting systems and estimate that they will be able to compensate this in the next year(s). Recommendation The delays in implementation across the EU, particularly also in comparison to progress of implementation in comparable years in 2007-2013, warrant additional attention of MS and the Commission to monitor the feasibility of meeting the milestone targets in 2018, and revising these where necessary.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 116 9.2 Contribution to the main EU policy objectives This report jointly analyses the objectives established in the Operational Programmes and types of operations funded, from the perspective of the national situation and strategies (as reported in the AIR) and EU level strategies and headline targets. Operations that promote sustainable and quality employment (Thematic Objective 8) have started, though still face considerable growing pains, mainly related to the IP with the smaller allocations. Section 8.1 shows that operations that seek to increase access to the labour market (IP8i) have shown the most stable development in implementation, both in terms of project selection rate (34.2%), number of participations (1.6 million) and the number results for individuals already reached (0.4 million). Since it accounts for 40% of the entire budget in TO8, it is important to highlight that implementation of this key IP is on a relatively steady implementation track. The operations with a focus on integration of youth on the labour market (IP8ii) in general terms are also moving ahead steadily as well, although MS tend to give YEI operations priority over the implementation of ESF-funded employment measures for young persons. In total, 2.8 million participations were recorded for all employment related operations, resulting in 0.6 million short term results for individuals, against an average project selection rate of 29.6%). Given that these numbers represent 3 years of work, these are modest in comparison to the total population of 18.7 million unemployed and the EU headline target for employment. Operations in the field of social inclusion have the potential to contribute to the headline target of reducing poverty in the EU. Section 8.2 presents that such operations are primarily focused around active inclusion (IP9i) and access to affordable services (IP9iv), while in other (smaller) investment priorities considerably less activity can be seen. A total of 1.7 million participations are reported for all social inclusion operations and 0.4 million short term results achieved, against an average project selection rate of 30.8%. This offers a step towards the headline target to lift 20 million out of poverty by 2020. However, given that in 2016, 8.1 million still need to be targeted in ES, FR, GR, and HU alone, it remains at best a \u2018modest\u2019 contribution. Moreover, the AIR monitoring data does not show the extent to which participations would classify as the target groups of the EU headline target for social inclusion. Section 8.3 In the field of education, the implementation of the key investment priorities has recovered well in comparison to last year. By the end of 2015, education operations were off to a slower start, and showed the lowest project selection rates. Currently, these are in comparison (slightly) higher than other TO (on average 31%). At the end of 2016, 1.9 million participations are registered, resulting in 0.6 million short-term results for individuals. Specific IP under TO10 target the EU headline targets specifically and offer complementary funding to national resources. Section 8.4 shows that institutional capacity operations have on average a project selection rate of 27%, and show considerably lower participations (68 987) and results (48 459) than the other thematic objectives. This is natural, given that the scope and target groups are fundamentally different. Across thematic objectives the number of participations, results and project selection rates have developed in a balanced way. However, when assessing the progress across different types of regions, implementation is not so balanced. Less developed regions show considerably less progress in implementation of ESF than more developed regions, particularly in a number of key IP. The current monitoring data provided in AIR 2016 does not suggest that ESF contributes positively to the EU\u2019s broader objective of social and economic cohesion in the Union. Most progress in implementation so far has been recorded in MS that are already closest to their EU Headline targets. At the same time, MS that would benefit most from ESF as instrument to complement national funding towards the headline target, are facing delays in implementation, and as a result limited support to progress against the EU Headline targets. Many MS and regions already indicate the large number of projects and calls for projects that are in the pipeline for 2017. Moreover, most indicate that the most pertinent problems and bottlenecks have been resolved. Possibly, this can help catch up implementation in regions that need it the most, and result in a more balanced implementation of ESF. However, whether this will indeed be the case can only be determined by a new set of monitoring data. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 117 Recommendation The findings give evidence to recommend that the EC and MA need to monitor closely the implementation of ESF/YEI where it is most needed, particularly in areas of higher unemployment and less developed regions. 9.3 Assessing unit costs The unit costs of programmes, both within and across MS and policy themes, are a relevant indicator for monitoring implementation of programmes. This report has shown in chapter 7 how these should not be mistaken as a measure of efficiency, particularly not at this stage of implementation. The reported unit costs are very unstable, because these are distorted by different conventions in reporting on fully and partially implemented operations. In addition, their variability is high due to reporting on participations on outputs and results while not reporting on budgets or vice versa. Still, these values are instructive, exactly because of their volatility; any outlier may be taken to adhere to different report methods than their peers. The difference between the unit costs for operations in less developed regions against other types of regions underlines how the number of participations reported in less developed regions is considerably lower than in more developed / transition regions, against similar levels of declared expenditure. A similar pattern is also found for unit costs per result. However, in these cases such differences may be related due to different types of operations and expected results; in some MS more long-term results may be expected and measured, while others may measure results immediately after the operation. Recommendation Caution should be adopted in using unit costs in mid-term reporting and evaluations, as these are distorted by different reporting practices of MA. It is recommended that the EC does not use these values to map the efficiency of operations, and limits its use to understand whether reporting of progress is proceeding in a balanced way. 9.4 Consistency in reporting Throughout each chapter, a number of consistency checks are presented that bring to light a number of data inconsistencies; the results of each of these checks are presented in Annex III. A number of central inconsistencies in financial allocations that were identified in the synthesis of AIR2015 were resolved in this year\u2019s reporting cycle. Chapter 7 also presented in detail the efforts of MS to meet the requirements of general ex ante conditionality 7. More specifically, MS improved the monitoring system and target setting of indicators considerably in comparison to the situation as reported in AIR2015. However, as the analysis of inconsistencies also show, many inconsistencies persisted. In some cases, such inconsistencies are barely visible in the data analysis, in other cases these distort the tables and figures presented in the report, and in a last category of cases these make a sensible aggregation of data difficult, if not impossible. This last category is most problematic, and has resulted in Annex I. Here, a selection of quick-fixes is suggested, which the EC can discuss with the MA concerned, in order to ensure that future data aggregation is better facilitated. Even though the quick-fixes suggested are minor in character, these are central to a quality and consistent analysis of monitoring data. Other inconsistencies are outlined in more detail in Annex II/III. This annex lists in detail what inconsistencies were observed (and where), and as such can also be used as a checklist for EC in discussions with MA. Recommendation Even though the quality of reporting has improved in comparison with last year, the EC and MA still have a considerable number of data entry inconsistencies to resolve in order to improve the quality of monitoring data in SFC2014. The EC is recommended to use the ",

Consistency in reporting on scope The following consistency checks were conducted, to assess the quality and consistency of reporting. Type of test Condition Compare allocated budget at the level of PAx / type of region in AIR / OP Should be the same The table below reports the number of instances that such inconsistencies were found, and on the budgetary implications of the inconsistencies reported. Various errors of substantial magnitude were found in the AIR2015. However, most inconsistencies have been resolved in AIR 2016. The table below shows that only 4 minor inconsistencies persisted in this years\u2019 reporting round, for 1 PAx in ES and for 3 PAx in FR. In both MS, budgets reported in the AIR allocated at the PAx level are marginally different from those in the OP. These inconsistencies are not related to different versions of OP, but are a structural reporting inconsistency between budgets reported in the AIR and OP.

The inconsistencies reported also affect the values presented in the remainder of this section. Annex II presents in more detail the OP / PAx where these inconsistencies were found, so these can be investigated.

        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 129 to have taken the performance reserve into account, and thus set their financial targets below the total allocated budgets. These instances are not reported as inconsistencies; only PF targets that are set below 90% of the total allocated budgets are flagged as inconsistencies. From the total of 102 cases with low targets, 51 cases are lower than 90% of the total budget, and should be reviewed on their ambition level. However, another 51 low targets are more peculiar 58 , as these are set at 100% of the total allocated EU share of funding . Though MS do not report why they have set their targets at the level of EU funding, as opposed to the total of EU+MS allocated funding, this could point to a misunderstanding. Given that most MS report their targets in comparison total allocated budgets (MS+EU share), it is suggested that these deviating MS align their PF accordingly (BE, BG, FR, HU, IT, MT, NL, RO, SE, UK). Because target achievement and implementation rates are also calculated on the basis of EU+MS shares, the targets in the performance framework should be as well. In addition, there are a small number of exceptional cases of other inconsistencies. In ES (2014ES05M9OP001) and FR (2014FR05SFOP001) for instance, no financial target has been defined for the performance framework. Moreover, in four instances (in GR, IT and twice in FI \u2013 see annex II for details), the milestone target for 2018 defined in the performance framework is higher than the total target in 2023 and needs to be revised. This issue was already reported in the synthesis report of AIR 2015 monitoring data and has not yet been resolved. These errors seem caused by the fact that the number entry for milestone targets (financial and outputs) does not seem require similar validation as the other data entry fields. In this field, MS have entered milestones with an inconsistent use of commas (,) and periods (.) to separate thousands and decimals, thus creating the possibility that a minimal error distorts aggregations at a large scale.

First of all, it is noted that no financial target has been set in ES (2014ES05M9OP001; see also annex II). Because it is the only OP in ES where YEI is implemented, this means effectively that the entire YEI programme in ES currently does not have a milestone and final target defined. ES does not provide an explanation for the lack of a target, but it is observed that a previous version of the OP (1.2, in comparison to the 58 Please note that the similarity in number of cases 51 and 51 is purely coincidental. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 130 currently formally accepted 2.1), did have a YEI target defined; it is unclear why this target has been removed. There are 2 instances in FR and 1 in IT where the targets set are inconsistent with what should be expected. As reported in more detail in annex II, some of the targets in IT are not set in absolute numbers, but as a percentage (in this case 100: 2014IT05M9OP001), which causes problems in aggregation. In FR (2014FR05M0OP001), the milestone 2018 and the final target are not equal, as would be expected for YEI. In BE, FR and UK, there are instances where the PF targets are also unusually low and seem to be set for the EU share only.

In FR, NL and SE there are a number of instances where no intervention field is linked to the budget; as such, these budgets cannot be linked to an Investment Priority. However, it concerns small budgets in NL and SE; only in FR the size of unallocated budget is larger (\u20ac57.4 million), though still small in comparison to the total budget. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 131 The second inconsistency test verifies whether the intervention field provided for each expense is linked to the correct thematic objective. SFC allows MS to select the intervention code for Access to Employment (equivalent to IP8i), and subsequently select Thematic Objective 10. Even though there can be good reasons to do so, when this is the case SFC offers the option of \u2018secondary thematic objectives\u2019. It is assumed that the first thematic objective should be in line with the main objective of that intervention code. Overall 2% of the EU budget (\u20ac892.6 million) has such an inconsistent link, affecting spending reporting in BE, CZ, ES, FI, FR, HR, HU, IT, LT, LV, NL, PL, SE, UK. It is noted that this inconsistency does not affect the analysis in this chapter. Due to substantial inconsistencies, the field of Thematic Objectives was not used for this chapter; all budgets were allocated on the basis of intervention fields directly. The third inconsistency test is the most important one, and as will be shown below, has considerable effects on the results presented in this chapter. It tests whether there are differences in the allocation of PAx budgets to intervention fields in the OP compared to the allocation of actual spending to intervention fields. In principle, it is expected that these should be in line, but for 0.8% of the budget (\u20ac352.5 million), this is not the case. Most problematic in this respect are FI and HR. Based on AIR2015, last year\u2019s synthesis report already outlined the inconsistencies in the reporting of these MS; substantial parts of spending is not only not allocated to the same intervention fields as the OP, but are in fact allocated to non-ESF intervention fields. This leads to confusing reporting where training measures in basic skills of disadvantaged groups in FI are coded as \u2018Development and promotion of tourism assets\u2019. \u20ac 62.1 million (13.6% of the total budgets) has been allocated inconsistently, as will also become clear in the chapter below. In various instances FI reports spending in categories where it supports no projects, while in others it reports projects, participations and results, but no funding. In a small number of other cases in BE, FR, HR, IT, LT, NL, SE, UK similar inconsistencies were spotted, but here these inconsistencies are considerably less problematic. ",
        "Synthesis Report of ESF 2017 Annual Implementation Reports 132 Annex IV - Sources of data The OP data shared by the EC is based on the latest submitted version to the EC (see below).
