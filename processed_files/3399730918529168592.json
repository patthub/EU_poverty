        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1. INTRODUCTION Countries are facing a growing number of disasters that result in huge human and economic losses. Climate change, poverty and unsustainable development, increasing urbanisation and population, and ecosystem and natural resources depletion are only some of the drivers that contribute to increase communities\u2019 vulnerability against disaster. Against this backdrop, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal on the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (2011/0461) to increase EU\u2019s resilience by improving the effectiveness of the systems in place for preventing, preparing for and responding to natural and man-made disasters. In the context of the ongoing legislative report on the European Commission proposal and in order to exchange views with experts and national and international organisations, the European Parliament's Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety requested the organisation of a workshop that took place at the European Parliament in Brussels on Thursday 15 November 2012. The workshop was structured in three sessions. The first and second sessions, both chaired by the Rapporteur of the report MEP Ms Elisabetta Gardini (EPP, IT), included the keynote speech by the Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response Kristalina Georgieva and several presentations on prevention, preparedness and response. The third session, chaired by Shadow rapporteur of the report MEP Ms Edite Estrela (S&D, PT), addressed the technology available in the event of a disaster. PE 492.464 5 ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2. KEYNOTE SPEECH In her opening remarks, Ms Gardini made reference to the recent crisis experienced by the US, in which despite the early warning and the availability of information, the hurricane Sandy stroke hardly. Before introducing the Commissioner, she pointed out that the EU needs to be better prepared and better protected than never before, since the likelihood of future large-scale emergencies will probably increase. 2.1. The Commission proposal on a \"Union Civil Protection Mechanism\" Ms Kristalina Georgieva 1 began her speech by highlighting the role played by the European Parliament in the context of strengthening the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (CPM). As she pointed out, climate change, population and urbanisation growth, as well as industrial development are among the factors that contribute to increasing risks. In fact, 2011 ($400 bn.) broke the previous record on economic losses related to emergencies established six years ago. In this vein, the Commissioner called for building more resilient societies to face the increasing number of disasters. After introducing a few facts of the CPM, Ms Georgieva described a few actions that would contribute to strengthening the CPM and covering a full cycle approach (prevention, preparedness, response and rehabilitation): \uf0b7 Put more emphasis on preparedness and prevention \uf0b7 Increase the predictability in the deployment of modules \uf0b7 Assess the cost-benefit of actions at every level (local, regional and EU) based on the principles of solidarity, subsidiarity and cost-effectiveness. The CPM is the main, but not only building block of civil protection (CP). As she explained, CP is being integrated to certain extent in the Structural and Cohesion Funds and Environmental Impact Assessment, while actions to engage the insurance industry are also being taken. The Commissioner explained then some of the main provisions of the new legislative proposal: \uf0b7 Strong emphasis on risk assessment for better scenario planning \uf0b7 Voluntary pool of assets for EU deployment \uf0b7 EU funding of assets for high-risk low-probability disasters, only after a thorough cost-benefit analysis. \uf0b7 Funding arrangements for transport and training exercises To close her intervention, Ms Georgieva made reference to the current status of the negotiations. 1 Ms Georgieva is the Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response.

        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2.2. Q&A, open discussion 2 MEP Mr Vittorio Prodi was the first to take the floor in the Q&A session and called for fostering the cooperation and joint exercises with military forces, especially to benefit from the logistic assets they already have in place. After Mr Prodi\u2019s intervention, Mr Axel Johan Hagelstam 3 asked whether there was coordination between the EU CP and the civil emergency planning community at NATO. As a response to Mr Prodi\u2019s question, Ms Georgieva cited two examples of joint cooperation with the EU military staff. Despite recognising the importance of the civil-military interface, she pointed out that the main objective of the new legislative proposal was to better use the existing CP capabilities. As for the joint exercises, the Commissioner clarified that so far there have not been carried out, but both communities are in contact through periodic briefings. Ms Georgieva continued by explaining that no direct EU CP \u2013 NATO relations exist due to reasons of legislative nature. In this vein, she stated that indirect relations exist through the EU military staff. Following the Commissioner\u2019s answers, Mr Prodi raised the point of relying on a voluntary pool of assets and wondered whether it would not be better to institutionalise that commitment. In her reply, Ms Georgieva clarified that despite the commitment is voluntary, once an asset is offered, its availability is taken for granted except under force majeure situations. Actually, the reason behind the voluntary nature of the pool is the impossibility for some governments to commit any asset, since in some case the competence of CP relies on regional governments. 2 The Q&A session took place after Mr Das\u2019 presentation, but the questions were addressed to Ms Georgieva, since she had to leave the workshop. 3 Mr Hagelstam is assistant of MEP Mr Nils Torvalds.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 3. PREVENTION, PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 3.1. The key elements of the Commission proposal After a few words on the importance and added value of the joint cooperation in the field of CP, Mr Hans Das 4 briefly introduced the CPM and the main activities carried out within the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC). Mr Das continued by addressing the EU approach to preparedness. In this vein, he cited the existing extensive training programme and the joint exercises as two of the main elements within it. Likewise, he highlighted the success of the modular approach in use, which has allowed the predefinition of different sets of assistance. So far 154 modules are contained in the CPM database. Nonetheless, Mr Das clarified that under the current legislative framework, these modules might or might not be available to be deployed in case of emergency. This is to be changed in the new legislative proposal to increase predictability. Mr Das explained then the process of activation of the CPM and described its evolution in terms of activations since its start-up. In this line, he described the EU interventions after the explosion in Cyprus that jeopardised significantly its electricity generation capacity in 2011 and the Polish floods in 2010. To end his intervention, Mr Das made reference to the main changes included in the new legislative proposal: \uf0b7 In general terms, shift from the current ad-hoc system to a pre-planned system where there is more predictability. \uf0b7 Introduce a mandatory information exchange with MSs on risk assessment to move towards risk-based approaches (Article 6). \uf0b7 Introduction of a voluntary pool of assets (Article 11) to increase predictability, enhance planning at EU and international levels, improve the quality of the assistance and foster a need-based response without interference from politics. \uf0b7 Cost-sharing mechanism to overcome capacity gaps identified on the basis of the assets offered in the voluntary pool (Article 12). 3.2. JRC Early Warning Systems in support to the Civil Protection Mechanism In his introductory remarks, Mr Alessandro Annunziato 5 enumerated the main activities carried out within the Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen \u2013 Joint Research Centre ( IPSC-JRC) to support the CPM: \uf0b7 Development and maintenance of natural disasters\u2019 early warning systems \uf0b7 Support in situation assessment activities \uf0b7 Mapping activities 4 Mr Das is Head of Unit A5 \"Civil Protection Policy, Prevention, Preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction\" in DG- ECHO. For more information, see Annex 2. 5 Mr Annunziato works at the GlobeSec Unit of the IPSC-JRC. For more information see Annex 2. PE 492.464 8 ",
        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Among those systems in the first group, Mr Annuziato began describing the main characteristics of the Global Disasters Alerts and Coordination System (GDACS), which can be accessed online for free. As he stated, its main aim is to identify whether an event is of humanitarian concern by estimating quickly the potential effects of an earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or volcano eruption and alerting the responsible authorities. This is done based on the combination of information from different sources and IPSC\u2019s GIS and Geo layers. Special emphasis was put on tsunamis, since right after an earthquake has occurred, an alert has to be sent indicating whether such an event may or may not occur. For such a case, the JRC has a Tsunami Warning System that predicts its likelihood based on different scenarios. The second tool he described was the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), which predicts the likelihood of floods in a certain place. The EFAS system is fed by information and data coming from various meteorological and hydrological agencies. As he explained the information is sent back to the appropriate agencies in the Member States. The last tool of the first group refers to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which in analogy to the previous system, estimates whether the potential conditions are met for a certain emergency (in this case a forest fire) to occur. As described by Mr Annunziato, the system is based on the information provided by meteorological agencies, which is combined with data on the soil condition. The system also provides annual stats on fires and burnt areas and supports decision-making by giving information on which forest fire should be prioritised in the event of simultaneous fires. To end his intervention, Mr Annuziato made reference to the daily reports and dedicated reports for major disaster produced by the IPSC and to the mapping activities carried out to support the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). 3.3. The European response capacity In his introductory remarks, Mr Koen Rademaekers 6 explained briefly the main basic element of the European response capacity. The core of his presentation referred to a study carried out in 2009 to identify response gaps based on several disaster scenarios. The results were grouped in five types of gaps, namely gaps hindering the degree of availability of existing resources, lack of sufficient quantities of major categories of resources, lack of sufficient quantities of specific equipment or expertise, lack of information on specific categories of equipment or expertise, and limited preparedness of major categories of response resources. In the first category, Mr Rademaekers described the following gaps of the European response capacity: \uf0b7 Funding to cover the transportation and deployment of response resources \uf0b7 Capacity to transport the response resources to the site \uf0b7 Lack of EU capability to mandate the dispatch of response resources \uf0b7 Lack of EU capability to mandate the dispatching of experts \uf0b7 Although improving, still limited MIC capability in the areas of assessment, on-site coordination, support to deployment \uf0b7 Limited availability of aerial fire fighting resources 6 Mr Rademaekers is Managing Director at Triple E Consulting. For more information, see Annex 2. PE 492.464 9 ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Due to the lack of time, Mr Rademaekers skipped the rest of the groups and encouraged the attendees to take a look at the study, which is available at Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection\u2019s (DG-ECHO) web page. Among the main conclusions, Mr Rademaekers highlighted the following suggestions to overcome the gaps identified by the study: \uf0b7 Strengthening co-financing options for covering transportation/deployment costs for assistance \uf0b7 Empowering the Commission to mandate the deployment of registered national resources \uf0b7 Guarantee the availability of specified resources during specified periods \uf0b7 Increasing national capacities in combination with promoting registration of modules/resources \uf0b7 Setting up new preparedness activities offered by the Mechanism to address the identified gaps 3.4. Risk assessment and mapping: the challenge of prevention 3.4.1. The UK experience In his opening remarks, Mr Peter Tallantire 7 briefly introduced the UK\u2019s risk based approach to disaster management. In broad terms, this consists of: \uf0b7 Identification of risks \uf0b7 Assessment of risk by identifying the relative significance of given emergencies \uf0b7 Build resilience through prevention, preparedness and capacity building \uf0b7 Evaluation of resilience Before further explaining the steps, he put emphasis on the importance of the local level in disaster management and described a few characteristics of UK\u2019s disaster response. In terms of risk identification, Mr Tallantire mentioned three time frames they look at, namely short term (up to six months), medium term (out to five years) and long term (out to 20 years plus). As he explained, an assessment of the likelihood, plausibility and potential impact of the identified risks is made in the next step. As an example, Mr Tallantire showed the relation between potential impact and plausibility / likelihood of potential threats and hazard the UK might face in the next five years. The results of such assessment serve to draw planning assumptions, which will then be translated into a capability programme. Mr Tallentire finished his intervention by addressing the previous question on the role of military forces. In this context, he stated that the military staff is not integrated in the capabilities programme as such, but they are considered in the planning and thus serve as a reserve capacity for CP. 7 Mr Tallantire is Deputy Director at the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the UK.

        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 3.4.2. The Italian experience Mr Danilo Bilotta 8 gave the speech on behalf of Mr Luigi D\u2019Angelo 9 who could not attend the workshop due to the recent floods in Italy. Mr Bilotta began the speech by referring to the negotiation process and put special emphasis on the aspects related to risk assessments. As he explained, Member States will have to work autonomously to ameliorate their risk management planning at national and local level. This process is completed by the assessment that each Member State will have to do of its risk management capability. In this vein, Mr Bilotta described the evolution over time of the Italian approach to prevention, not without stressing that prevention from a strictly CP point of view implies early warning, emergency planning, training, CP awareness raising, information to the population and implementation of technical legislation, as well as exercises. Thus, he called for bridging the gap between science and culture, risk-related science and risk culture. Nevertheless, prevention goes beyond than CP and also covers all structural activities that aim at protecting a territory through long-term investments in environmental, infrastructural, urban development policies. As he explained, events are becoming more extreme due to climate change and at the same time, countries are less resilient as a result of excessive anthropisation and urbanisation. In this vein, he highlighted the need of a higher commitment at country level in terms of prevention. To finish his speech, Mr Bilotta stated that they are looking forward to the establishment of a structured and cross-cutting approach to prevention at European level, and to get more information about the proposals for cohesion policy funding for 2014-2020 in relation with prevention. 8 Mr Bilotta works for the Permanent Representation of Italy to the European Union. 9 Mr D\u2019Angelo is Head of International Relations of the Italian Civil Protection Department.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 4. SHARING KNOWLEDGE: A TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE After making a wrap-up of the topics covered by the previous panel, Ms Estrela stressed the relevance of increasing the knowledge on disaster risks and sharing best practices. Likewise, she called for fostering synergies between the CPM and other relevant EU initiatives, such as GMES and the Common Information Sharing Environment in order to further push the development of early warning systems and ensuring a rapid response to disasters. In this vein, she proposed to take into account the effectiveness of detection and early warning systems when assessing the performance of the CPM. 4.1. IT tools for information sharing and early warning In his presentation, Mr Peter Billing 10 addressed the main elements of the MIC. As far as the monitoring function is concerned, Mr Billing described some of the tools used within the MIC: \uf0b7 GDACS \uf0b7 EFAS \uf0b7 EFFIS \uf0b7 Meteoalarm As for the information tools, Mr Billing made reference to: \uf0b7 DG-ECHO\u2019s webpage \uf0b7 ECHO daily flash, DG-ECHO\u2019s daily bulletin \uf0b7 ECHO crisis reports, regular reports on the development of a specific disaster \uf0b7 Daily situation map \uf0b7 MIC\u2019s webpage Last but not least, Mr Billing described the main elements used within the MIC to improve coordination. Among these, he put special emphasis on the Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS), which could be considered the backbone of coordination and communication with Member States. As he explained, CECIS serves as secure web-based alert and notification system for emergency situations and as a database for Member States. Besides CECIS, Mr Billing also referred to the technical support activities carried out within the MIC, concretely in the field of satellite imagery and assessments in field missions. 10 Mr Billing is Deputy Head of the Emergency Response Unit. For more information, see Annex 2. PE 492.464 12 ",
        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 4.2. Relevance of sharing knowledge and data collection In her introductory remarks, Ms Paola Albrito 11 presented some facts and numbers on the human and economic losses associated with disasters since 1992 to justify the need of moving forward in the field of CP. As she stated, a reduction of the vulnerability of communities is paramount to reduce the risk of disasters, which requires a multidimensional approach that addresses socio- economic and physical drivers, as well as environmental degradation. These elements were brought together in the so-called Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), which defines the roles of governments, regional organisations and international institutions. In this vein, she pointed out that the Commission\u2019s legislative proposal was in line with the framework adopted in Hyogo. This framework consists of five main points: \uf0b7 Make disaster risk reduction a priority \uf0b7 Know the risks and take action \uf0b7 Build understanding and awareness \uf0b7 Reduce risk \uf0b7 Be prepared and ready to act Ms Albrito showed then a few slides describing the global progress towards the HFA and the increase of economic losses in Europe and OECD countries. Likewise, she made reference to the report \u201cThe Hyogo Framework for Action in Europe\u201d, which provides an overview of the implementation of the HFA in Europe. In this context, three main trends arise: \uf0b7 Countries with national platforms perform better on mainstreaming disaster risk reduction approaches. \uf0b7 There is an evolution from a of crisis and response approach to one of proactive risk reduction. \uf0b7 The gaps identified by national information reports have been taken into account by the regional organisations and the Commission. In her closing remarks, Ms Albrito stressed the need of standardise the way in which economic damages are accounted for and the importance of sharing knowledge and information with regard to investments in disaster risk reduction. 11 Ms Albrito is the Head of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) Regional Office for Europe.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 4.3. Provide communication in post disaster scenario After introducing the European Satellite Operators\u2019 Association (ESOA), Mr Chris McLaughlin 12 enumerated the strengths of satellites and quoted a few sentences from the 8 th Space Council deliverables and the Ms Gardini\u2019s report on the Commission\u2019s legislative proposal, where the importance of telecommunication capacity is recognised. In this vein, Mr McLaughlin stated that satellites serve as a bridge until land-based communication infrastructure is restored after a disaster, not without clarifying first that they also provide relevant services in the other stages of a disaster. Among the concrete services provided by satellites in post-disaster scenarios, Mr McLaughlin cited the following ones: \uf0b7 Logistics support for relief agencies \uf0b7 Telephony, e-mail, Internet access, videoconferencing, instant messaging \uf0b7 Telemedicine to connect to world-class trauma specialist \uf0b7 Tele-education to bring normality to displaced children or destroyed schools \uf0b7 Global awareness of the disaster \uf0b7 Support business continuity In his final remarks, Mr McLaughlin enumerated a few examples in which satellites provided relevant communication services and highlighted the potential role they can play in the CPM. 4.4. Q&A, open discussion Mr Ralf Ackermann 13 asked whether the module deployment was only foreseen inside the EU or whether the modules would also be available for international events. He put special emphasis on the lost of cost-effectiveness when transporting certain modules over long- distances. Ms Estrela asked then whether droughts were also part of the IPSC-JRC work. Mr Das answered the first questions by clarifying that the legislative proposal addresses both the EU and international levels. Nevertheless, he clarified that modules should be deployed from as close as possible. In fact, the voluntary pool will allow ensuring that assets are deployed from the most convenient location. Mr Annunziato answered the second question by stating that despite droughts are part of the JRC work, this are not considered important from the point of view of early warning systems. Ms Gardini closed the workshop thanking the speakers and translators. 12 Mr McLaughlin is Vice President of External Affairs at Inmarsat Plc, which is part of ESOA.

        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Speaking Points by Mr Luigi D\u2019Angelo Risk Assessment and Mapping: The Challenge of Prevention, The Italian Experience \uf0b7 In June 2011 when we met here to discuss the way forward in the field of civil protection cooperation at EU level \u2013 the Commission legislative proposal had been issued only few months ahead - we formulated some recommendations: among these we recalled that the prevention policy at EU level needs to be strengthened through a solid legal basis. Today \u2013 one and a half year later - we can say that the legislative proposal, as amended in the Council, has a new clear and satisfactory shape, at least in this specific sector. \uf0b7 After a not easy negotiation, we managed to find a good compromise based on the sharing of information on risk assessment, self-responsibility of the Member States in developing risk management planning and self-assessment of risk management capability, as well as voluntary participation in peer reviews on the assessment of risk management capability. \uf0b7 We, as Italy, strongly advocated for this compromise text. It\u2019s a text that falls within the limits of the Lisbon Treaty, and confirms that the main responsibility in this field falls within the national competences. At the same time, however, the work done at UE level can support and supplement the action of the Member States. The EU can be a true confidence builder for the Member States that need to advance in this field, and also a collector of information for the Member States who needs to develop a consolidated domestic prevention policy. \uf0b7 Let me also recall that, in the field of risk assessment, we have agreed already in 2009 to advance together towards the development of common methodologies for the identification of major risks and low probability/high impact risks in Europe. Accordingly, guidelines have been elaborated on this topic. So far the Commission has asked the Member States to share their national risk assessments on the most relevant risks. We did it by focusing on our main natural risks (hydro-geological/hydraulic, seismic and volcanic) and we hope to give our contribution for what still needs to be done. \uf0b7 Since those guidelines were issued the cooperation at EU level has continued to advance but a slower pace than we expected. By inserting now a legal obligation in the new legislative proposal we are finally giving momentum to our action in the field of risk assessment. \uf0b7 But the new structure of the proposal goes further than this for what it concerns risk management. The first step, risk assessment, as I mentioned, is something we have worked on for quite a long time already and major -or significant- risks identification will be the natural result of this activity. According to this risk identification the Member States will have to work autonomously to ameliorate their risk management planning at national and local level. This means that also European funding coming from Cohesion policy, for example, could be mainstreamed into the national efforts to build better and more consolidated prevention and preparedness policies. This picture is completed by the assessment that each Member State will have to do, autonomously once again, of its risk management capability. This is, in our opinion, a real added value in the compromise. In our opinion this is the integrated approach we should all aim to, linking risk management with planning elements of emergency response in order to make this very response the best possible one. This is the integrated approach we have to look for at European level. PE 492.464 75 ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ \uf0b7 In Italy this is what we have been working on since a long time. Of course, it is a never ending process, since the risks change - and in the last few years every Autumn in Italy we have a tangible proof that climate change is changing the nature and intensity of disasters as well as its impact on our fragile territory - as well as the availability of resources change. \uf0b7 Italy has been considering prevention as a key aspect of its civil protection national policy. We started with a civil protection system focused only on the response of the Army to cope with earthquakes or other disasters. Then a Department dedicated to civil protection was set up in 1982 within the Prime Minister Office. Nowadays this Department encompasses all capacities related to risk prevention and the same capacities also belong to the civil protection systems at the lower administrative levels. \uf0b7 But, of course, prevention is not something you do overnight. The integrated approach we have built throughout the years in cooperation with the Regions is certainly a key element for ensuring an effective prevention and preparedness activity, as well as a rapid and efficient response built on such an integrated and scientific supported activity. Prevention, from a strictly civil protection point of you implies early warning, emergency planning, training, civil protection awareness raising, information to the population and implementation of technical legislation, as well as exercises (these are what we call non structural prevention activities). In this framework self-protection and awareness raising becomes more an more important, risk assessment must be shared with the citizens. Citizens' awareness must be raised and we think this is one of the biggest challenges for the next future. In a nutshell, we need to bridge the gap between science and culture, risk-related science and risk culture. \uf0b7 However prevention - in its large sense- is not only and exclusively a strictly civil protection competence. Effective prevention in a fragile territory means all structural activities that aim at protecting the territory through long term investments in environmental, infrastructural, urban development policies. \uf0b7 Indeed - if, on the one hand, we have events that (not only outside the EU, but also inside the EU) become more and more extreme, due to climate change. [I give you a direct example, the floods we are currently having in Italy are due to 400 ml of rainfall within 48hrs in one specific area, where we have an average of 1000 ml of rainfall in one year over the national territory]. \uf0b7 On the other hand we have a territory that is less and less resilient to this type of events due to excessive anthropisation and urbanisation. The Italian High Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) has estimated that to secure the entire Italian territory an investment of about 40 billion euros within 15 years would be needed. It is an incredible amount of resources that can only be mobilised if this becomes a priority for the whole Country throughout all levels of government. \uf0b7 We are then also looking forward to the establishment of a structured and cross-cutting approach to prevention at European level, we are interested to understand more about the proposals for Cohesion policy funding for 2014-2020, since disaster prevention and climate adaptation measures are really a key investing priority for the future. We think that this is an excellent development in the way towards making prevention a key point in both European and national disaster risk reduction strategies. PE 492.464 76 ",
        "The Union Civil Protection Mechanism ____________________________________________________________________________________________ \uf0b7 Merging science, institutional commitment, political will and social needs into a unique and consistent strategy is not an easy task for any Country - also taking in due consideration the current economic trends -. A long way is therefore still to come but much has been done already at national and European level and Italy is available to put at disposal of the EU and other Member States its experience and share its good practices and lessons learned within the Union with all those who might be interested in it. \uf0b7 Let me eventually thank the EU Parliament and Mrs Gardini in organizing this event and say that the ongoing activities by the European Parliament are a critical contribution to the development of common policies in this field and a concrete example of how to bridge the gap between policy options in this field and the request of more security and protection coming from European citizens.
