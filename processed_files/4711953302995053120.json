        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY On 22 January 2014, the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) of the European Parliament held a workshop on \u2018Discrimination in Healthcare\u2019. The workshop was hosted by Ms Glenis WILLMOTT (MEP) Mr Alojz PETERLE (MEP), Co-chairs of the Health Working Group within the ENVI Committee. The workshop was structured in two parts. The first part was dedicated to the manifestation of discrimination in the sector of health, whereas the second one focused on the measures taken to improve the situation of discriminated groups. In her opening statement, Ms WILLMOTT highlighted that, despite being a basic right, access to healthcare is hindered by various factors in the European Union. Vulnerable groups, such as LGBT people, the Roma, migrants and people living with mental health problems are at a greater risk of discrimination. The speakers at the workshop described the scale of the problem and the measures that the different Member States have put in place to address the issue. Mr PETERLE noted that, in addition to discrimination, patients often experience unequal situations in the sector of health. To address the problem, policy documents such as the European Health Strategy play an important role. The Strategy contains important principles, such as \u2018health for all\u2019 and \u2018health in all policies\u2019, which should be implemented. Prof. Graham THORNICROFT, Head of Health Service Research Department at the Institute of Psychiatry, Professor of Community Psychiatry King\u2019s College of London, described the vulnerable situation of people with mental health problems. Vulnerability is mainly linked to the so-called \u2018treatment gap\u2019 which refers to the phenomenon that most people in the world who have mental illnesses receive no treatment. As a second issue, Prof. THORNICROFT referred to the reduced life expectancy of people with mental health problems. Higher rates of unnatural deaths, e.g. suicide and accident, and poorer healthcare, e.g. lack of treatment, contribute to premature mortality. Health inequalities and discrimination can be addressed both at local level, e.g. by increasing social interaction between health professionals and their patients, and at national level, e.g. by awareness-raising campaigns. Prof. THORNICROFT in his concluding remarks referred to the necessity of implementing existing legal and policy measures, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The presentation of the second speaker, Mr Anthony BABAJEE \u2013 a young LGBT activist, focused on the types of discrimination and health inequalities that gay men with HIV living in London face, including cases where HIV positive people disappear from the list of patients, or when general practitioners are reluctant to give them advice or refer them to the right specialists. Mr BABAJEE said that knowledge-sharing and awareness-raising play a key role in improving the situation of LGBT people in the UK. Sources similar to the FS magazine and campaigns, such as the \u2018It starts with me\u2019 campaign, play a key role in ensuring greater awareness. Mr BABAJEE welcomed legislative changes similar to the one which was adopted in 2013, i.e. the Health and Social Care Act 2012, as a result of which, the competence of commissioning HIV testing and prevention services has been transferred to the local authorities. In his view, local communities can commission more effective campaigns and testing work. Marian MANDACHE, Executive Director of Romani CRISS, described the challenges that ethnic minorities, such as the Roma, face in the healthcare sector. It was explained that due to poor living conditions and the lack of financial means to eat healthy food, Roma people often have poor health conditions and, thus, are more dependent on health services. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 6 Despite their needs, Roma people often receive poor healthcare services, as health professionals lack awareness of their culture and living conditions, and the Roma also often lack social insurance or health insurance. Mr MANDACHE referred to the most urgent forms of discrimination against the Roma, which are the forced sterilisation of Roma women, the segregation of Roma women and children in hospitals, the discrimination of Roma patients by medical staff, and the \u2018state-sponsored\u2019 discrimination of the Roma, e.g. placing the Roma into polluted neighbourhoods. To address these issues Mr MANDACHE highlighted: the importance of training health professionals on diversity and anti-discrimination; the necessity of taking legal steps against those who commit discrimination; and the need to invest more in projects that could have positive impacts on the Roma community. The second part of the workshop started with the presentation of Mr Ioannis N. DIMITRAKOPOULOS, Head of Department of the Equality and Citizens' Rights, Fundamental Rights Agency of the European Union, who mainly described the applicable legislative framework and its shortcomings. Legal protection against discrimination is provided by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the Equality Directives, i.e. Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC and Employment Equality Directive 2000/78/EC. Legislation currently in force does not provide protection to all groups who could be discriminated against, fails to extend to all sectors, and does not provide protection against discrimination on multiple grounds. According to Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS, if adopted, the Horizontal Directive on Discrimination might resolve the existing problems. The last speaker, Dr Gianfranco COSTANZO, Head of Unit for International Relations, of the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty Institute (Italy), provided a practical insight into the way the Institute tackles discrimination on a daily basis. The Institute provides cost-effective solutions to vulnerable groups, such as migrants and poor people. Dr COSTANZO said that costs linked to specialised services are lower than those linked to emergency treatments, thus providing access to specialised outpatient services was considered as a cost-effective measure. Dr COSTANZO concluded that measures should not only be cost-effective, but accessible. Regarding accessibility, he referred to physical access, e.g. suitable opening hours; relational access, e.g. health professionals speaking foreign languages; and economic access, e.g. affordable services. In their concluding remarks, Ms WILLMOTT and Mr PETERLE emphasised the importance of the topic and called on the European Institutions to take action. Mr PETERLE highlighted the importance of workshops in helping people to become better informed; whereas Ms WILLMOTT mentioned the significance of projects that target all discriminated groups and all forms of discrimination.

        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 7 1. LEGAL AND POLICY BACKGROUND The right to health is recognised as a fundamental right in many international and European human rights instruments and in national laws. At the EU level, Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 1 recognises the right to non- discrimination on any ground, including race, ethnic or social origin, age or sexual orientation. Article 35 guarantees the right of access to preventive healthcare and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices. Protection against discrimination is reinforced by the so-called \u2018Equality Directives\u2019, i.e. the Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC 2 and Employment Equality Directive 2000/78/EC 3 . The Racial Equality Directive provides protection from discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin in various sectors, including the sector of health; whereas the Employment Equality Directive provides protection in the sector of employment to groups characterised by religion or belief, sexual orientation, disability and age. The legal protection provided by these Directives does not extend to all groups and to all sectors. Moreover, a recent FRA opinion 4 , assessing the implementation of the existing Directives shows that discrimination and health inequalities still exist across the EU. The lack of reliable and comparable EU level health statistics makes it difficult to obtain a full picture of all discriminated groups in the sector of health. The lack of data can be explained by the fact that the Member States are not obliged to collect data systematically in the sector of health. Existing data, targeting one discriminated group, e.g. LGBT people or the Roma, well-illustrates the scale and nature of the problem. For example, a recent FRA survey 5 revealed that twice as many Roma women aged 50 and above, declared their health conditions as \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019 compared to non-Roma women of the same age group. Another survey 6 found that one in 10 of the respondents who had accessed healthcare services, in the year preceding the survey, reported discriminatory practices. The collection of reliable statistics, including disaggregated data, would help to create better-targeted policy and legal measures 7 . 1 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C 364/01) is available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf. 2 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22\u201326, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:180:0022:0026:EN:PDF. 3 Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16\u201322, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:303:0016:0022:EN:PDF. 4 FRA Opinion on the situation of equality in the European Union 10 years on from initial implementation of the equality directives, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/opinion/2013/fra-opinion-situation-equality-european- union-10-years-initial-implementation-equality. 5 FRA, \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ep- request-roma-women.pdf. 6 FRA, \u2018European LGBT survey- European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey\u2019- Results at a glance, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/eu-lgbt-survey-results-at-a-glance_en.pdf. 7 Source: http://fra.europa.eu/en/speech/2013/improving-access-and-combating-discrimination-healthcare- focus-vulnerable-groups-fra.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 8 Health inequalities 8 and discrimination in the sector of health have significant economic implications for the EU and its Member States. A recent European Parliament resolution suggests that \u2018losses linked to health inequalities have been estimated to cost around 1,4% of the total GDP 9 . The European Commission document \u2018Investing in health\u2019 10 , accompanying the Commission Communication \u2018Towards Social Investment for Growth and Cohesion\u2019 11 shows how investment in reducing health inequalities contributes to the achievement of the Europe 2020 objective of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The proposed Health for Growth Programme 12 , continuing to promote the principles and objectives of the EU\u2019s 2008-2013 \u2018Together for Health\u2019 Strategy, i.e. \u2018health for all\u2019 and \u2018health in all policies\u2019 13 , also acknowledges the importance of reducing health inequalities in order to achieve inclusive growth. In terms of legislative developments, the Horizontal Directive 14 , if adopted, might address issues linked to health discrimination, by extending legal protection to discrimination in healthcare on all grounds, including disability, age and sexual orientation. The European Commission\u2019s proposal for the new Directive has been blocked in the Council since 2008. The obligation for the EU to strengthen protection against discrimination will be reinforced once the EU accesses the European Convention on Human Rights. EU accession to the European Convention is required by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on the European Union 15 . The European Convention on Human Rights provides that the enjoyment of rights must be secured without discrimination on any grounds 16 . Moreover the European Social Charter 17 , complementing the European Convention on Human Rights, guarantees the right to health. Protection against discrimination, including discrimination in the sector of health, is also enshrined in international conventions, e.g. the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 18 which the EU ratified in 2010. The ratification of this Convention entails that EU institutions and the Member States must consider and comply with the provisions of the Convention whilst developing and implementing laws and policies. 8 The term \u2018health inequalities\u2019 means differences in health status between individuals or groups, as measured by for example life expectancy, mortality or disease.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP 2.1 Introduction 2.1.1 Welcome and opening \u2013 Glenis WILLMOTT (MEP) and Alojz PETERLE (MEP) In her opening remarks Ms Willmott emphasised that despite being a basic right, access to healthcare is hindered by various factors in the EU, one of which is discrimination. Discrimination has many forms and may target many groups of people, including LGBT, Roma, migrants and people living with mental health problems. Ms Willmott commented that the speakers in this workshop represented many of the most vulnerable groups. To illustrate the scale of the problem, Ms Willmott referred to a recent report of the European Union\u2019s Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) 19 , which found that, in the EU, an average of 42% of LGBT patients are not open with their healthcare professionals about their sexual orientation or gender identity, and 10% of the total of LGBT patients feel that they have been discriminated against by healthcare personnel in the past 12 months. Regarding discrimination against minority groups, a FRA report stated that, in the Czech Republic, 18% of the Roma population have experienced discrimination in healthcare 20 . Ms Willmott also referred to a recent UK report 21 , which found that 51% of older people feel that healthcare providers dismiss symptoms and treat them as those linked to old age, instead of looking for the real cause behind their diseases. Before handing over to Mr Peterle, Ms Willmott called on the speakers of this workshop to describe the scale of the problem in a more detailed manner and she expressed her hopes for an interesting discussion. Mr Peterle approached the topic from the citizens\u2019 perspective by saying that \u2018no one likes discrimination\u2019. Regarding the definition of discrimination, he clarified that not all differentiated treatment is actually discrimination. Nevertheless, even those cases are unpleasant when one experiences differentiated treatment. To illustrate this, he referred to the higher life expectancy of those citizens who live in countries with stronger healthcare systems, as opposed to those who are from countries with less developed healthcare systems. He also said that information on specialised care, such as cancer treatment, is not always shared across the Member States. The European Union plays a key role in addressing these issues. One of the steps taken to tackle the problem, is the adoption of the European Health Strategy, in which the EU has put forward two very important principles, which are \u2018Health for All\u2019 and \u2018Health in all Policies\u2019. Discrimination can be eliminated through the implementation of these principles. Mr Peterle finished by welcoming the speakers who represented many groups that are discriminated against in the EU. He emphasised, however, that there are many other groups, such as cancer patients, who also experience discrimination in the sector of health. 19 FRA \u2018EU LGBT survey- European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey- Results at a glance\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/eu-lgbt-survey-results-at-a-glance_en.pdf. 20 FRA \u2018Inequalities and multiple discrimination in access to and quality of healthcare\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inequalities-discrimination-healthcare_en.pdf. 21 Department of Health \u2018Ageism and age discrimination in secondary healthcare in the United Kingdom\u2019, available at: http://www.cpa.org.uk/information/reviews/CPA-ageism_and_age_discrimination_in_secondary_health_care- report.pdf.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 10 2.2 How does discrimination affect people? Who is affected? 2.2.1 Evidence to decrease mental health related stigma and discrimination Prof. Graham THORNICROFT, Head of Health Service Research Department at the Institute of Psychiatry, Professor of Community Psychiatry King\u2019s College of London (UK) Prof. Thornicroft\u2019s presentation was structured around three main ideas, notably the concept of a mental health gap, the link between mental diseases and premature mortality, and the overview of existing policy actions and practices. Prior to describing the meaning of \u2018mental health gap\u2019, Prof. Thornicroft illustrated the scale of the problem of mental health related stigma and discrimination by saying that each year about a quarter of the total world population develops a mental disease. Across the globe, about 600 million people live with mental illnesses and, every year, about 900 thousand people kill themselves, i.e. around 3,000 people committing suicide each day. Prof. Thornicroft said that, in Europe, only 25% of people with mental illnesses receive medical treatment, whereas the other 75% remain without treatment. Prof. Thornicroft defined this situation as a \u2018mental health gap\u2019 22 . He continued by discussing the World\u2019s Mental Health Survey 23 , which compared the treatment of patients with mental and physical disorders in both low and high-income countries. The data suggested that more than 50% of patients with physical disorders are receiving treatment even in the poorest countries, compared to only 10% of patients with mental disorders receiving treatment. These numbers illustrate the scale of the stigmatisation and discrimination that people with mental illnesses face in both low and high income countries. According to Prof. Thornicroft an important manifestation of stigmatisation and discrimination is the premature mortality of people with mental disorders. Despite counter opinion of certain policy makers, mental diseases actually kill people each year. To prove this, Prof. Thornicroft quoted from a recent research paper 24 analysing the life-expectancy of patients with mental disorders in three Scandinavian countries. The research showed that in Finland, Denmark and Sweden, 15-year old women with mental illnesses are expected to live 15 years less on average than those without such diseases. For men from the same age group, the life-expectancy difference was 20 years. He also emphasised that disparities between the life-expectancy of healthy and mentally ill people are not narrowing over time; and interestingly, there are many articles with almost identical conclusions to the Scandinavian research paper that are published across the globe, including in Australia 25 . To conclude this part of the presentation Prof. Thornicroft said that, in his view, lack of treatment was responsible for the premature death of many mentally ill patients and that this was the \u2018worst form of lethal discrimination\u2019. 22 Robert Kohn, Shekhar Saxena, Itzhak Levav, & Benedetto Saraceno \u2018The treatment gap in mental health care\u2019, available at: http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/11/en/858.pdf; Wang, P.

        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 11 Before describing the possible actions that could be taken to address mental health discrimination, Prof. Thornicroft referred to one of his recent books 26 dedicated to the discrimination of people with mental illness. He said that his original intention was to write only about stigmatisation, but whilst discovering the scale of the problem he realised that stigmatisation and discrimination were interlinked. Prof. Thornicroft said that stigmatisation results from three different elements, namely lack of knowledge, misinformation and ignorance; emotional motives, such as fear, prejudice and anxiety, towards people with mental illnesses; and behavioural aspects, which he referred to as discrimination. Discrimination in the sector of healthcare can be addressed at both local and national levels. At the local level, there is room for applying the so-called \u2018social contact theory\u2019. According to the theory that dates back to 1924, direct and personal social contact with individuals of stigmatised groups is effective in reducing stigma. To test the theory, many intervention studies have been conducted, showing that active contact between health professionals and patients, increases knowledge, improves attitudes and behaviours, and reduces stigma. Other means of effective social contact include filming interviews with mental health patients, or live consumer talks. At national level, effective means of interventions include programmes similar to \u2018Time to Change\u2019 27 , which aims to improve public attitudes towards people with mental health problems through, for example, campaigns. The evaluation of the first four years progress led by Prof. Thornicroft, shows that discrimination has dropped by about 11% over time. \u2018Time to Change\u2019 has recently formed the so-called Global Alliance of Stigma, comprising mainly of countries with national level intervention programmes. The Alliance is a platform for knowledge sharing, and for the exchange of good practices. The support of prominent celebrities is also a helpful measure, as celebrities can motivate people to fight against stigmatisation and discrimination. For example, Glenn Close addresses major conferences about confronting stigma in mental health. Amongst the policy and legal measures, Prof. Thornicroft referred to the necessity of implementing the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Prof. Thornicroft said that this Convention, which has been ratified by most of the countries across the globe, is a powerful tool to fight against the discrimination of people with any type of disability. Finally, Prof. Thornicroft mentioned the so-called \u2018ITHACA toolkit\u2019 28 which could be used to monitor respect for human rights and general healthcare in psychiatric and social care institutions. 25 BMJ 2013;346:f2539 \u2018The gap in life expectancy from preventable physical illness in psychiatric patients in Western Australia: retrospective analysis of population based registers\u2019, available at: http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f2539. 26 Prof. Thornicroft \u2018Shunned: Discrimination against People with Mental Illness\u2019, available at: http://www.globalmentalhealth.org/resources/shunned-graham-thornicroft. 27 \u2018Time to Change\u2019 is England's biggest programme to challenge mental health stigma and discrimination.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 12 2.2.2 Discrimination in healthcare based on sexual orientation Mr Anthony BABAJEE, LGBT activist Mr Babajee started his presentation by describing the \u2018It starts with me\u2019 campaign 29 , which is a national campaign in England of the Terrence Higgins Trust 30 . The campaign aims to stop the spread of HIV by communicating messages about the importance of protection by means of HIV testing, the use of condoms and HIV treatment as prevention 31 (TasP). As part of the campaign National HIV Testing Week takes place in the last week of November each year \u2013 the week before World Aids Day. Mr Babajee, while referring to the importance of testing, stated that gay men and people with African origins are disproportionally affected by HIV in the UK. His presentation mainly focused on the types of discrimination and health inequalities that gay men with HIV living in London face, but he stated that these examples can be used by analogy to the sorts of discrimination and inequalities that other groups within the broader LGBT community face. Mr Babajee said that knowledge-sharing and awareness-raising play a key role in improving the situation of LGBT people in the UK. Sources, similar to FS magazine 32 , provide particularly valuable information to gay people. Mr Babajee was recently featured in an article in FS magazine about gay community role models, where he tells his own story of living openly with HIV and campaigning for better awareness. He emphasised that articles published in the FS magazine are non-judgmental, thus they meet gay men where they are in their lives rather than telling them where they should be. The stories are also relevant and real, and manage to talk about sex and sexual heath in appropriate and everyday language. Another positive element he mentioned was that the magazine tackles hot topics, such as unprotected sex, or sexualised drug-taking and sexual racism, that health professionals are often reluctant to talk about or do not know how to address effectively. Moreover, stories in the magazine are thought-provoking and informative, thus encourage gay men to consider their own actions. Mr Babajee then continued by giving an overview of the situation of HIV-positive people in the UK. In 2012, about 98,400 people were living with HIV in the UK, of these about 22% were unaware of their HIV infection. Considering this, it is of particular importance to get HIV testing rates up. Regarding this point, Mr Babajee talked about a recent legislative change in England (the Health and Social Care Act 2012 33 ), as a result of which since April 2013 the competence of commissioning HIV testing and prevention services, has been transferred to local authorities. Prior to this change, testing was commissioned by National Health Service (NHS) according to the needs of each local area with particular regard to HIV prevalence rates. The challenge after this shift of control over commissioning is to make sure that the local authorities do commission the most effective campaign and testing work. 29 More information on the \u2019It starts with me\u2019 campaign, is available at: https://www.tht.org.uk/itstartswithme. 30 Terrence Higgins Trust is an NGO which aims at maximising sexual health in the UK and minimising the spread of HIV.

",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 13 This is a challenge, as many local councillors have only limited understanding of the scale of the problem, and HIV and sexual health can often be nearer to the bottom of a politician\u2019s list of political priorities. Civic organisations, such as the Terrence Higgins Trust, play a key role in sharing the knowledge with the local authorities. As an example of the actions at the local level, Mr Babajee referred to the \u2018HIV needs assessment\u2019 commissioned by London Councils 34 in 2013. The needs assessment found that there is a need for more targeted work, aiming at the most affected communities, such as gay and black African men. To increase effectiveness, it was decided to involve members of such communities in the work. Moreover, the assessment found that target groups find the currently available information irrelevant and often too medicalised, thus there is a need for the use of more effective and rather conversational language. Mr Babajee found it regrettable that FS magazine had not been commissioned by London Councils. To conclude, Mr Babajee provided some examples about the types of discrimination that he has experienced while accessing health services. First he referred to a case, when he, after disclosing his HIV-positive status to a dentist, suddenly and inexplicably disappeared from the list of patients 35 . In another anecdote, Mr Babajee illustrated the ignorance that many gay men face when accessing primary healthcare services. He developed depression around the time when he was diagnosed with HIV. His general practitioner could not provide any sort of advice to him and was seemingly unable to make a referral for him to competent specialists. Through this example Mr Babajee also aimed to illustrate that health professionals often forget about the fact that LGBT people are, first and foremost, people. To tackle these issues there is a need for improved communication between healthcare professionals and minority groups, such as LGBT people. Communication with LGBT people will help them understand the needs of this community and allow them to better support them. Another area in which healthcare professionals can improve their skills is the use of and understanding of new technologies, such as smartphone applications. LGBT people use these applications extensively, especially gay men, in their everyday life, e.g. to find information and to meet each other. To wrap up Mr Babajee emphasised the need for right, non-judgemental services tailored to the type of people they are caring for. 2.2.3 Racial and ethnic factors as determinants of healthcare Mr Marian MANDACHE, Executive Director Romani CRISS Mr Mandache opened his presentation with a brief description of the Roma community and the main issues that they face. The Roma are an ethnic group originating from India. They are widely dispersed, with the majority living in Europe. Over the centuries, The Roma have repeatedly been subject to persecution, in particular during the five centuries of the Romanian Principalities 36 , and the Holocaust during the Second World War. Nowadays, the Roma are often socially marginalised and face challenges whilst exercising their rights, including the right to free movement. Mr Mandache remarked that in Europe, the Roma community is the most impoverished and discriminated against. 34 London Councils is an umbrella organisation working for each of the London borough councils. More information on the London Councils is available at: http://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/aboutus/default.htm. 35 Discrimination by dentists based on HIV status is illegal in the UK. More information is available at: http://www.tht.org.uk/myhiv/HIV-and-you/Your-healthcare/Dental-care. 36 Roma people were subject to slavery during the period of the Romanian Principalities. This era started in the 13th and 14th century, until it was abolished in the 19th century. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 14 Amongst the main health challenges that the Roma face, Mr Mandache referred to their poor health conditions developed as a result of their living conditions \u2013 often in polluted environments. The public authorities often place Roma communities close to garbage pits or waste treatment plants, which according to Mr Mandache, constitutes environmental discrimination. Other health issues are linked to malnutrition in Roma communities where they often lack the financial means to eat healthy food and to maintain a minimum level of hygiene. Mr Mandache also referred to the lack of awareness by the health professionals of Roma culture and living conditions. He went on to explain the causes and consequences of the Roma not being able to have social insurance. The Roma often do not have papers, such as IDs or birth certificates, therefore making it impossible to obtain social insurance for themselves and their families. In Romania, social insurance is granted to those with legal work contracts or those who are granted social welfare. However, due to the current financial crisis, the Government aims to cut costs which might change the criteria used to grant social insurance and health coverage. These changes are likely to affect Roma communities, but to overcome this issue Romania might introduce basic insurance packages specifically for the Roma. These are likely to cover only some life-saving treatments and the treatment of epidemic diseases. Mr Mandache emphasised that health services often have cost implications which the Roma people cannot cover. These costs can be both direct, e.g. medical insurance and medication, and/or indirect, e.g. transportation costs. Mr Mandache continued by referring to the major forms of discrimination that the Roma face. The most urgent forms include the forced sterilisation of Roma women, the segregation of Roma women and children in hospitals, the discrimination of Roma patients by medical staff, and the \u2018state-sponsored\u2019 discrimination of the Roma. Mr Mandache provided examples of these types of discrimination. Regarding the sterilisation of Roma women, he referred to the practices followed in Czechoslovakia between 1971 and 1991, which were conducted to reduce the size of the Roma population. Sterilisations were often carried out without the consent of Roma women during Caesarean sections or abortions. Mr Mandache stated that the segregation of Roma patients in hospitals is common practice in many Central and Eastern European countries, e.g. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. In 2011 Romani CRISS, together with ECPI reported a case of segregation in the Marie Curie Hospital in Bucharest 37 where Romani patients were being placed in rooms different to those for other citizens. The report followed a prosecution and the case is currently pending before a court. Regarding the discrimination of the Roma by health professionals, Mr Mandache referred to various discriminatory practices, including the examination of Roma patients after the examination of all non-Roma patients, the use of derogatory language, the redirection of Roma patients to health providers that were located far from their homes, and the failure to provide health information about the health risks associated with certain conditions or health interventions. 37 More information on the case is available at: http://www.romanicriss.org/PDF/Press%20release%20children%20segregation%20in%20hospital%20Marie%20C urie%20dec%202011.pdf. ",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 15 As a wider issue of concern, Mr Mandache described the concept of \u2018systematic state- sponsored racism\u2019. He suggested that many European Governments, e.g. the French Government, put in place racist measures by which they undermine the living conditions of the Roma. As an example, he referred to measures ordering the destruction of their homes. He also suggested that in some countries, such as in Romania, the Governments turn a blind eye to the racist actions of local authorities against the Roma \u2013 which is equally destructive. Mr Mandache continued by stating that even the Fundamental Agency of the European Union has found the situation of the Roma \u2018shocking\u2019. A recent FRA survey found that over 20% of Roma people are not covered by health insurance and that 90% of them live below the national poverty lines 38 . Against this context, Mr Mandache suggested some actions. He emphasised the importance of training health professionals on diversity and anti-discrimination. There is a need to train health professionals in a similar manner to the health mediators 39 who have been operating in Romania since 2002. He commented that priorities need to be reconsidered whilst distributing resources since there is less need to invest in research and more need to take real actions with direct positive impact on the Roma communities. Mr Mandache emphasised the possibility of legal remedies, e.g. litigating on the ground that discrimination has occurred, and called on the European Commission to start infringement actions against certain Member States, and to provide funding for litigation on the ground of discrimination. As a final remark, Mr Mandache referred to the necessity of exploring the possibility of suspending EU funding to those Member States that breach fundamental rights by engaging in systematic discrimination, or fail to implement national Roma strategies. 2.2.4 First round of questions and answers This section started with the observations of Michael CASHMAN, a Member of the European Parliament and Co-Founder of Stonewall 40 , who opened with the statement that the common elements of the situations that the speakers have already talked about are ignorance and prejudice. To illustrate the situation of the LGBT community in Europe, he quoted the singer Madonna, who once said that coming out as an LGBT is a heroic thing to do, and those who declare themselves as HIV positive are warriors. Mr CASHMAN clarified that it takes courage to declare either of them, and that both groups face stigmatisation and discrimination. Regarding the other groups, he referred to the difficult situation of the Roma and mentally ill people, who also face prejudice and ignorance in their everyday lives. 38 FRA \u2018The situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States - Survey results at a glance\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2012/situation-roma-11-eu-member-states-survey-results-glance. 39 Health mediators are professionals who support Roma people in their access to healthcare services with the aim of improving the health status of Roma.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 16 According to Mr CASHMAN, these people should be supported in the form of education and training, since this is the only way to empower them with the necessary knowledge of their rights. All groups that are discriminated against should uphold their rights, e.g. Roma people should be educated so that they can fight for their right to be registered. Mr CASHMAN said that funds could be sought from the EU; however he warned that it is easier to gain funding for specific projects and plans than for individual proposals. He advised all of the groups to team up and launch a joint programme against discrimination. Regarding this possible joint programme, he suggested simple banner headings, such as \u2018Discrimination Kills\u2019, which represents the issue that ultimately affects everyone, regardless of the discriminated group. To conclude, Mr CASHMAN called on the European Institutions to start actions against the Member States where discrimination is the most prevalent. He reminded the audience of the legal possibilities of infringement proceedings and petitions. The second round of observations was made by Angelika WERTHMANN, a Member of the European Parliament, who expressed her support for a joint programme similar to that suggested by Mr CASHMAN. She highlighted the need for a programme that represents all discriminated groups, addresses all forms of discrimination and is cross-sectoral. Ms WERTHMANN then described the type of activities that the European Parliament\u2019s Petition Committee might do for people who experience discrimination. She referred to a recent petition filed with the Committee by the World Blind Union 41 . The petition was filed on the ground that visually impaired people face discrimination in their everyday lives. For example, visually impaired people have only a few books available on the market that they can read, as opposed to the millions of books to which healthy citizens have access. Discrimination breaches European values and laws, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The third question was posed by Ann Isabelle VON LINGEN, representing the European AIDS Treatment Group 42 . She referred to the complexity of discrimination and, in particular, to the fact that discrimination often occurs as a result of numerous and varied factors. As an example, she referred to the lack of testing of LGBT people. She said that doctors often fail to prescribe HIV tests to their patients, as they are unaware of their sexual orientation or sexual practices. This situation could be overcome by enhancing dialogue at the local level and, regarding this point, she referred to a recent project in Berlin which aims to intensify dialogue between patients and their doctors. She warned, however, that projects similar to this are time-consuming and, thus, there is a need to develop other actions, e.g. the improvement of community-based services which can provide tailored-made services, e.g. counselling and specific tests for HIV and syphilis which are spreading amongst the gay community. Regarding the role of the EU, she referred to the need of training activists and lawyers who can enforce the right for protection against discrimination. She also called on the EU to establish recommendations or guidelines for administrative authorities dealing with the most vulnerable groups, e.g. undocumented migrants. Undocumented migrants often face administrative burdens and have no access to social or healthcare services. 41 More information on the petition is available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20120216IPR38346/html/Binding-rules-to-ensure- blind-people's-access-to-books. 42 More information on the European AIDS Treatment Group is available at: http://www.eatg.org/aboutus. ",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 17 Amongst the speakers, Prof. THORNICROFT commented on the difficulty of disclosing mental problems in Europe. He argued that people often feel ashamed to declare themselves as mentally ill. In the UK, some politicians have recently disclosed their own mental problems. He was not aware of any such case at the European Parliament. Prof. THORNICROFT welcomed the idea of launching a joint programme against discrimination that addresses all forms of discrimination and represents all groups that are discriminated against. Mr BABAJEE welcomed the banner head line \u2018Discrimination Kills\u2019. Based on what he had heard from previous speakers he realised that, regardless of the group, the forms of discrimination are the same, e.g. disclosure of a certain state seems to be difficult for all groups. Regarding non-disclosure, Mr MANDACHE described the situation of the Roma in Romania. In 2011 there was a survey conducted in Romania where people were asked about their ethnicity. The results show that many people with Roma origins did not declare themselves as Roma. Mr MANDACHE explained that Romani CRISS conducted a study to understand the reasons behind the results. They found that many people failed to make such a declaration for fear of marginalisation and discrimination. Another reason was the lack of knowledge, as many Roma were unaware of the meaning of the term \u2018ethnicity\u2019 which was used in the survey. Mr MANDACHE also stated that highly educated Roma often hide their ethnic origin because they fear that, as Roma persons, they would not be as successful. The second part of the workshop, dedicated to the topic \u2018Developing Policies\u2019 was introduced by Mr PETERLE. This part was presented by representatives of the European Union\u2019s Fundamental Agency and a medical doctor representing the Italian Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty. He stressed that the second part of the workshop focused on the types of measures that are available to address discrimination. Prior to handing over to the speakers, he commented that problems in the healthcare sector often arise from the lack of respect towards each other, and amongst the potential measures, he referred to the important role played by education. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 18 2.3 Developing policies 2.3.1 Multiple discrimination in healthcare Mr Ioannis N. DIMITRAKOPOULOS, Head of Department Equality and Citizens' Rights, EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) Access to healthcare is a fundamental right, and is recognised by many international and European legal instruments as well as by Member States\u2019 legislation. Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU recognises the right to be free from discrimination, including on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief. Article 35 guarantees the right of access to preventive healthcare and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices. These principles should be safeguarded by the EU Member States. Despite the legal obligations in place, practices differ across the EU. Research shows that persons belonging to ethnic minorities and, in particular, Roma people, migrants (especially irregular migrants), pregnant women and children, often experience inequalities while accessing healthcare services 43 . To overcome this situation the EU Health Strategy 44 aims to remove and reduce all health inequalities. Removing such inequalities becomes more important today as European healthcare systems are struggling to balance conflicting considerations of cost and public health concerns. The economic crisis and an ageing population present considerable challenges to Member States trying to reduce public spending, including healthcare and, at the same time, fulfilling their duty to protect the right to health. This is particularly important in the context of the EU 2020 Strategy for growth 45 which is underpinned by commitment to high-quality healthy lives and the removal of healthcare inequalities in order to ensure that everybody can benefit from growth. Regarding this point, Mr Dimitrakopoulos stated that it is a Member State competence to define the appropriate health policies and legislation, to manage health expenditure, to allocate resources in line with the obligation arising from EU law \u2013 which is to ensure that no one is directly or indirectly discriminated against when accessing healthcare. FRA has recently published an opinion 46 on the implementation of the Equality Directives 47 , and concluded that barriers and inequalities still exist. According to Mr Dimitrakopoulos the adoption of the Horizontal Directive 48 on discrimination might resolve some of the problems by extending protection against discrimination to all grounds and all sectors, including health. 43 E.g. Results of EU-MIDIS provide examples to health inequalities, which is available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2011/eu-midis-european-union-minorities-and-discrimination-survey. 44 White Paper, Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013, COM (2007) 630 final, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/doc/whitepaper_en.pdf. 45 Communication from the Commission, Europe 2020- A Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, COM(2010) 2020 final, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:2020:FIN:EN:PDF. 46 FRA Opinion on the situation of equality in the European Union 10 years on from initial implementation of the equality directives, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/opinion/2013/fra-opinion-situation-equality-european- union-10-years-initial-implementation-equality. 47 Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC and Employment Equality Directive 2000/78/EC. 48 Proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion of belied, disability, age or sexual orientation, COM/2008/0426 final, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&val=473800. ",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 19 Mr Dimitrakopoulos explained that the fulfilment of the fundamental right to health concerns three important interrelated issues, the first of which is health inequalities. Health inequalities mainly concern people with lower educational levels, job status or income, as they often live and work in less favourable conditions, face more diseases, receive poor quality healthcare and often die young. To illustrate the poor health conditions of the most vulnerable groups, Mr Dimitrakopoulos said that there is abundance of evidence highlighting the very poor living and working conditions of many migrants and ethnic minorities, including the Roma. A recent FRA survey 49 , targeting the Roma in 11 Member States, revealed that one out of three respondents aged 35 to 54 felt that their health problems limited their daily activities. Another survey found that twice as many Roma women aged 50 and above, declare their health conditions as \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019 compared to non-Roma women of the same age group 50 . Situations similar to these are considered as manifestations of health inequalities. As a second issue limiting the right of access to healthcare, Mr Dimitrakopoulos referred to the lack of universal health coverage, which according to the World Health Organization is necessary to ensure that all people obtain health services 51 . To scale the problem, Mr Dimitrakopoulos mentioned a recent FRA briefing 52 , which found that almost 20% of the Roma do not have medical insurance, or they do not know if they are covered by any medical insurance. Mr Dimitrakopoulos also illustrated the vulnerable situation of irregular migrants by stating that, in 19 EU Member States, irregular migrants are entitled to receive only emergency healthcare services 53 ; moreover in 11 out of 19 Member States, irregular migrants are asked to pay for emergency healthcare. In Mr Dimitrakopoulos\u2019s view, despite the fact that it is a human rights obligation for the Member States to allow access to their healthcare services, they are reluctant to do so, due to its possible financial implications. FRA finds that a lack of evidence on the financial implications of delaying treatment of irregular migrants is blocking policy makers from promoting access to healthcare for this group. Moreover, cost-effectiveness is one of the discussion topics of the current debates on access to necessary healthcare for irregular migrants. To provide evidence of the financial benefits of providing access to healthcare services, FRA has recently conducted a study comparing the costs of emergency treatments and timely interventions 54 . The results showed that costs linked to early intervention were lower than those linked to emergency treatment. Thus, Mr Dimitrakopoulos concluded that the promotion of access to healthcare should be seen as a cost-effective measure. 49 FRA, \u2018The situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2099-FRA-2012-Roma-at-a-glance_EN.pdf. 50 FRA, \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ep- request-roma-women.pdf. 51 Universal health coverage is a goal to ensure that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them.

",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 20 The third aspect of access to healthcare was linked to barriers and discrimination. Mr Dimitrakopoulos first clarified that the notions of \u2018barriers\u2019 and \u2018discrimination\u2019 were distinct. \u2018Discrimination\u2019 was defined as the unequal treatment of a person because of one or more personal characteristics, such as age, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. \u2018Barriers\u2019 include mechanisms or structures that impede or delay access to health services, or which reduce their quality or effectiveness. To illustrate the difference, Mr Dimitrakopoulos referred to service costs applied in a uniform manner, which could be seen as barriers \u2013 but not as manifestations of discrimination. Some barriers, however, constitute instances of indirect discrimination 55 . Mr Dimitrakopoulos said that \u2018one-size-fits- all\u2019 measures often result in indirect discrimination. For example, a person with intellectual disability cannot receive the same treatment as a healthy patient, as they cannot communicate with the healthcare providers in the same way as others. Therefore, the universalistic approaches of many healthcare systems should be reviewed and adapted to the special needs. EU law currently protects against direct and indirect forms of discrimination only on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin and gender, and provides no protection against the combination of these grounds. FRA\u2019s research has shown that, in the healthcare sector, people face unequal treatment often because of a combination of their characteristics. This type of discrimination, i.e. where two or more grounds interact in an articulated way, is commonly called multiple or intersectional discrimination 56 . Mr Dimitrakopoulos stated that a combination of grounds make certain groups particularly vulnerable, e.g. older migrants, i.e. on the grounds of their age and ethnic origin, young female workers, i.e. on the grounds of gender and age, or Muslim women, on the grounds of gender, religion and ethnicity. A FRA report 57 also found that groups defined by more than one characteristic often faced both barriers and health inequalities. Moreover, healthcare providers are often not prepared to meet the needs of specific groups and are therefore unable to treat them equally. FRA also found that some healthcare users who believe that they have been treated unequally may react in ways that can affect their health, if, for example, they were to avoid using healthcare services. As an additional difficulty, Mr Dimitrakopoulos referred to the unreported forms of discrimination, which often occur as patients are unaware of their rights, or due to the complex redress systems are unable to enforce their rights. The research also revealed that lawyers are reluctant to litigate on the ground of discrimination, as the compensation awarded to their clients is rather low. Considering this, Mr Dimitrakopoulos said, that in order to improve access to redress, compensation should be proportionate and dissuasive, redress mechanisms should be enhanced and healthcare users should be informed of the existence and function of available legal remedies. 55 Indirect discrimination refers to a neutral provision that has a disproportionate effect on certain people, because of one of their characteristics. 56 FRA \u2018Inequalities and multiple discrimination in access to and quality of healthcare\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2013/inequalities-discrimination-healthcare. 57 Ibid. ",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 21 To conclude, Mr Dimitrakopoulos called on the EU to provide increased legal protection against discrimination and, in particular, to extend the scope of application of EU law to all sectors \u2013 including the sector of health, and to all grounds. Mr Dimitrakopoulos also said that the promotion of positive measures, such as the increase of free language assistance by translators and interpreters, was equally important. Finally, a recent FRA research 58 was presented which concluded that discrimination in clinical practice is rare. According to Mr Dimitrakopoulos it shows that health professionals are generally reluctant to acknowledge that unequal treatment can be present in healthcare. The general obligation of treating each patient equally and with respect is embedded in their key ethnical codes, such as the Hippocratic Oath. Despite this, health professionals may not easily recognise that their own working practices, or their deeply-ingrained stereotyping of certain groups of patients can inadvertently affect the rights of particular groups of healthcare users. Therefore the FRA calls on health professionals to better reflect on how equalities are ensured in practices across all levels of healthcare. 2.3.2 Daily tackling and resolving discrimination in healthcare Dr Gianfranco COSTANZO - Head of Unit for International relations, National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (IT) Dr Costanzo provided a practical insight into the way the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (the National Institute) 59 tackles discrimination on a daily basis. Article 32 of the Italian Constitution 60 states that the Republic safeguards health as a fundamental right of each individual and as a collective interest, and guarantees free medical care for the poor. In addition, under the Italian Unique Text on Immigration 61 , certain health services are provided by the National Institute free-of-charge for undocumented migrants. These services include healthcare for children, maternal care, compulsory vaccination, urgent outpatient and hospital care. Dr Costanzo described an algorithm showing that general access to the healthcare services is quite complex for non-EU national migrants. Despite the initial complexities, the Italian system allows a number of exemptions for migrants, including exemption from co-paying the costs of these healthcare services. Dr Costanzo emphasised that the Italian system aims to eliminate health inequalities, since this might lead to discrimination and in particular to discrimination against non-EU migrants. Furthermore, discrimination may increase and generate more poverty, social exclusion, and also increase the occurrence of diseases. Thus discrimination should be eliminated. To address health inequalities and discrimination against migrants in the sector of health, the National Parliament decided to launch a public policy with the aim of helping the national health services understand the needs of these vulnerable groups, including migrants.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 22 Therefore, as part of this public policy, the Ministry of Health established the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty, which is a public body based in Rome. The remit of the Institute covers the development of approaches for dealing with the most vulnerable groups, research activities, and the organisation and operation of training. Amongst the most vulnerable groups, the Institute\u2019s work mainly focuses on migrants and poor people. Dr Costanzo said that whilst developing the approaches to be followed by the healthcare system, the Institute pays particular attention to cost-efficiency. Regarding cost- efficiency, Dr Costanzo stated that allowing migrants\u2019 access to larger scale outpatient healthcare services is more cost-efficient than only giving them access to the emergency services since the costs of such services are, as a general rule, much higher than those linked to the costs of preventive healthcare. Dr Costanzo continued with a description of the types of services that the National Institute provides to the most vulnerable groups, which mainly include specialist services, e.g. laboratory testing, dermatology services, internal medicine, paediatrics, gynaecology, and odontoiatrics. To make the best use of such services the National Institute has mapped potential accessibility issues that the most vulnerable groups may face, i.e. physical accessibility, relational accessibility and economic accessibility. Physical accessibility is an issue for migrants who might undertake work activities and to address this, Dr Costanzo reported that the National Institute is open seven days per week, has opening hours during the afternoons, has no waiting list, and special care services are accessible without prior referral by the general practitioners. Dr Costanzo then explained relational accessibility as the relationship between health professionals and their patients. Relational accessibility is typically hampered by linguistic and cultural barriers, i.e. 74% of the patients attending the National Institute are migrants who rarely speak Italian. To overcome the linguistic barriers, the National Institute provides multilingual information in the form of brochures, questionnaires and national language news items on its website. Since cultural barriers hinder the understanding of the needs of the most vulnerable groups, such barriers have been reduced by employing, for instance, transcultural mediators. The transcultural mediators are trained staff who speak several foreign languages and because of these technical and cultural skills, they serve as a \u2018bridge\u2019 between the health staff and their patients, facilitating easier access to the healthcare services. Furthermore, transcultural mediators are involved throughout the whole duration of the migrant patients\u2019 clinical paths, i.e. from registration to the conclusion of the medical treatment. Dr Costanzo explained that he found the problems and types of economic barriers that migrant patients face too inter-sectorial and complex to expand on them at this point. However he referred to the National Institute\u2019s current projects involving the management of projects funded by the Ministry of health to support free-of-charge provision of medical devices. 2.3.3 Second round of questions and answers Mr Alojz PETERLE took the floor first and asked Dr Gianfranco COSTANZO about the idea behind the establishment of the National Institute. Dr COSTANZO explained that the Institute initially started working as an experimental joint project of three Italian regions, i.e. Lazio, Puglia and Sicily, since these regions were the most affected by migration. After this experimental phase, which lasted about three years, the Government with the support of 20 regions, decided to stabilise the legal status of the project and therefore established the National Institute. ",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 23 Ms Ann Isabelle VON LINGEN representing the European AIDS Treatment Group, whilst commenting on the work of the National Institute, stated that the set-up of the Institute proves that, sometimes, it is more beneficial to approach target groups directly instead of waiting for them to come and ask for support. The European Institutions, including the working groups of the European Parliament play a crucial role in giving publicity to such cases, and more \u2018good practice\u2019 cases need to be highlighted as NGOs often see the reluctance of the Member States to provide services to the most vulnerable groups. Ms VON LINGEN also emphasised the need to involve the relevant communities in these projects. As a good practice example, she referred to European projects that operate under the supervision of steering groups in which the relevant communities are involved. Mr PETERLE\u2019s second question was also addressed to Dr COSTANZO. He asked if there were volunteers involved in the activities of the National Institute. Dr COSTANZO explained that the Institute was a public body with regular staff members. However, the Institute is currently developing a network which aims to involve all types of stakeholders, including public bodies and volunteer organisations. This network will assist the Institute in defining the needs of the most vulnerable groups. Ms Glennis WILLMOTT asked Dr COSTANZO if the cost-effectiveness of the Institute\u2019s services has ever been assessed. In particular, Ms WILLMOTT asked if the approach towards the types of services provided by the Institute have changed as a result of the current financial crisis. Dr COSTANZO, in his response, said that prior to establishing the Institute, the National Government conducted a feasibility study which compared the costs linked to specialised services and to emergency treatment. The ratio of cost-efficiency was 1:12; in other words the costs of the emergency treatment services were 12 times more than those linked to specialised care. Mr Marian MANDACHE asked the audience for their thoughts on the link between the right to life and the imposition of taxes on emergency services. In his view, it breaches human rights, that in some countries, only those who have medical insurance or who pay the related costs, can benefit from emergency treatment \u2013 including life-saving emergency treatment. According to Mr MANDACHE, such practices breach the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Ioannis DIMITRAKOPOULOS responded by stressing that there are more urgent issues in the EU than those linked to access to emergency treatment. Access to emergency treatment is universal in all EU Member States. He acknowledged, however, that despite legal guarantees, discrimination might occur in some Member States. He further stressed that addressing these issues falls under the Member States\u2019 competences. To ensure that discrimination cases are adequately addressed, the Member States should ensure that patients are informed of their rights and put in place effective redress mechanisms. Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS stressed that, in his view, instead of discrimination, patients often face barriers. He also commented that he had never heard of such a case where a person was thrown out from a hospital on the ground that he belonged to a certain group. He acknowledged, however, that sometimes there are requirements that patients cannot fulfil and are, thus, prevented from accessing healthcare services, e.g. a hospital might forbid the presence of younger relatives (who often speak the local language) during the examination of older patients who do not speak the language of the country and due to this linguistic barrier, these patients might not be able to communicate with the clinical staff and as a result, they do not receive the appropriate treatment. Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS concluded that looking at barriers similar to those he mentioned is more urgent than addressing the potential issues linked to the provision of emergency services. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.752 24 Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS further commented that currently applicable legislation does not allow the EU to legislate in all areas and all grounds, and that the EU has no legislative power to address issues linked to those barriers. He also referred to other legal issues that concern national level legislation. He noted that despite the legislation in place, the number of complaints lodged with the national equality bodies is low. Equality bodies, in his view, should ease the procedures to lodge complaints and to make sure that they keep track of the discrimination cases. Regarding this point, Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS noted that complaints are not necessarily followed by procedures, e.g. they are dismissed on the ground of lack of evidence of discrimination. Mr PETERLE then asked Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS about the type of discrimination they focus on the most. Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS stressed that the FRA does not follow any sort of hierarchy. Their activities cover a wide-range of discrimination grounds, including discrimination by age, disability, ethnic and racial origin, and sexual orientation. Regarding the current activities of the FRA, Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS referred to an on-going survey which serves as an update of the 2008 survey called EU-MIDIS 62 . EU-MIDIS targeted about 25,000 immigrants and persons belonging to ethnic minorities from the 27 EU Member States. Based on the results of the on-going and the 2008 surveys, the EU will be able to assess the effectiveness of applicable legislation in the field of antidiscrimination. A similar survey was conducted last year for LGBT people 63 , the result of which showed that there is an issue in the sector of healthcare. The survey also revealed that direct discrimination by health professionals is rare, whereas LGBT people often experience health barriers. According to Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS, barriers are easier to deal with. This is despite the fact that many health professionals claim that there are no such barriers in Europe. The survey showed that barriers are often linked to the time-constraints faced by health professionals. Due to their schedules, health professionals do not find the time to deal with patients with special needs. Mr DIMITRAKOPOULOS, again, emphasised that addressing issues of this sort is a Member State competence. Nevertheless, he noted that the EU could show good practices to the Member States. Some good practices could be established by EU level legislation, such as the Cross-Border Health Services Directive 64 , which put in place the minimum standards that could influence practices at the national level. Ms VON LINGEN commented on the discussion of cost-effectiveness by saying that the European AIDS Treatment Group also puts emphasis on the lower costs linked to prevention compared to the costs of emergency treatment. She gave an example of a practice, which she was aware of, and which concerned access to emergency treatment and the costs linked to it. The case quoted an asylum seeker who needed medical treatment. 62 More information on EU-MIDIS is available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2011/eu-midis-european-union-minorities-and-discrimination-survey. 63 FRA \u2018EU LGBT survey- European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey- Results at a glance\u2019, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2013/eu-lgbt-survey-european-union-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and- transgender-survey-results. 64 Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare, OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45\u201365, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?T1=V3&T2=2011&T3=24&RechType=RECH_naturel&Submit=Search. ",
        "Workshop on Discrimination in Healthcare PE 518.752 25 The authorities deported the asylum seeker on the ground that such treatment is costly and should be provided to the asylum-seeker in his country of origin. In her view, such a decision breached the right to life, since the treatment that the asylum-seeker needed was not available in his country of origin. She said that issues similar to this should be taken into account whilst having a discussion on cost-effective measures. Dr COSTANZO said that asylum-seekers in Italy are registered as Italian nationals, thus the question was irrelevant in the light of the National Institute\u2019s activities. He reminded the audience of the special status of stateless persons who are not entitled to any health benefits. These groups are even more disadvantaged than, e.g. migrants. Thus, whilst designing any measures, it is particularly important to map the characteristics and needs of the targeted group. Ms Sarada DAS from the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) thanked all the speakers for their valuable input which CPME could use in putting forward recommendations for its members. Ms DAS asked Dr COSTANZO if medical doctors are contacted through national or regional medical associations, or if are approached individually. Dr COSTANZO answered that the National Institute has an extensive network, which involves both national and regional medical associations. 2.3.4 Conclusions In his concluding remarks, Mr Peterle emphasised the importance of the topic and stated that, regardless of the results of the European Parliament elections in 2014, the topic will remain high on the political agenda. He stressed that workshops similar to this could help people become better informed. Ms Willmott also highlighted the importance of the topic and called on all actors to work together. She finally concluded that projects similar to the one suggested by Mr Cashman should be supported. ",

He is a Consultant Psychiatrist working in an Early Intervention community mental health team in South London, and is Director of King\u2019s Improvement Science. His areas of expertise include: mental health needs assessment, the development of new outcome scales, cost-effectiveness evaluation of mental health treatments, stigma and discrimination, the development of community-based mental health services, and global mental health. He has published 29 books and 333 peer-reviewed scientific papers (e.g. Discrimination against People with Mental Illness, Self-stigma, empowerment and perceived discrimination among people with bipolar disorder or depression in 13 European countries: The GAMIAN- Europe study, Global pattern of experienced and anticipated discrimination against people with schizophrenia: a cross-sectional survey, etc.). Mr Anthony Babajee Unashamedly positive, Ant Babajee has been living with HIV since 2007. He grew up in south-west England and currently lives in London. Ant came out as gay at the age of 19 during the first year of a German and history degree. Being mixed race (with a father from Mauritius), gay and HIV-positive, Ant jokes that on diversity monitoring forms he has to tick lots of boxes! Ant currently works as a marketer and graphic designer, but his background is in broadcast journalism, including five years at the BBC. As he regained confidence after his HIV diagnosis, Ant has sought to use his media skills to talk about his experiences of living with the virus. Even though he is open to his wonderfully supportive friends and family, the biggest challenge Ant faces is disclosing his positive status to new people he meets, such is the stigma that still surrounds HIV 30 years after the first cases emerged. Ant has talked about openly living with HIV as a gay man in numerous interviews on radio, television and the web. He has appeared in the national and local media in the UK \u2013 on ITV News, Gaydio and numerous BBC local radio stations. In early 2013, he was featured in FS magazine, published by sexual-health charity GMFA, as a gay community role model. Ant has been volunteering with Terrence Higgins Trust, Europe\u2019s largest HIV and sexual- health charity, since 2010 and became a trustee at the end of 2013. He supports other people living with the virus around Britain as the volunteer moderator on the myHIV web forum. He also volunteers with THT\u2019s health improvement team on the London gay scene as well as with GMFA. Ant is also a member of UK-CAB, a network of HIV treatment advocates, and ReShape \u2013 a recently formed HIV and hepatitis C thinktank. Ant is an avid tweeter as @t4rdis \u2013 he is a fan of British sci-fi series Doctor Who \u2013 and regularly discusses LGBT and HIV issues with his followers. He also posts to his Tumblr blog at t4rdis.me. ",
