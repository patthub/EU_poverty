        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background The Europe 2020 strategy was presented in 2010 and should provide the basis for Europe towards 2020. The strategy is the follow up to the Lisbon strategy, and it intends to avoid the mistakes of the past. Together with its embedded seven Flagship initiatives, the strategy establishes synergies between different thematic fields and addresses different levels. The Flagship initiatives form pathways in thematic areas such as innovation, digitalisation, poverty, employment, industry, youth and resource efficiency. The thematic fields cover many different European and national policy fields and relate to different European instruments and in particular to the Cohesion Policy instruments. Europe 2020 replaces the Lisbon agenda. The thematic impact of the Lisbon agenda can be found in various policies and instruments of the European Union. However the economic crisis clearly affected the baseline of the agenda, and consequently its targets could not be achieved. However, it is questionable whether the failure was due only to the crisis or if implementation was weak from the beginning. A recent evaluation 1 identified many different challenges associated with the Lisbon agenda, most of all its complexity and the lack of adoption by Member States. Among others, the Cohesion Policy programmes have been drafted utilising the so-called \u2018Lisbon codes\u2019. This \u2018Lisbonisation\u2019 of Cohesion Policy had a major impact on the thematic allocation, but the process still lacked the necessary ownership from the Member States. The thematic approach under Cohesion Policy was pioneered by the Lisbon strategy and provides some important lessons; there are both successes and failures. The current Cohesion Policy proposal for the 2014-2020 programming period is under development and the European Parliament is seeking better implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy at European and (particularly) Member State levels. In this respect, the European Parliament wants national initiatives more closely monitored through observance of the subsidiarity principle, by developing a coherent proposal for financing Europe 2020 objectives, and by ensuring that the policy reforms of the European Commission are aligned with the Europe 2020 Flagship initiatives. 2 Using Cohesion Policy instruments to implement Flagship Initiatives requires attention to their interrelationships. However the coherence between the current Cohesion Policy proposal and the Flagship initiatives is not yet clear. In this respect there is a need for clear roadmaps to indicate how different levels of action and different instruments can contribute to the Flagship initiatives. 1 European Commission (2010), Lisbon Strategy evaluation document, Commission Staff Working Document , SEC(2010),114 final, Brussels, 2.2.2010. 2 European Parliament (2011), Structural and Cohesion Policies for 2020: tools to overcome the crisis , note, Directorate General for Internal Policies Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies, Brussels, November 2011. 15 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies Flagship initiatives and their implementation in European Policies The study presents an overview of the seven Flagship initiatives and shows possible means of implementation within European policies and especially within Cohesion Policy instruments. The Europe 2020 strategy introduces seven Flagship initiatives: 1. Innovative Union 2. A Digital Agenda for Europe 3. An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era 4. Resource-efficient Europe 5. Youth on the Move 6. An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs 7. European Platform against Poverty The Flagship initiatives correspond to the objectives and targets of the strategy. However, the thematic orientation of the Flagship initiatives is multi-dimensional and considers several different levels of action (European Union, Member State, local and regional levels) in order to reach the related Europe 2020 targets. Some of the initiatives evolved from earlier projects and programmes and build on an existing foundation (e.g. Innovation Union, Digital Agenda). This is the reason why those Flagship initiatives are very mature in their development and the related documentation provides detailed action plans for improvement. Other initiatives are less developed (e.g. Platform against Poverty, Youth on the Move). These latter two initiatives are socially-oriented and therefore lack the economic impetus of the previously-mentioned topics. In addition, socially-oriented initiatives are typically more locally and regionally dependent in their implementation than industrial and innovation topics would be. For each of the Flagship initiatives, the study provides a factsheet. The multi-dimensional character of the initiatives implies a certain thematic overlap between different pathways. Flagships do not have their own budgets, and their realisation depends on effective coordination and management of different financial resources. By screening the different documents available about Flagship initiatives, as well as the current Cohesion Policy proposal, it is most obvious that the current Cohesion Policy proposal 3 does not explicitly include the Flagship initiatives, but the communication documents on Flagship initiatives mention several financial support instruments and specifically European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF). Other policy instruments most notably the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the successor Horizon 2020 refer directly and intensively to the relevant Flagship initiatives. Nevertheless, the realisation of Flagship initiatives relies heavily on financial support from Cohesion Policy instruments. 3 European Commission (2011), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of The Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund covered by the Common Strategic Framework and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 {SEC(2011) 1141 final} {SEC(2011) 1142 final, COM(2011) 615 final, Brussels, 6.10.2011. 16 ",
        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy The current Cohesion Policy proposal barely mentions Flagship initiatives. The proposal is oriented along the lines of 11 Thematic Objectives, which cover all the five Funds included in the Community Support Framework (Cohesion Fund (CF), ERDF, ESF, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), European Maritime Fisheries Fund, (EMFF)). However, even though these objectives are very relevant for the Flagship initiatives, they do not consider the action plans proposed in the Flagship communications. In comparing the different thematic objectives, the different funding fields and the thematic orientation of the Flagship initiatives, the following results emerge. For the Flagships \u2018Digital Agenda\u2019, \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 and \u2018Industrial Policy\u2019, the ERDF covers a broad range of relevant themes, but the role of the ERDF in relation to Resource\u2013efficient Europe is less clear. With regard to social factors, the Flagships on \u2018New Skills and Jobs\u2019 and \u2018European Platform against Poverty\u2019 are mostly related to ESF. \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 is somewhat less important in relation to the ESF, but is covered by other non-Cohesion Policy instruments such as the Lifelong Learning Programme. EAFRD and the EMFF directly mention the contribution to innovation, improvement of ICT infrastructure, resource efficiency, support for SMEs and skills development. Examples of Lisbon implementation in the current programming period Overall, the Lisbon strategy impacted on the current 2007-2013 programming period thematically and in terms of the involvement of the regional and local level. The largest impact can be identified in the National Reference Framework Programmes and the Operational Programmes. Concerning the involvement of stakeholders at central and regional level, in most cases only the central level has been involved in the elaboration and implementation of Lisbon-relevant topics. The lowest involvement of Lisbon-thematic fields occurred in Member States where hard infrastructure projects are favoured or were inherited from the previous period. Only Member States above a certain GDP/capita and with a longer history of European Membership focused on soft projects that were much more aligned to the Lisbon agenda. The implementation of the Lisbon-thematic fields has been accepted as obligatory in most cases, and Managing Authorities aligned Operational Programme budgets in more or less arbitrary ways. In some instances, Lisbon codes were matched ex post to existing strategies. The same is true for some programming processes that involved the regional and local levels. The differences between those who involved regional stakeholders in the whole programming processes and those who viewed the involvement as an inevitable burden are strikingly related to Member States with decentralised administrations and Member States with centralised administrations respectively. Further differences emerge in Member States where the size of the country demands a more decentralised approach. Another difference occurs between hard infrastructure projects and softer innovation and social projects. While the former are managed more centrally, the latter are managed at regional or local level. The choice between central or regional implementation is also a question of efficiency; Member States regionalised by necessity rather than heritage (e.g. because of their size, such as in Poland) are facing this dilemma more directly and with various levels of success. Some thematic fields and broad policies (e.g. digital agenda) are spread over national and regional Operational Programmes and are implemented in a mixed way. The monitoring process of the Lisbon implementation has not been obligatory and therefore the updated indicative budget allocation is not reflected in most of the Annual Implementation Reports. In practice, some Member States did involve the codes in the 17 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies reporting scheme, but the difference in reporting does not allow any comprehensive evaluation of the Lisbonisation. The various ways of implementing Lisbon-aligned projects show that no generalisation of good and bad implementation is possible. However, the case studies reveal that the most successful projects have been those with a certain umbrella character. In Sweden, the \u2018A&O\u2019 is one of the ESF\u2019s five national theme groups disseminating experiences from the projects. The A&O is charged with compiling, analysing and sharing experiences from workplace-learning-related projects. The objective is to promote the value of continuous workplace-learning to labour market parties such as employer organisations and policy- makers. The Irish \u2018Equal at Work\u2019 labour market programme has focused on reforming and developing HR policies and practice to create a more equal and accessible labour market. Activation measures are targeted at employers, service producers and disadvantaged groups (older people, people with disabilities, travellers, lone parents, women, ethnic minorities and refugees) across the four main employment sectors in Ireland, namely the health sector, public local government sector, the private sector, and the very large community and voluntary sector. In Poland, no particular project was chosen as a case study. Instead, the Polish administration pointed out the general implementation of the innovation topic using a combined top-down (centralised Operational Programme) and bottom-up (each Voivodship 4 has an Innovation Programme) approach for implementing the thematic field. Cross-border programmes are very much bottom-up with a substantial involvement of regional and local stakeholders. However, cross-border projects contend with different problems such as language and cultural barriers. In those cases, more soft projects are implemented supporting different economic interaction across the border. In some instances, it has been proven that the involvement of too many administrative levels can hinder fruitful project generation. In Greece, for example, the central management avoided the involvement of local administration and directly engaged beneficiaries in implementing resource-efficient systems. This approach most likely saved considerable administrative effort. Although different in their thematic orientation and management, the case studies show only a small picture of the European implementation of the Lisbon agenda. Nevertheless, it is evident from the case studies that the implementation process concerns not only the project level but also the whole programme management cycle and broader context. However, the recent financial crisis in 2008 had a deep impact on the current 2007-13 programming period. As the Lisbon agenda was designed before 2008, some aspects were inappropriate and not required during the crisis period. Although the Lisbon agenda was moving in the right direction, it lacked a certain consistency in its implementation, and therefore Member States saw the whole exercise as having little practical value. 4 Administrative area in Poland 18 ",
        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy Roadmaps for Flagship initiatives In order to show an implementation path for the Flagship initiatives, they were subjected to a universal roadmap grid, in each case defining and answering the questions of who does what, at which level, when and how. Detailed pictures were drawn for each Flagship initiative, but there is no common approach in implementation. Specific Flagship initiatives foresee considerable work at the EU level in the short term (e.g. \u2018Digital Agenda\u2019 and \u2018Industrial Policy\u2019), whereas others operate at the MS level with activities over the medium- to-long term (e.g. \u2018European Platform against Poverty\u2019). The characterisation as short-, medium- or long-term action is dependent on the Member State and its respective governance structures. Actions to be implemented in the short term in more-developed regions are often long-term issues in less-developed regions. By contrast, when considering funds and policy instruments, a fairly universal pattern is visible. Whereas Horizon 2020 is more or less a universal instrument relevant to almost all Flagship initiatives, other instruments focus on specific activities. In the sphere of Cohesion Policy, a clear division of tasks is identifiable, with ERDF covering the hard factors (i.e. physical infrastructure) and ESF encompassing the soft elements (i.e. human resources and skills). EAFRD and EFF are complementary to ERDF in their respective environments, and the Cohesion Fund assumes responsibility for some hard factors where applicable, mainly related to the Flagship \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019. However, each roadmap covers activities at the European, Member State, regional and local levels. The activities are listed in detail and clustered between Member States dominated by transition and developed regions and Member States dominated by less-developed regions. The following paragraphs provide a summary of the roadmaps. The Flagship initiative Innovation Union has the aim of supporting research, development and innovation policies on topics such as climate change, energy and resource efficiency, health and demographic change. The Flagship imitative should provide synergies between the various policies and instruments at European and Member State levels. Different European instruments are involved (e.g. Seventh Framework Programme for research, Lifelong Learning Programme, ERDF, ESF, etc), especially in this thematic field, but Member States also have national and regional policies and programmes related to this field. The Flagship initiative provides the opportunity to establish a unified innovation framework; however, it must establish a compromise between the pursuit of cohesion and the promotion of excellence. On one side, there is increasing global competitiveness, and on the other side there is scarce public funding and a fragmented operating environment. At the EU level, an extensive set of actions is detected in the short term for the definition and standardisation of the framework and the launch of specific support mechanisms (e.g. on mobility of researchers). These activities serve the purposes of coherence and performance in the medium term, leading to the enhancement of the European Research Area in the long term. At the Member States and local and regional levels, no novel breakthroughs are necessary; instead, steady and coherent steps to improve existing structures, adjustment and coordination of tools, and improvement of the research infrastructure are required. The Flagship initiative Digital Agenda has the aim of supporting the Digital Single Market by improving fast and ultra-fast internet and interoperable applications. This includes broadband access for all regions in Europe by 2013, increased internet speeds (30 Mbps or above) by 2020, and more than 50 percent of European households connected to internet with a speed above 100 Mbps. The Flagship initiative concentrates on the broad improvement of the \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 factors concerning ICT. The potential of a single market framework for ICT and the potent market drive on ICT are significant drivers of success related to this initiative. On the other side, the market orientation might also lead 19 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies to market failures, which will require some form of public intervention. This is especially true in the EU-12, which often lack a sufficient basic infrastructure in their ICT network. At the EU level, in the short term the build-up of a legal and procedural framework including guidance to the Member States is foreseen. This will lead to the establishment of capable European agencies and the definition of an interoperable and cross-border network in the medium term, and to Europe-wide e-governance in the long term. At the MS and local and regional levels, the focus is on the enhancement of ICT skills in the short-to-medium term and the improvement of the infrastructure in the medium-to-long term. The Flagship initiative An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era concentrates on economic, business and labour force aspects considering among others innovation, resource efficiency, business environment, the Single Market and the improvement of SME support. However, this broad thematic spectrum can lead to a loss of focus, and competition between Member States, the lack of coordination and the deepening of existing disparities also jeopardise effectiveness. At the EU level, the establishment of an EU Industrial Policy in the short term is the cornerstone, accompanied by related regulations and guidance. In the medium-to-long term, the horizontal approach to industrial policy, the enhancement of EU standards and the promotion of resource efficiency are identified as paramount challenges. At the MS and local and regional levels, the focus in the short-to-medium term is on the enhancement of skills, the reduction of the administrative burden for SMEs, and the guarantee of a stable and trustworthy operational environment for SMEs. The restructuring of industries and the promotion of resource efficiency are mentioned for the medium term, and the utilisation of telematics and the creation of efficient transport and logistics networks are a long-term issue. The Flagship initiative Resource-efficient Europe covers a very broad spectrum concerning resource efficiency and environmental protection related to all policies and programmes at European and national levels, emphasising the horizontal character of the topic. However, this horizontal dimension means that effectiveness and efficiency will only be generated through EU-wide implementation. The EU\u2019s fast-growing \u2018green\u2019 industry can be a powerful global asset. At the same time, globalised industrial competition confronts European industry with low-price products and low environmental standards, making the adoption of rigid legal changes towards resource efficiency less welcome. At the EU level, a long list of activities is envisaged for the short term, covering the formulation of new visions and strategies (e.g. on biodiversity), the review of existing policies, operationalisation via financial instruments, structures and monitoring provisions, amongst others. In the medium term, the establishment of concrete tools is addressed (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment, eco-labelling, Green Public Procurement and others), leading to long- term support for research, the introduction of market-based instruments and the abolition of counter-productive subsidies. At the MS and local and regional levels, the focus in the short term is on the finalisation of the legal and administrative framework (where needed), leading to concrete implementation in the medium-to-long term of very specific actions (e.g. energy efficiency in buildings, development of storage technologies, introduction of fiscal incentives etc.). 20 ",
        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy The Flagship initiative Youth on the Move addresses the high youth unemployment, suggesting actions concerning educational and professional mobility and the facilitation of entry into the labour market. However, the obvious benefit of coordinating and harmonising MS policies and systems is somehow compromised by the long timescale required for investments in education to bear fruit, and connectivity to the local labour market and brain drain can be additional hindrances. At the EU level, the challenge in the short term lies in the definition of an education modernisation agenda to be carried out by the relevant programmes (e.g. Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig, Erasmus Mundus, Tempus) in the medium term. At the MS and local and regional levels, the focus is on immediately improving entry into the labour market, while investments in infrastructure and human resources and the establishment of qualification frameworks in the medium term should lead to improved educational outcomes and reduced drop-out rates in the long term. The Flagship initiative New Skills and Jobs is closely related to \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019, shifting the focus onto vocational training aimed at demand-driven education and on-the- job learning. The main concern lies in matching skills with labour market demand and EU- wide harmonisation. National competences pose a serious obstacle in this field, and national administrations might be too weak or too slow in adapting to the rapid changing needs of businesses, hence the emphasis on on-the-job training approaches. At EU level, the focus in the short term is on a review of the relevant directives and policies, and in the medium term on setting up an Integration Fund for third-country nationals. At the MS and local and regional levels, where the main action is located, the administrations should focus in the short-to-medium term on the improvement of skills, investments in infrastructure, and support of self-employment and entrepreneurship. In the medium-to-long term, the focus shifts to concrete training and skills programmes and Lifelong Learning Frameworks. The establishment of \u2018flexicurity\u2019 frameworks is mentioned as a long-term issue. The Flagship initiative European Platform against Poverty addresses the disparity between wealth and poverty (and underlying unemployment) throughout Europe. The main aim is to make poverty visible on the daily agenda. To facilitate an informed discussion on the topic, the lack of adequate data to support theoretical considerations is addressed. However, this field is not problem-free, as Member States either lack the capacity or willingness (for various reasons) to implement the necessary activities. At the EU level, the promotion of evidence-based research in the short term is a sine qua non , which should lead to the medium-term support of social economy initiatives and partnership. At the MS and local and regional levels, where the main action is located, the administrations should focus on the improvement of policies and coordination in the short term, assisted by evidence-based research in the medium term, which should lead to efficient migration management and flexibility of education and training in the long term. Main findings and recommendations Analysis of the different features of Flagship initiative implementation reveals that the initiatives were defined with the purpose of better guiding the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, this purpose has not been acknowledged when it comes to policy development. Based on the study results, the following recommendations are proposed for the better integration of the Flagships within policy instruments and to assure a coherent alignment during the next programming period. The lessons learned in the implementation of the Lisbon agenda should result in improvements to future strategy implementation. 21 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies The \u2018Lisbonisation\u2019 of the current Cohesion Programming Period at European Union level The Lisbon agenda was a rather top-down strategy that lacked a certain ownership by Member States. Accordingly, it is necessary to break down the strategic and abstract concepts into down-to-earth project ideas that can be comprehended and adopted at the local level. This is a crucial point for both programming and consultation, but also for implementation, allowing easier orientation of the programme bodies and the beneficiaries. These project ideas must be indicative, allowing stakeholders with the necessary capacity to design their interventions but supporting the performance of those less capable. Framework support at the OP level has also proved to be a useful investment, allowing for assistance and guidance at the local level. 1. Currently, European strategies are still perceived as detached and non-applicable. It is necessary to break down European strategies and concepts into understandable and applicable actions that can be adopted at local and regional levels. 2. Managing Authorities have incorporated the earmarking codes into the monitoring system. Now they use these codes as a standard indicator. In order to generate an added value based on this \u2018learning effect\u2019, it would be useful to keep the earmarking code feature for future allocations towards Europe 2020 targets. 3. It is recommended that provisions be introduced for an \u2018automatisation\u2019 between programme implementation progress (as expressed in the financial performance) and \u2018earmarking indicator\u2019 change. Since 2007-2013, programmes have assigned earmarking codes at the \u2018measure level\u2019, and it would be useful to introduce a key of percentile contribution per measure, hence automatically calculating earmarking codes progress as per financial progress. Subsequent revisions of the programme can be easily introduced either at the measure level or in the percentile keys. Such an approach will deliver a fit-for-purpose picture of reality with almost no administrative burden, a constant concern of Managing Authorities and their monitoring departments. 4. Ensuring consistency between European and national instruments must include the management of synergies between the different instruments in place. The implementation of Flagship initiatives using Cohesion Policy instruments The Europe 2020 strategy formed the Flagship initiatives to gain better involvement of the Member States. However, this approach has not yet reached the Member States, and this will not change without consistent implementation of the European financing instruments. Recommendations - European level form a central part of the Europe 2020 strategy, es must be positioned in such a way that Member State lagship initiative roadmaps ires not only allocating Cohesion Policy 5.

The coherence between Flagships and ERDF and ESF must be elaborated and defined in the general regulations of the Cohesion Policy instruments. 10. Indicators defined for Structural Funds evaluation need to reflect the objectives of the Flagships. 11. The duplication of processes and reporting obligations should be avoided and transparency ensured. Recommendations - Member State level 12. When defining Operational Programmes, ring-fencing should be clearly in line with the pathways of the Flagship initiatives. 13. Member States should take into account the objectives and goals of the Flagship initiatives when elaborating their partnership contracts. 14. Given that Flagship initiatives considerations in the partnership contracts and resulting Operational Programmes did not result in any additional funds materialising or any other kind of bonus, the introduction of incentives for the Member States should be considered, so that Flagship initiatives integration goes beyond lip service or simple monitoring relevant intervention codes. Eventually, path-setting projects that refer to one of the Flagship initiatives should be empowered, than, for example, \u2018standard projects of hard infrastructure\u2019. This is especially the case in EU-12 Member States. European Parliament involvement in the implementation process the alignment of Cohesion Policy financing with the Flagship initiatives, agship initiative monitoring, the contribution of thematic input The European Parliament can play an important role in the early stages of actions that define the framework for the implementation of the Flagships. This applies both to the topics identified in the roadmaps (i.e. short-to-medium-term actions at EU level with mainly Type A and eventually Type C activities) and to the form of consultations for the final version of the Structural Funds regulations. 15. The European Parliament should ensure the activities outlined in the roadmaps, as well as monitoring the national implementation of the different steps in the roadmaps. 16. Due to the complexity and thematic broadness of comprehensive monitoring of progress is recommended (e.g. in a form of a mind-map around the Flagship initiatives Communications, indicating previous and subsequent documents). At present, this could be rudimentary, focusing on the generation of supporting documents, but in the short-to-medium term it must become more sophisticated in capturing the new elements, i.e. revision of regulations and new strategies at EU level developed because of the Flagship initiatives, etc. This monitoring could be structured either vertically along the topics of the Flagship initiatives (addressing visibility and comprehension) or horizontally along the type of \u2018products\u2019 concerned (e.g. policies, regulations, structures, monitoring etc., addressing efficiency and coordination). 17. In similar manner to Fl from working groups or committees could be envisaged. In that case, the vertical structure focusing on topics is more manageable, creating dedicated working groups with the necessary expertise. 23 ",

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 1. INTRODUCTION The Lisbon agenda was developed in 2000 to provide a strategy for the European Union for the ten years ahead. The overall aim of the strategy was: for the European Union to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion (European Commission 2000). 5 The agenda was based on four pillars: \uf0b7 Preparing for the transition to a competitive, knowledge-based economy and society. \uf0b7 Modernising the European social model, investing in people and combating social exclusion. \uf0b7 Applying an appropriate macro-economic policy mix. \uf0b7 Sustainable development (added at the G\u00f6teborg European Council meeting in 2001). By 2004, it was clear that the Lisbon strategy was failing to achieve its targets, and a revised strategy was launched in 2005. The re-launched strategy focuses more on a two- dimensional approach, implying a new governance structure between Member States and EU institutions on a partnership basis and an open method of coordination, encouraging Member States to exchange knowledge and cooperate. The renewed strategy covers three main areas: \uf0b7 Knowledge and innovation for growth. \uf0b7 Making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work. \uf0b7 Creating more and better jobs. In 2008, the economic downturn significantly changed the European environment and ore than ever needs to stabilise its competitiveness by providing triggered another revision of the European strategic focus, with an acknowledgement of the most pressing needs: \uf0b7 The European Union m a supportive environment for its research excellence and innovation. The European economy depends heavily on SMEs that must be supported in their growth and development. The European internal market should form a unified and supportive framework for EU enterprises of all sizes. This support should also and most importantly address micro-firms and entrepreneurs as those with the highest risk of failure. 6 5 Lisbon European Council (2000), Presidency Conclusions , 23 and 24 March 2000. 6 European Commission (2011), Industrial Policy: Reinforcing competitiveness , Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2011) 642 final, {SEC(2011) 1187 final}{SEC(2011) 1188 final}, Brussels, 14.10.2011, p. 6. 25 ",

Education and skills development should be improved, starting with young people. lifelong learning and skills development for all ages should be matched with market needs. 7 \uf0b7 Energy efficiency and resource protection provide not only a wide range of competitive challenges but also create new jobs. However, this requires a better education and research environment in relevant thematic fields. Furthermore, the European Union should conduct Europe-wide emissions reduction effectively in all thematic fields. 8 \uf0b7 Healthcare and the integration of elderly people into social life will be a pressing need for the future. In this respect, social inclusion also relates to consistent access to virtual (internet) and actual networks (transport). \uf0b7 Agglomeration and metropolitan areas will be the leading nodes in future development and should be strengthened in the light of their influence on peripheral regions and their hinterlands. 9 \uf0b7 Lastly, increasing poverty encountered at all levels of society is targeted with each measure. Each initiative that supports the above-mentioned issues will also support the fight against poverty and support social inclusion. The post-Lisbon era was triggered in 2008 during the French presidency. The result of this process was the Europe 2020 strategy introduced in 2010, which now forms the basis for implementation of the strategy in the new programming period 2014-2020. The lessons learned in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy can be of substantial help in this process if adopted properly. The Lisbon strategy undoubtedly had positive impacts on the development of the European Union, and its implementation was accompanied by several precarious external influences. The main benefit of the Lisbon strategy was to achieve a broad consensus between Member States in important policy implementation. The Lisbon strategy acknowledged the most pressing needs of the European Union and focused on the most important objectives (human resource development, innovation, labour market). This directly supported citizens and businesses in the European Member States. 10 However, the European Union failed to reach the challenging goals defined in the strategy for several reasons. The fact that the structural-oriented strategy did not have the potential to react adequately to the crisis can be seen as inherent. More striking is that policy instruments were not clearly linked to the strategy goals, and they were not evaluated along Lisbon objectives. The over-complexity of the strategy was an obvious drawback, omitting to clarify the implementation path or responsibilities. Moreover, the lack of synergies between different policy instruments related to overlapping thematic fields led to 7 European Commission (2011), An Agenda for new skills and jobs: A European contribution towards full employment, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions , COM(2010) 682 final, Strasbourg, 23.11.2010, p. 2. 8 European Commission (2011), A resource-efficient Europe \u2013 Flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 Strategy, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions , COM(2011) 21, Brussels, 26.1.2011, p. 3. 9 European Union (2011), Evidence based Cohesion Policy and its role in achieving Europe 2020 objectives , Conference Background Report, 7 July 2011, p. 11. 10 European Commission (2010), Lisbon Strategy evaluation document , Commission Staff Working Document, SEC(2010) 114 final, Brussels, 2.2.2010, p. 3. 26 ",

The targets of earmarked funds even exceeded the original goal and reached 78.8 percent in Competitiveness programmes and 64.5 percent in Convergence programmes. 12 In this respect, the evaluation report praises the role of Cohesion Policy instruments and the emphasis on achieving Lisbon objectives on a multiple-governance level. However, in all fields, substantial drawbacks include the lack of awareness amongst citizens and institutions of the importance of an EU-wide strategy. This lack of awareness is reflected by the relatively slow progress in the \u2018Lisbonisation\u2019 of instruments in some Member States. 13 Moreover, the report stated that implementation lacked strong ownership of governance structures. Although the evaluation paper outlined important issu general level. In terms of Cohesion Policy, a more detailed analysis of strategy implementation was carried out in different Member States and Structural Funds networks. The conclusion of these discussions should be taken into consideration when defining conditions for the new 2014-2020 Structural Funds period. The Europe 2020 strategy now concentrates on similar obje aligned implementation of its goals. Moreover, the Europe 2020 strategy seeks to establish synergies between different thematic fields and implementation levels in order to steer policy implementation towards a common path. The outline of the Europe 2020 strategy covers three priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, including five objectives on employment, innovation, education, social inclusion and climate/energy. 14 Those objectives have been translated into national objectives to secure a more direct influence on Member State policies. To achieve better integration formed that should outline the paths towards the goals and objectives set. The Flagship initiatives currently address a number of different activities at different levels of responsibility (European, Member State, regional and local authority levels), but it is not yet clear how these Flagship initiatives are expected to influence policy instruments in their actual implementation. A significant part of th instruments. Accordingly, the Flagship initiatives should be considered in the current Cohesion Policy discussion for the new 2014-2020 programming period.

For a variety of reasons, implementation and coordination is significant. First of all, within on the involvement of regional and local authorities, has the uence each initiative the EU and national authorities must effectively coordinate their efforts so they are mutually reinforcing.

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY The objective of the study is to provide an overview of the Flagship initiatives and their relevance for future Cohesion Policy. The study proposes a roadmap and advice for the successful implementation of the Flagship initiatives in the coming years. The European Commission and the European Parliament regard the initiatives as major steps in contributing to the Europe 2020 strategy. In short, the study involves the following: \uf0b7 an overview of the Flagship initiatives; \uf0b7 an assessment of the coherence of the proposed Objectives of future Cohesion Policy and the goals of the Flagship initiatives; \uf0b7 analysis of the successes and failures of Lisbon strategy implementation in the current period; \uf0b7 a roadmap and advice for the successful implementation of the Flagship Initiatives in the coming years; \uf0b7 further recommendations on how to improve the integration of the Flagship initiatives. The study is divided into three phases that mirror the different analytical steps in the elaboration process. The objective of the first phase is two-dimensional and includes an outline of the Flagship initiatives and Cohesion Policy after 2013. One output of this study phase comprises factsheets for each Flagship initiative, including the analysis of the FI\u2019s position in the Policy Lifecycle Model. A second result is a comprehensive comparison between the new Cohesion Policy proposal of the European Commission and the Communication documents of the Flagship initiatives. The different Cohesion Policy funds are analysed in detail for their potential contribution towards Flagships and how the relevant documents reflect each other and how the different documents are adjusted to each other. The second phase of the study includes a selection of case studies. The case studies should contribute to a better understanding of how Cohesion Policy instruments have been implemented in line with the Lisbon agenda. Lessons learned should help to formulate and improve the implementation of Europe 2020 in the new programming period. The analysis of the case studies is based on a literature review of the current Strategic Reference Framework and corresponding Operational Programmes of the ERDF and ESF Cohesion Policy funds as well as other national strategy papers. The literature review should establish a picture of the status quo in each sample MS in the particular topics of the Flagship initiatives and where gaps are detected. The main aspects of the analysis are the strategic alignment between national and European policies, the implementation of \u2018Lisbonised\u2019 Operational Programmes, the role of regional and local authorities in the development and implementation process, and finally successful projects in Lisbon-relevant thematic fields. The choice of case studies is based on a preliminary MS grouping according to their total Lisbon-related budget, location, size and Cohesion Policy objectives (Convergence, Regional Competitiveness and Employment and ETC). The selected Member States are Italy, Sweden, Greece, Austria, Ireland and Poland. The Operational Programme SK-AT was chosen for the ETC example. The third phase of the study includes the elaboration of roadmaps for each Flagship initiative. The roadmaps reflect differences according to the types of MS. Finally, the study provides conclusions based on the theoretical analysis and the survey of case studies. The recommendations relate to the roadmaps and how the European Parliament could be involved in their realisation. 29 ",

In this respect, the strategy supports the aim of the single market. \uf0b7 The Flagship initiatives directly correspond to the respective objectives and targets of the strategy. However, the thematic orientation of the Flagship initiatives is multi-dimensional . \uf0b7 The Europe 2020 strategy cited seven Flagship initiatives : (i) An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, (ii) Innovation Union, (iii) a Digital Agenda for Europe, (iv) Resource-efficient Europe, (v) Youth on the Move, (vi) an Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, and (vii) a European Platform against Poverty. \uf0b7 Flagship initiatives cover topics and initiatives already partly elaborated during the current (2007-2013) or previous (1999-2006) programming period. \uf0b7 Each Flagship initiative has a main theme and the specific aim to support the improvement of Europe in that field . The related documents describe actions at different levels of interventions (European level, Member State level, regional and local level). \uf0b7 Flagship initiatives overlap with each other and form pathways for different policy instruments to be used coherently to achieve a common goal. \uf0b7 Activities proposed to Member States are related to Cohesion Policy instruments. This chapter provides an overview of the Flagship initiatives and their relationship to Europe 2020 and the Lisbon strategy, elaborated in the light of the crisis starting in 2008. In order to provide a quick overview, only the main aspects of each initiative are introduced. Further details of the Flagship initiatives and their correlation with Cohesion Policy instruments are provided in a factsheet in the Annexes. 3.1. Europe 2020 The European Commission published the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and urn, the inclusive growth in March 2010. The strategy aims to provide an answer to the recent economic downturn and should enhance the achievements of the Lisbon strategy. In addition to addressing the pressing needs resulting from the economic downt European Commission intends to reduce the gap in innovation and research between Europe and the USA and Japan. In order to achieve this goal, the Commission aims to speed up the process of forming the European single market in all relevant aspects. Against this background, the Europe 2020 strategy formulates key targets and forms a strategy that should serve the single market purpose most effectively. To this end, Europe 2020 defines three priorities (smart, sustainable and inclusive) that should cover all aspects of the European Union concerns. However, rather than solely providing new objectives and targets, the strategy reflects the understanding of the need to provide more integrated and coherent actions.

When comparing the Flagships, it is clear that all seven cover the targets related to employment and social inclusion. Five of the seven Flagship initiatives also address innovation-related targets. Each Flagship initiative is based on fact mirrors the different backgrounds of Flagship initiatives. While some (e.g. Innovation Union) have strong support from stakeholders in Europe, others lack this mostly economic support. Another distinction can be observed between the Flagship initiatives that have been extensively elaborated in the current and past programming period. Actions related to Innovation Union were launched at the beginning of the current 2007-2013 programming period or even earlier, such as the European Research Area in 2000. 15 Actions concerning human resource development were already covered by ESF measures in the previous 2000- 2006 programming period. 16 Nevertheless, the European Commission proposed the seven initiatives in order to improve the coordination between different-but-related actions in similar thematic fields and their effective fulfilment of the Europe 2020 targets. Each Flagship initiative describes a general aim and proposes sub-initiatives and actions to fulfil this aim. These actions relate to different levels of intervention. The first l the European Commission, where mainly strategic and policy-relevant actions are proposed, and the second level relates to Member States, where national strategies should be formulated and implemented and programmes developed. Thirdly, even though the Flagship initiatives address the regional and local level indirectly, it is the most important level for implementing actions and should support the fulfilment of the targets. Sub-initiatives relevant for the European level are, for example, the improvement of the internal market with legislative and regulative adjustments. Those European intervention include the improvement of standardisation and intellectual property rights, as well as the support of interactive and international exchange of experts in relevant fields. 17 Furthermore, the European Commission aims to create benchmarks for Member States on which basis activities at national level can be evaluated (e.g. research infrastructure, skills development, innovation support). Other initiatives deal directly with implementation at regional or local level (e.g. poverty, skills and jobs). Those sub-initiative (ERDF, ESF) but also by EIF-supported financial engineering instruments (e.g. Jessica, Jeremie, European Progress Microfinance Facility).

Innovation Union The aim of the flagship \u2018Innov challenges facing our society, ation Union\u2019 is to re-focus R&D and innovation policy on the such as climate change, energy and resource efficiency, ciencies: itiative should improve the European innovation re attractive for researchers and innovative people. To this end, the European Commission has proposed a set of initiatives that should help to lel Flagship initiative on \u2018New Skills and Jobs\u2019. The ecific activities are envisaged. One of the health and demographic change (European Commission, 2010). 18 This initiative was launched on the basis of Europe\u2019s deficit in research and innovation compared to the USA. The European Commission identified key defi \uf0b7 under-investment in research and innovation; \uf0b7 system component weakness; \uf0b7 system linkage weakness; and \uf0b7 system governance weakness. The Innovation Union Flagship in environment and make Europe mo support this aim at different levels. 19 \uf0b7 The first and most pressing theme for European competitiveness is the promotion of excellence in education and skills development . In this matter, Innovation Union works in combination with the paral European Commission intends to pool talents on one hand, while improving the human resource base with the appropriate mixture of skills on the other hand. This is accompanied by the need for improvement of public and private organisations facilitating knowledge and technology transfer. University performance must be improved with substantial support for research systems. Education systems together with regulations and financial systems should support innovative new start-ups and SMEs. A specific fundamental issue enabling research and innovation is the improvement of e-skills for innovation. The European Research Area should provide a platform for knowledge and technologies in which transnational synergies and complementarities are fully exploited. In order to actively support this platform, sp most important activities is to boost the mobility of researchers throughout Europe and from third countries. The main problem concerning mobility is the lack of available funding. This should be changed towards increasing brain circulation within Europe. Mobility could be improved by building a more coherent legal and administrative framework for research funding in Europe. The second step is to improve the research infrastructure in Europe in order to make it more compatible with, for example, the USA. This could be financed with several different funding instruments such as the Seventh Framework Programme, risk-sharing finance facilities or Structural Funds. Currently, research facilities in many Member States (particularly EU-12) lack state-of- 18 European Commission (2010), EUROPE 2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, Communication from the Commission, COM(2010) 2020 Brussels, 3.3.2010, p. 10. 19 European Commission (2010), COM(2010) 546, SEC(2010) 1161 final, Brussels, 6.10.2010. 34 ",

Progress in this respect has been initiated with the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) roadmap. Secondly, the Innovation Union initiative tries to generate EU funding from different programmes available. The initiative should combine and focus programmes relevant for research in the direction of the Europe 2020 targets.

The Flagship initiative paper directly names of improvements and generate synergies understands the need for high-growth SMEs to have access to specific financial support. Current programmes lack flexibility in supporting innovative entrepreneurs, but the Flagship initiative foresees the reinforcement of SME support in that matter. Together with the adjustment of regulations towards SME support simplification and the streamlining of procedures, this should help to improve the availability of funds for researchers. In order to integrate the Knowledge Triangle (education, research, business) at European level, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology has been launched to im accompanied by an improved policy framework. Thirdly, the European Commission is keen to move forward on market-oriented research. This includes an improved legal and standardisation framework as well as better access to finance for SMEs. Furthermore, should be made easier and more attractive for enterprises. The aim is to create a single innovative market with simulative regulations, standardisation, adjusted public procurement, knowledge management and protection and the combination of demand and supply-side measures. For this purpose, the Lead Market Initiative 20 has been launched, through which research and innovation should support the most pressing needs such as eco-innovation. \uf0b7 The forth initiative includes support for realising creative potential in innovation more broadly in the economy, improving knowledge flow and opening access to publications and data from publi The EC understands the need for spreading the benefits of innovation across the Union. The heterogeneity of innovative developments across Europe ERDF and ESF as the instruments to combat this development with specific activities in line with the above-mentioned action framework. This should all be supported and improved by pooling forces with European Innovation Partnerships. The partnership between the European Commission and Member States should help to speed up the implementation between Member States and institutions. However the Flagship initiative is still very strategic oriented and most of the sub-initiatives stay on that level. Only a few down to earth actions for implementation have been mentioned indirectly. The communication paper names the ERDF and ESF as the main instruments for implementation but does only partly imply what kind of actions are foreseen. In this respect it will be on the Member States to translate these rather general objectives into specific actions.

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 3.2.2. Digital Agenda The aim of the \u2018Digital Agenda\u2019 Flagship initiative is to deliver sustainable economic and social benefits from a Digital Single Market based on fast and ultra-fast internet and interoperable applications, with broadband access for all by 2013, access for all to much higher internet speeds (30 Mbps or above) by 2020, and 50% or more of European households subscribing to internet connections above 100 Mbps (European Commission, 2010). 21 The initiative has been launched on the basis that the digital market in Europe is rather fragmented and lacks interoperability. Furthermore, the European Commission has observed rising cybercrime and a low level of trust in networks. Compared to the USA, relevant research and innovation as well as digital literacy and skills are low. This Flagship comprises two main levels of action. 22 \uf0b7 The first level of action involves significant effort to build up and strengthen the legal and procedural framework at European and national levels. This should improve the current situation and support individuals, public authorities and enterprises, researchers and institutions with specific needs. To this end, the European Commission is proposing a set of actions that focus on the improvement of the single market by easing the cross-border interaction of business. Another effort at this level is the improvement of interoperability and standards . This focus goes hand-in-hand with the improvement of the digital single market. The main target is to improve the set of standards necessary for digital operability across Europe. Last but not least this level concentrates on the field of security . This will be addressed by launching a European Network and Information Security Agency, a European cybercrime platform and a European cybercrime centre. This should support a multi-stakeholder dialogue between experts in this field and enhance a joint undertaking in order to improve internet security at European level. When implemented, the actions described should form guidance for national actions . The European Commission is keen to improve digital aspects in Europe at all levels and in all Member States to support the single market. \uf0b7 The second level of action involves the improvement of infrastructure at all levels and in all Member States and the enhancement of digital literacy and skills. ICT access at all levels should contribute to social inclusion and combat poverty and unemployment. Several different actions are proposed at EU level: \uf02d reinforce and rationalise the funding of high-speed broadband through EU instruments (e.g. ERDF, EAFRD, TEN, CIP); \uf02d facilitate access to European Research Funds in the field of ICT for SMEs and young researchers; 21 European Commission (2010), A Digital Agenda for Europe , Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2010) 245 final/2, Brussels, 26.8.2010, p. 5. 22 European Commission (2010), COM(2010) 245 final/2, Brussels, 26.8.2010, p. 7. 37 ",

The European Commission requires Member States to implement the proposed framework conditions to generate improved single market conditions. Furthermore, the Commission asks Member States to use European Funds for the improvement of ICT infrastructure and ICT literacy and skills (see Table 3). Enhanced ICT access and usage should enable Member States to deploy ICT in several different aspects of society (e.g. environment, healthcare, culture and diversity, e- government, transport). Lastly, with the actions proposed in this Flagship initiative, the European Commission aims to improve international trade conditions.

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 3.2.3. Industrial Policy The main aim of the Flagship initiative on \u2018Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era\u2019 is to help the Member States to use their limited resources smartly in order to increase the global competitiveness of their industries (European Commission 2011). 23 Industry and especially SMEs have been hit hard by the economic crisis. This factor creates serious constraints not only on demand, but also on the provision of financial means, thus hampering recovery and growth. Additionally, global processes such as the challenges of globalisation and the adjustment of production processes and products to a low-carbon economy increase the level of difficulty. These challenges affect individual sectors differently \u2013 some will have to restructure, others will flourish. As a baseline, competitive enterprises of all sizes are needed. The EU identifies the following themes as requiring attention if significant progress is to be made towards the Europe 2020 goals: \uf0b7 Structural changes in the economy: Industries in individual Member States have followed a different path; some opted for higher-technology or higher-skills industries, others for low-end sectors. As a general rule, the former have suffered less from global competition. However, in each Member State there are competitive industries and growing firms. At the EU level, it is necessary to move towards innovative, knowledge- based sectors, decisive actions to facilitate change by improving product market regulation, supporting innovation, and investing in education and training throughout the lifecycle. \uf0b7 Innovativeness of industries : Research and innovation are prerequisites for productivity growth and industrial competitiveness. A modern intellectual property regime will protect the initial innovator without hampering further developments of existing ideas. The unitary EU patent currently being negotiated among Member States will significantly improve the framework. Innovativeness could be further enhanced by pooling scarce resources, by increasing cooperation in innovation to create large-scale test facilities (e.g. ESFRI) and by reducing the fragmentation of innovation support systems. \uf0b7 Sustainability and resource efficiency : Long-term competitiveness of European industries requires resource efficiency and low-carbon processes. In general, a decoupling of growth from material input can be identified in all Member States. Long- term incentives encourage material efficiency, promote innovation and facilitate the participation of SMEs in these processes. Furthermore, the EU must ensure fair pricing of energy and interconnected energy distribution networks. Another important element in the sense of social sustainability will be reinforced by the Social Business Initiative Communication and the Corporate Social Responsibility Communication. \uf0b7 Business environment : An open, efficient and competitive business environment is crucial for competitiveness and growth. This affects the administrative burden, time needed to start a business, complexity of legislation, taxation compliance burden etc. 23 European Commission (2011), Industrial Policy: Reinforcing competitiveness , Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2011) 642 final, {SEC(2011) 1187 final}{SEC(2011) 1188 final}, Brussels, 14.10.2011, p. 3. 39 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies Furthermore, high-quality infrastructure (energy, transport, and broadband) is required. Efforts should also consider initiatives such as unified service centres for the public, one-stop shops (so-called \u2018Points of Single Contact\u2019), shared networks, e-government and e-procurement and data centres. \uf0b7 Optimising the Single Market for services : Services are the largest part of the EU economy and their integration with manufacturing has grown as specialised services are used to manage the production and product-distribution processes. The importance of business-related services is growing as these services become integrated in the value chains of other industries by means of intermediate consumption, knowledge production and technology flows. However, standardisation remains a problem \u2013 intra-EU trade in services is still weak. The proposed Regulation on European Standardisation has extended European standards-setting to the services sector to reduce multiple and conflicting national standards. \uf0b7 Focus on small and medium-sized enterprises : Many SMEs still encounter a lack of demand because of time lags, but also because of difficulties in accessing finance and export markets. In response to these problems, Member States have adopted corrective measures such as increasing the capacity of loan guarantee schemes, investing in equity funds and microcredit programmes, credit mediators and finance providers for small businesses, including socially-oriented firms. \uf0b7 Taking into account that high-growth SMEs exhibit higher net job creation rates than larger enterprises, support them becomes imperative. It should also be noted that a large proportion of SMEs are unaware of support measures, and awareness and accessibility of public support could be further improved. Last but not least, average payment delays can be very long in some Member States, threatening the survival of small firms. The situation has worsened with regard to payments from public administrations. Table 4 shows the main activities proposed by the European Commission in order to achieve the FI targets. 40 ",

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 3.2.4. Resource-efficient Europe The aim of the Flagship initiative a resource-efficient Europe is to support the shift towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy that is efficient in the way it uses all resources, to decouple economic growth from resource and energy use, reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, enhance competitiveness and promote greater energy security. The Flagship initiative aims also to: \uf0b7 retain Europe\u2019s position as a first mover in green solutions, while meeting the challenge from global competitors; \uf0b7 achieve climate goals by reducing emissions; \uf0b7 fully exploit the potential of new technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration; \uf0b7 improve resource efficiency; \uf0b7 strengthen economies' resilience to climate risks, and capacity for disaster prevention and response; and \uf0b7 realise the job potential of renewable energy and energy-efficiency topics. Efforts towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy must fulfil three conditions: 24 1. resource efficiency is a horizontal issue requiring coordinated action in a wide range of policy areas and needs political visibility, demonstration and support; 2. initiatives are time-sensitive, and long investment lead-times require careful timing of interventions, even if some of them seem unattractive in the short term; and 3. any change must be carried by the consumers, who must be encouraged to move to resource-efficient consumption, generate innovation and avoid rebound effects annihilating any specific efficiency gains. Considering the complex and interlocking approach required, building a resource- technological improvements , decided for 2020 pave the way towards longer-term goals for 2050. efficient Europe can only be achieved with a policy mix that optimises synergies and addresses trade-offs between different stakeholders and policies. For example, a resource efficiency objective will create jobs in some sectors and eliminate jobs in other sectors; low-carbon technologies reduce fuel dependency and can improve public health; and waste reduction reduces pressure on land used for disposal. Resource efficiency requires and at the same time fosters a significant transition in energy, industrial, agricultural and transport systems, and changes in behaviour amongst producers and consumers. In order for businesses to follow this path, long-term certainty from the public sector is necessary. A long-term regulatory framework can provide stability and induce cost savings by reducing material and energy consumption and thus fostering future competitiveness. This Flagship initiative will help to build a strategic and integrated approach that will ensure that concrete actions already 24 European Commission (2011), A resource-efficient Europe \u2013 Flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 Strategy, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2011) 21, Brussels, 26.1.2011, p. 3. 42 ",

Considering these conditions, the Flagship initiative mainly addresses four groups of activities: \uf0b7 Exploiting synergies and addressing trade-offs , which requires an adequate policy mix. In reduction of vulnerability to oil shocks and energy prices volatility, benefits for public health through reduction of carbon use, balancing increases in resources taxation with reduction in labour taxation, innovation boost through recycling requirements, relief of pressure on land use etc. must be taken in account. At the same time, trade-offs such as loss of jobs in rigid energy-intensive industries, dependency on transport and fossil fuels for \u2018just-in-time\u2019 supply chains, rebound effects and lastly resource intensity of \u2018green solutions\u2019 should also be picked out, avoiding the propagation of a \u2018problem-free green future\u2019. \uf0b7 Defining components for delivering the Flagship initiative , specifically persuading stakeholders, i long-term stability and assurance. In that context, the launch of reliable and detailed roadmaps on the low-carbon economy, energy, transport etc. are the first steps towards establishing this long-term framework. In the medium term, relevant activities include an energy efficiency plan, the reform and alignment of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy, Cohesion Policy and the TEN networks (energy and transport), the definition of a EU biodiversity strategy 2020, the introduction and update of waste management, recycling and water efficiency in the policy cycle and public support for targeted R&D and innovation. Lastly, market measures are required both to achieve price and cost transparency and to tackle the challenge of the volatility of commodity markets and raw materials prices. \uf0b7 In order to broadly adopt policy decisions related to resource efficiency (and the subsequent pricing consequences ), apart from sh a robust and universal knowledge base is necessary, including common assumptions, parameters and baselines. As a first step, the Commission has developed modelling scenarios up to 2050 on climate, energy and transport policies. This first step must be supported by further work to monitor and evaluate policies, delivering impact assessment methodologies and fostering the global dialogue, e.g. via the Seventh Framework Programme for research. \uf0b7 The attention paid by the EU to governance and monitoring of progress goes hand in hand with the above elements. In the context of the Resource-efficient Europe Flagship, two roadmaps are fundamental, namely the Energy Roadmap 2050 25 European Commission (2011), Energy Roadmap 2050, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2011) 885/2, {SEC(2011) 1565}, {SEC(2011) 1566}, {SEC(2011) 1569}. 43 ",

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 4. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES INTEGRATED INTO COHESION POLICY KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The European Commission has finalised its first Common Strategic Framework that covers the three Structural Funds, the EAFRD and the EMFF . Partnership contracts should be negotiated between the Member States and the European Commission to replace the current National Strategic Reference Framework. \uf0b7 The new programme covers 11 thematic objectives that are linked to the Europe 2020 targets. With the use of a ring-fencing mechanism, Member States will be required to concentrate on their main topics rather than spread funding over various fields with a consequent inefficient use of funds. \uf0b7 The ring fencing concentrates on four thematic objectives : in more-developed regions, 80 percent must be allocated to RTDI, SME competitiveness and low- carbon economy (min. 20 percent of total); in less-developed regions, 50 percent must be allocated to the three objectives listed above. In ESF , 20 percent must be allocated to social inclusion. \uf0b7 Amongst the documents related to the thematic objectives, each uses a different terminology . While the CSF refers to key actions, ERDF, ESF and CF refer to investment priorities, and EARDF and EMFF refer to EU priorities. \uf0b7 Although the Cohesion Policy instruments relate to each Flagship initiative, the relevant documents of the instruments do not sufficiently mention the initiatives. The most direct references are made to Innovation Union and Digital Agenda within the ERDF and to Youth on the Move , New Skills and Jobs, and the Platform against Poverty within the ESF . \uf0b7 In terms of Cohesion Policy instruments, the most relevant funds for the realisation of the Flagship initiatives are ERDF and ESF . Whereas the ERDF covers considerable aspects of the Digital Agenda, Innovation Union and Industrial Policy Flagships, the role of the ERDF in relation to Resource-efficient Europe is less clear . \uf0b7 The ESF has a long tradition in skills development and social inclusion . However, the ESF is less important for Youth on the Move, which is covered by other non-Cohesion Policy instruments such as the Lifelong Learning Programme. \uf0b7 The Cohesion Fund has the least relevance for the FIs, while EAFRD and the EMFF contribute to innovation, improvement of ICT infrastructure, resource efficiency, support of SMEs and skills development.

Summary of legislative proposals for 2014-20 4.1.1. Strategic planning framework Following the Commission\u2019s proposals, the 2014-2020 programming period will entail a more coordinated approach across EU Funds and policies. The Europe 2020 strategy is translated into the Common Strategic Framework (CSF), which applies no Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF) and the Cohesion Fund but also to the EAFRD and the EMFF In each Member State, the Partnership Contract will then translate the CSF into a nation strategy, replacing the current National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). Similarly the national strategy will incorporate not only Cohesion Policy, but also rural developmen and maritime and fisheries policy. different funds; this will apply to the Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF) and the Cohesion Fund, but not to EAFRD and EMFF. Nevertheless, in multi-fund programmes each Priority wi receive funding from one fund only. As schematically shown in Table 9, the Partnership Contracts will be prepared by the Member States in dialogue with the European Commission and following the partnership principle, i.e. involving regions, local authorities and other stakeholders. Finally, on the basis of the Partnership Contract, it is proposed that national and regional authorities develop Operational Programmes (OPs), which continue to be the main managemen instrument, divided into priorities. There will be a stronger results-orien and measurable targets to contribute to national targets for Europe 2020. According to the proposals, this will entail more quantification, baseline values and the use of common indicators, amongst other features.

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 4.1.2. Thematic concentration A main aim of the new strategic framework is thematic concentration . It is proposed that the majority of funding will be concentrated on 11 Thematic Objectives linked to Europe 2020. In order to achieve this, a ring-fencing mechanism is proposed, requiring a minimum allocation to ESF programmes and some significant thematic concentration within ERDF and ESF programmes. To date, no ring-fencing has been proposed for the CF, EAFRD or EMFF. The requirements differ according to the status of a region, i.e. whether it is a more-developed region, a transition region or a less-developed region. 33 With regard to the um of 25 percent in less-developed regions, 40 percent in transition regions and 52 percent in more-developed rioritises Thematic Objective 9, Social inclusion , to and ESF, EU priorities for EAFRD and EMFF, and key in the CSF proposal.

ESF share of total Structural Funds, the Commission proposes a minim regions. Within the ring-fencing in ERDF and ESF programmes, there is a distinct prioritisation of four Thematic Objectives (see Table 10). In transition and more-developed regions, at least 80 percent of ERDF funds would have to be allocated to Thematic Objectives 1 (RTDI), 3 (SME competitiveness) and 4 (Low-carbon economy, min. 20 percent of total). The regulations also contain a requirement to allocate five percent to sustainable urban development, which would leave 15 percent to spend on other Thematic Objectives. There is more flexibility for less-developed regions, where only 50 percent needs to be spent on the three Thematic Objectives and the minimum for Thematic Objective 4, Low-carbon economy, goes down to 6 percent. With the 5 percent for urban development, 45 percent would be left for other Thematic Objectives. Ring-fencing in ESF programmes p which all regions must allocate a minimum of 20 percent. In addition, each programme needs to focus on four selected investment priorities from those suggested in the ESF regulation. The minimum allocation to them differs in less-developed regions (60 percent), transition regions (70 percent) and more-developed regions (80 percent). This would leave 20 percent flexibility in less-developed regions and 10 percent in transition regions. In more-developed regions, there would be no scope to allocate funding beyond Objective 9, Social inclusion, and the four chosen investment priorities. In a next step, the draft regulations develop the Thematic Objectives into so-called investment priorities for ERDF, CF actions priorities and the CSF\u2019s key actions, they mo ation to lusive growth.

LISBON STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION \u2013 LESSONS LEARNED KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The Lisbon strategy brought a thematic boost to Cohesion Policy Operational Programmes in 2007-2013. At least at the central level , the people involved were aware of the provisions of the strategy and were able to respond to it in their programming documents, although in some the codes of expenditure (Lisbon codes) were matched ex post to existing strategies. \uf0b7 The main Lisbon-relevant topics have been innovation, ICT, environmental resources, and skills development. Other topics such as poverty have been indirectly targeted. \uf0b7 Differences can be seen between federal and centralised Member States. While the former have a strong culture of LRA implementation, the latter have a more top-down decision process. Furthermore, soft projects have been more regionally or locally managed, and hard infrastructure projects have been more centrally managed. \uf0b7 The initial allocation of the budget to the respective Lisbon codes has been indicative, and it has not been monitored or evaluated. The Annual Implementation Reports did not reflect the Lisbon codes . \uf0b7 It is not possible to generalise about the best and most comprehensive form of project implementation. However, framework and \u2018 meta\u2019 projects concentrating on a better interaction between different stakeholders and projects have been shown to provide added value in social and educational fields . Business- related projects proved to be most successful when they were very close to the actors involved with only a few managerial levels in between. \uf0b7 The implementation process concerns not just the project level but the whole programme lifecycle . \uf0b7 The matching of Lisbon with national policies and the development of \u2018 ownership\u2019 at the MS and regional level remain as points of concern. For Member States in great need of hard infrastructure, the overall Lisbon process might have been regarded as a high-level intellectual exercise with little practical value. \uf0b7 For that reason, it is necessary to break down strategic and abstract concepts into \u2018down-to-earth\u2019 project ideas that can be comprehended and adopted at the local level. This chapter presents an illustration of the different levels of implementation of topics relevant to the Flagships in a group of Member States selected as the most representative for all 27 MS. The synthesis of case study results shows how the Lisbon strategy has been implemented, at which level, and where major success and drawbacks occurred. 69 ",

Whil ture investments in man research and environment, the latter concentrate more on the improvement of high-quality systems that already exist, so called \u2018soft\u2019 factors. The second major distinction can be drawn between Member States in central and peripheral locations. The basis for this distinction is access to resources and labou markets. The peripheral regions are characterised by low-de agriculture, weak accessibility and hence fewer opportunities to exploit the benefits of Lisbon strategy implementation. The third distinction includ devolution. Both are relevant for the scale, effectiveness and efficiency of strategy implementation. Taking into account the four different indexes, the following group of MS were defined: 45 \uf0b7 \u2018Advanced\u2019 with a hig Netherlands, Luxemburg, France and Germany; \uf0b7 \u2018Advanced\u2019 with a medium Europe 2020 performance: Austria, Belgium, UK, Slovenia Ireland, Estonia; \uf0b7 \u2018Less advanced\u2019 with a medium Europe 2020 performance: Cyprus, Spain, Portugal Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Italy; and \uf0b7 \u2018Less advanced\u2019 with a low Europe 2020 performance: Poland, Malta, Greece, Slovakia Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania.

The most important thematic impact was achieved in the topics related to innovation, knowledge and entrepreneurship. 51 However, the recent economic crisis modified this scheme, with Member States shifting their expenditure towards short-term targets rather than to long-term goals (see Case Study 1).

In the interview, the ESF Unit explained that the allocation of budget was made by priorities and areas or f investment in the programming phase, and the Lisbon- relevant codes were matched to these activities only afterwards. However, all Lisbon-relevant policy areas were part of the guiding instruments in the creation of the new ESF OP. The areas that were emphasised at the time of planning the HCI OP in 2006-2007, when Ireland had full employment, were as follows: \uf0b7 Disability/Equality/disadvantaged = 35 percent; \uf0b7 Education = 34.7 percent; \uf0b7 Training for employed and unemployed = 29.5 percent.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies Case Study 2: Innovation and Research in the Polish CP programmes CASE STUDY Innovation and Research in the Polish CP programmes In Poland, there are 21 Operational Programmes (OPs): five national programmes and 16 regional programmes. The central OP Innovative Economy has its entire thematic focus on RTDI, innovativeness and entrepreneurship. Each of the Regional OPs includes a priority that directly focuses on innovation (and generally on entrepreneurship). The Coordination and Implementation of Regional Programmes Department at the Ministry of Regional Development coordinates the 16 regional programmes. According to the Director, the activities realised in the areas of \u2018Research and technological development\u2019, \u2018Innovation and entrepreneurship\u2019, and \u2018Information society\u2019 as well as \u2018Education\u2019 within the ROPs, are concurrent with \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 aims. The Operational Programmes and their respective AIRs include reports on how the Lisbon goals have been implemented. In the AIR 2010 for the OP Innovative Economy, a sub-chapter was dedicated to reporting on how the Europe 2020 strategy goals have been implemented through the OP projects. The AIR 2010 reports that around 99 percent of the funds contracted under the programme finance projects that correspond to the Europe 2020 strategy goals, whereby: \uf0b7 96.5 percent of the value of the projects carried out corresponds to Smart Growth; \uf0b7 2.2 percent of the value of the projects carried out corresponds to Sustainable Growth; and \uf0b7 7 percent of the value of the projects carried out corresponds to Inclusive Growth. Case Study 3: Resource efficiency in Greece CASE STUDY Renewable energy resources in the Greek national reform programme The Lisbon strategy outlined the priorities and provided guidelines for reforms in accordance with country-specific problems and needs. In the context of the review of the Lisbon strategy, Greece presented the European Commission with a National Reform Programme (NRP) for Employment and Development, for the period 2005-2008, according to the Integrated Guidelines. National Energy policy as described in NRP report was largely based on actions for the completion of new energy networks and the development of the domestic energy market by enhancing private investment in renewable energy systems (RES ) and promoting energy efficiency for houses. However, recent developments in the economic background of the country prompted a redraft of the Greek National Reform Programme (NRP) for the years 2011-2014 under the Europe 2020 strategy in coherence with the \u2018Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece\u2019. The NRP represents the efforts of the government to implement a new growth model, on the basis of which the Greek economy will be able to achieve sustainable and balanced growth. In the context of the current NRP (2011-2014), the key priorities concerning the energy sector have been augmented with the substantial reduction of state shareholdings in the Public Power Corporation and in gas pipeline business. With regard to the field of \u2018sustainable economic development\u2019, energy continues to be one of the priority areas of strategic importance to the country. In 2010, the Greek Government adopted the National Renewable Energy Action Plan under the Scope of Directive 2009/28/EC, stating the legal, technical and regulatory regime to meet \u201820-20-20\u2019 obligations and the acceleration of the Greek economy through \u2018green\u2019 development and enhanced competitiveness of the private sector. The Action Plan is an overview of all policies and combinations of measures for energy efficiency as well as for the enhanced penetration of Renewable Energy Systems (RES) technologies in electricity production, heat supply and transport. All national and regional interventions in the energy and natural resources sector are implemented under the National Strategic Reference Framework 2007-2013 (NSRF) and specifically by the National Sectoral Operational Programmes. 76 ",

The ESF OP aims to build a more adaptable workforce that is open to learning the new skills needed to keep Sweden\u2019s high-technology industries at the forefront of world markets. In addition, the programme reaches out to those currently outside the labour market, such as the young and immigrants, and promotes the reintegration of people on sick leave, to bring them all into productive and fulfilling work. Two Priorities out of three (whereby the third Priority Axis is Technical Assistance) in the Swedish ESF OP address the major employment challenges identified for education: Priority 1 \u2018Skills supply\u2019 Priority 2 \u2018Increased labour supply\u2019. Furthermore, the ESF in Sweden has established five national theme groups whose role is to collect, analyse and systemise experiences from ESF projects in Sweden. The themes are: \uf0b7 workplace learning and adjustment; \uf0b7 youth; \uf0b7 integration in working life; \uf0b7 equality; and \uf0b7 entrepreneurship. With regard to target groups, there are variations between Priorities 1 and 2. Given the thematic orientation of Priority 2, the proportion of youth is larger in that priority. In Priority 1, the middle- aged are over-represented due to redundancies, and the highly educated are over-represented as well as companies (especially SMEs). 54 54 Swedish ESF Council (2010), p. 43. 77 ",

Reporting on how the budget allocations were performed is limited, but interviews have revealed that the process was rather arbitrary (see Case Study 7). Apart from those actors mainly occupied with the design of the NSRF and the respective Operational Programmes, the Lisbon agenda did not play any particular role in the implementation of Cohesion Policy instruments. Implementing bodies stated that they put more emphasis on thematic actions with which they already had experience , rather than projects with an innovative character.

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy Case Study 7: SK-AT Operational Programme CASE STUDY Programming of the SK-AT Operational Programme The programming of the Operational Programme started in autumn 2005. The process was based on the common experiences and co-operation structures from the 1995-1999 and 2000-2006 programming periods and took into account the challenges for the integrated development of the border region. According to the interviews with authorities of Austrian ETC programmes, the initial decisions on budgetary allocations by codes were taken in an arbitrary way. At the programming stage, the OP was first divided into priorities , then into measures . The thematic codes were allocated in groups by measures , and, in order to avoid duplication, the ETC programme managers avoided allocating thematic codes to more than one activity. The budgetary allocations by thematic codes are indicative, as they were based on estimates of the amount and size of projects foreseen to be implemented within a given activity field. These estimates were prepared by regional and/or local authorities involved in the programming phase, and the actual implementation usually only vaguely related to these preliminary allocations. In ETC programmes, the coverage of themes is generally wider than in national or regional programmes, which is why more codes are allocated under ETC programmes (see Annex IV). According to the ETC programme authorities, even though the AIR mentions the Lisbon strategy and its goals, there is no specific relation between actual expenditure and the original allocations to Lisbon-relevant codes , as the allocations in the programme are only indicative. However, interviewees stated that those dealing directly with applicants and project implementation have the least knowledge and interest concerning strategies and objectives. Instead, project support is focused primarily on available budgets and the needs and ideas of individuals/applicants. Many actors are strongly involved in forming project ideas to match programme targets to achieve the necessary budget expenditure. there was an imbalance between thematic fields, with an emphasis on road ast \uf0b7 environmental allocations were still not sufficient; \uf0b7 some Operational Programmes experienced ineffective targeting of interventions that required applicants to fulfil unrealistic targets (e.g. Czech OP); This observation has been confirmed by the respective IQ Network report revealed the following drawbacks in the earmarking process: 59 \uf0b7 infr ructure over rail infrastructure projects; \uf0b7 innovation and research as well as entrepreneurship themes had a strong emphasis, but with qualitative and quantitative disparities in different Member States; \uf0b7 due to the unspecific character of the thematic code \u201808 \u2013 other investments in firms\u2019, many Member States allocated the innovation and research budget to that code.

The economic cris ation and triggered ered by Structural Funds, is substantially affected Cohesion Policy implement several shifts within Operational Programmes. In Greece, there were six sectoral Operational Programmes and five regional Operational Programmes. 61 The strategic shift towards resource efficiency initiated by the Lisbon agenda indirectly had a significant impact on the Greek thematic focus. During the 2007-2013 programming period, national actions in the energy efficiency and energy for transport sectors are implemented under the sectoral Operational Programmes: OP Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship, OP Environment and Sustainable Development, and OP Accessibility Improvement (see Case Study 8). Only a small part of the energy-relevant topics is cov but that part experiences significant problems in implementation. Case Study 8: Energy policy in Greece CASE STUDY Greek energy policy The Lisbon strategy had a large impact on the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework. However, the earmarking process faced various obstacles at the beginning, because the MA needed to balance the expenditure among the key priorities, i.e. entrepreneurship, the 20-20-20 target and the development of large energy networks. In addition, a range of regulatory reforms was necessary at the outset in order to implement the strategy. More specifically, the problem was whether the investments for Renewable Energy Systems (RES) would be funded by Structural Funds or through a national investment support programme (the so-called Development Law). In view of the thematic orientation and negotiations, the Ministry of Economy decided to fund large investment schemes in RES not through Structural Funds but from national private investments initiatives. For the solar energy sector specifically, the Ministries agreed to exempt funding of photovoltaic from OPs, in order to allow for a high-offer contract (i.e. feed-in tariff). The goal of feed-in tariffs is to offer cost-based compensation to renewable energy producers, providing price certainty and long-term contracts that help finance renewable energy investments. In the recent economic and political circumstances that put Greece into prolonged recession, the implementation phase experienced significant delays . In addition, most of the energy projects, especially in RES, show a significant percentage of overbooking, meaning that the expenditure committed was not coherent with the market demand . Despite the fact that substantial expenditure had been contracted, the level of payments in 2009-2010 was very low because of the shortage in public finance . 60 Weak financial management performance, excessive demands caused by overlapping between the 2000-2006 compared to eight Objective 1 Regions. and 2007-2013 programming periods, new financial instruments, simplification proposals of the European Commission. 61 Five regions in transition and two phasing-in regions, 82 ",

The changes in th with their renewed emphasis on this theme, should accelerate both commitments and enditures. The thrust of orientation of the policy places emphasis on it (see Case Study 9). Case Study 9: Digital agenda in Italy CASE STUDY Digital agenda in Italy The national digital agenda recently acquired greater visibility and political relevance , and it is currently (February-March 2012) being reshaped . The institutional setting is changing: an inter-ministerial Working Group (Cabina di Regia) has been set up, coordinated by the Ministry for Economic Development and including the Ministry for Education, Universities and Research and the Ministry for Civil Service Reform. The Working Group is developing the policy around six priorities . Each priority has a separate working group coordinated by one or two Ministries: Infrastructure and Security (Ministry for Economic Development); E-Commerce ( onomic Development and Office of the Ministry for Ec President of the Council of Ministers); Open data (Ministry for Education, E-government and Universities, and Research and Ministr rm); Information Literacy (Ministry y for Civil Service Refo for Education, Universities, and Research and Ministry for Civil Service Reform); Research and Investments (Ministry for Education, Universities, and Research and Ministry for Economic Development); and Smart Communities (Ministry for Education, Universities, and Research and Ministry for Cohesion). According to one interviewee, \u2018it is not easy to talk about the digital agenda, because ITC is involved with everything \u2019. The policy includes infrastructure, development and the enforcement of rules for both the public and the private sector, and projects and applications in sectors such as education, e-government, health, social inclusion, risk prevention, and justice. The Cohesion Action Plan appears coherent with the priorities and goals of the European digital agenda. It aims at completing the infrastructure in order to develop (and allow the free development of) applications and services. The goals are: \uf0b7 100 percent broadband coverage \uf0b7 Ultra-wide band infrastructure \uf0b7 Data Centres The Cohesion Action Plan includes further activities that fall within the education priority but are relevant for the digital agenda.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 5.2.4. Involvement of regional and local levels Triggered by the Lisbon agenda, the current 2007-2013 programmes put strong emphasis on the regional and local levels. Thus the involvement of regional and local-level actors has been described as intensive in all programmes. However, there is a distinction between the involvement of LRAs in the programming phase and in the subsequent implementation phase . It depends on the Operational Programme approach (whether it is regional or national) and on the thematic fields. While social and human resource development is situated at the local level, more strategic, infrastructure and environmental topics have a top-down character. In general, in the programming phase the communication process included an invitation to cooperate in the elaboration of the NSRF as well as training and coaching on the Lisbon agenda. However, earmarking was deemed to be a preliminary bureaucratic exercise. Involvement in actual project generation and project management differs significantly between Member States and Operational Programmes. Programmes dealing with social and labour market issues in the ESF depend on local-level implementation. The ESF has a long history in this respect. With regard to projects dealing with social inclusion, a greater bottom-up approach is required to reach the right target groups (see Case Study 13). On the other hand, when it comes to skills and training, implementation can be managed either centrally or via regional public employment services (e.g. Austria AMS). However, not all Member States regard ESF as a bottom-up instrument. For example, regional administrations in Austria finance youth support through national support instruments rather than the ESF to ensure the necessary flexibility to react to short-term needs. In the field of \u2018 hard\u2019 transport infrastructure or environmental projects , the involvement of local and regional administrations is seen as counterproductive . The Greek example shows that, even though it was envisaged differently in legal terms, environmental projects are centrally managed . The general perception in this respect is that LRAs lack the necessary capacity and increase the bureaucratic process, so promoting an inefficient use of funds (see Case Study 10). Projects dealing with research and innovation are sometimes managed on a two- dimensional basis . In the case of Poland , there is a specific central Operational Programme that should support the national strategy, but due to the size of the country Poland has several regional programmes that also include innovation and research (see Case Study 11). However, the implementation and involvement of LRAs very much depends on the political structure of the Member State \u2013 whereas Greece has a more centralised structure, Italy is very much dominated by regional autonomy. In Italy, the Department for Economic Development and Social Cohesion (DPS), responsible for coordination of Cohesion Policies, involved all relevant actors at regional and national level (regions and ministries) and socio-economic partners in in-depth discussions on the achievements and problems of the previous programming period. Finally, the ETC programmes follow a different approach. Due to their cross-border character, the regional and local levels are consulted by the Joint Technical Secretariats (JTSs). Those Secretariats are mainly involved in dissemination and project generation, and it is their responsibility to involve local and regional bodies in all partner Member States (see Case Study 12). 84 ",
        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy The question of whether regional and local levels necessarily need to know about strategies, aims and the background to budget allocations cannot be fully answered. However, it can be assumed that those individuals who are directly involved with beneficiaries are sometimes confronted with politically delicate situations. In such instances, strategies and objectives should be presented at the local level in such a way that local actors can \u2018sell\u2019 the necessary aspects of the strategy \u2018message\u2019 directly to the community. Case Study 10: Top-down process in Greece CASE STUDY The top-down process in Greece The Lisbon strategy had a broad impact on drafting energy policy objectives , and stakeholders in the energy sector drew attention to fulfilling horizontal EU directives . The decision process was led by the Ministry of Economy and followed the open coordination method; however, the thematic orientation and earmarking procedure were based on the Ministry\u2019s guidelines, leaving little room for consultation . At regional level, Greek energy policy atial application of national energy is considered to be a sp guidelines. Energy policy planning and implementation is carried out and agreed mainly at central level. There is no specialised regional energy policy , and the only framework that sets the guidelines for the development and planning of RES installations at regional and local level is the Special Physical Planning Framework for the development of RES and land management (SPPF-RES). This framework indicates restrictions or specific requirements for RES applications that concern land use and also sets and maps out specific regions as priority zones for the development of RES projects. In the OP Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship , the Managing Authority of the OP is monitored by the Ministry of Development, Competitiveness and Maritime Policy. The Implementing bodies regarding energy-oriented programmes are the Ministry of Development (EFEPAE), the General Secretariat for Industry, the Monitory Authority for Energy and Natural Resources monitored by the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change (MEECC) and the Centre for Renewable Resources (CRES). Specific programmes are implemented at national and regional level by leveraging investments from private operators for energy efficiency in housing, focusing on energy saving by public bodies and by individuals and households. For energy efficiency projects in local authority buildings, the Centre for Renewable Energy Resources (CRES) acts as the Implementing Body. This national entity was chosen because of its know-how and rich experience, particularly in knowledge transfer. At the same time, CRES is coordinating the project for the Network of Municipalities funded by the EU Intelligent Energy Initiative. 85 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies Case S dy 11: The Polish interaction between cent tu ral and regional OPs CASE STUDY The Polish interaction between central and regional OPs With regard to the budget allocation, the decision on the earmarking process was made at national level. Following the decision to make greater use of the regional programmes, 25 percent of total allocation was given to regional OPs. The following stakeholders were involved in the programming process: the Ministry of Regional Development (as a coordination body and representing the Member State to the European Commission), regional authorities (mainly marshal offices, although all programmes were discussed in regions with all the regional participants: gminas, poviats, social partners, etc.), representatives from all relevant ministries (Infrastructure, Health, Environment, Labour and others) and social partners. Discussions took place at national level and with the European Commission (coordinator of regional OPs). The distribution of the allocation between the regions is based on the number of inhabitants , the level of unemployment and the GDP per capita (the methodology is the same as it was in 2000-2006 in the Integrated Regional Operational Programme). Poland aimed to designate 63.9 percent of funding made available within the \u2018Convergence\u2019 Objective of Cohesion Policy to implementing the Lisbon goals. To this end, average target expenditure thresholds were set out for particular NSRF instruments included in the categories used for the implementation of Lisbon tasks. Regional OPs allocated 40 percent of the total allocation to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy's objectives. The Polish system acknowledges the importance of regional bodies for the implementation of the regional OPs. Voivodships are very autonomous in their decision-making process. This structure will most probably be continued in the 2014-2020 financing period, and according to the Coordinator of the regional OPs, the most committed regional authorities are involved in the process of preparations for the new financing period (Interview Coordinator of regional OPs). Case Study 12: Involvement of regional and local stakeholders SK-AT OP CASE STUDY ETC Programme AT - SK The National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF, in Austria named STRAT.AT), was drafted through an intensive dialogue process that included all relevant partners at the Federal and the L\u00e4nder level. In accordance with the federal structure of regional policy in Austria, the platform for this process was provided by the Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (\u00d6sterreichische Raumordnungskonferenz). Similarly, the programme Slovakia-Austria was drafted by a Bilateral Working Group composed of national and regional authorities and relevant experts (see above). Throughout the whole programming phase, working group sessions identified common priorities for the development of the border region. By the end of 2007, 17 Bilateral Working Group meetings and 3 task forces had taken place. The programme has established Regional Bodies in each partner region of the programme. These Regional Bodies develop, implement and disseminate operations . The Joint Technical Secretariat (JTS) is regularly in contact with the Regional Bodies (via e-mail, telephone and face-to-face meetings). The Regional Bodies are familiar with the allocations by thematic codes , as they were involved in the programming phase and are responsible for providing an indicative number of projects to be carried out under particular activity fields. According to the interviewees, Slovak administrations and institutions are less experienced with Structural Funds, and this makes regular communication with the programme secretariat and management even more important. 86 ",

The priorities were decided upon by the ministry responsible for Cohesion Policy in cooperation with the Employment Ministry. The codes were analysed and chosen by a senior civil servant and the interviewee working together and presented as suggestions to the decision-makers. The budget allocation by priorities was decided at high level by the Secretary of State of the Employment Ministry. According to the interviewee, the allocation of budget to the codes followed a sophisticated process, and the advance budget allocation proved to be difficult in practice. (Interview with the National coordinator of the ESF in Sweden). A number of meetings, similar to hearings, were held in various geographical locations in Sweden. Local and regional stakeholders from various backgrounds were invited to present their points of view to the programme authorities and national authorities. The interviewee (Interview with the Coordinator of the ESF in Sweden) had open discussions with the social partners and anti- discrimination stakeholders in this working group. At national level, the labour market organisations, public authorities and other interested social partners are represented in the Monitoring Committee. Regional plans were drawn up by the Structural Funds partnership in consultation with the Managing Authority, based on the ESF OP. These plans, which require approval from the Monitoring Committee, aim to give the OP a sharper focus on regional conditions. According to the NSRF, for the national Structural Funds programme to succeed a productive dialogue with labour market organisations is essential in terms of both preparing programme proposals and programme implementation. 62 The programmes are conducted in partnership with various interest groups to secure a broad influence on the activities and scope to monitor and enhance the effects of the programmes. The dissemination of experience and information is also anticipated. In each of the eight regions, there is a partnership consisting of local actors and representatives of the labour market organisations (Interview with the Coordinator of the ESF in Sweden). 62 Swedish Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications (2006), A national strategy for regional competitiveness, entrepreneurship and employment 2007\u20132013 , Article number N7003, Governmental Publications, Sweden 2006. 87 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies Case Study 14: Territorial Employment Pacts in Austria CASE STUDY Territorial Employment Pacts in Austria The ESF in Austria involves regional and local authorities through so-called Territorial Employment Pacts (TEPs), which are also the subject of Priority 5 of the OP. The aim of the TEPs is to provide support for the implementation of employment targets through better coordination of the relevant actors at regional and local level. This is achieved through the establishment of broad regional or local partnerships that: \uf0b7 identify local problems; \uf0b7 utilise all available funding in an integrated strategy; \uf0b7 integrate and coordinate employment measures; and \uf0b7 implement measures for people furthest from the labour market. The Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection has supported cooperation between federal and provincial authorities in employment-related topics under the Territorial Employment Pacts. The objectives and tasks set in the 2000-2006 programming period are essentially unchanged. Each of the nine TEPs organised/structured at the level of the provincial states coordinates TEP activities and programmes with the relevant actors at regional and local levels . The Styrian TEP and the Employment and Qualification Pact in Upper Austria work closely with their own regional pact structures, which are linked to regional management structures. In Styria, there are currently six regional pacts, and in Upper Austria there are two regional managers that coordinate the Regional Pact\u2019s activities on employment policy, labour market and training at regional level. The TEP activities are also regionalised in Salzburg (Reko - regional pact coordination). In the regional pacts of the Viennese TEP (which are not comparable to those in Styria, Salzburg and Upper Austria), organisations work together in the form of district cooperation to strengthen the local labour markets within the districts. The results of evaluations carried out for th w the relevance and effectiveness of e previous period sho implementing the TEPs\u2019 structures, which is s were retained. The main message why these structure from the evaluations was the importa m the local level. nce of involving partners fro The national TEP network and the support of TEPs through the Austrian Coordination Unit have been identified as a success factor for implementation . The following measures are carried out under Priority 5, which deals with the support of TEPs: \uf0b7 Promotion of support structures and networks that help regional and local bodies to carry out analyses and define strategies, and with financial management, development of projects, monitoring and evaluation and/or in the implementation of the national/L\u00e4nder strategies at local level. \uf0b7 Networking between the TEPs and with the local, national and international levels. \uf0b7 Studies, monitoring and evaluation , and PR. In Priority 3b, TEPs develop specific measures for the integration of people who are excluded from the labour market. TEPs thereby aim to improve the employment situation at regional level. Regional managers can adapt the top-down measures of the Pact for Employment and qualification in Upper Austria to existing, operational and planned regional activities. However, it is more difficult to use the ESF in a bottom-up manner, which means that regional priorities and thematic fields can be related to TEP (or ESF) project forms to a limited extent only. As a consequence, it is difficult to establish compatibility between top-down programme measures and bottom-up ideas in an ESF context. 88 ",

Business interventions across borders are more sophisticated. Although there are several information platforms at European level, SMEs especially do not get involved in European platforms. In this respect, supportive regional platforms targeting cross-border exchange on a down-to-earth level are , as already stated, different thematic fields and budget allocations appropriately. While some Member States and thematic fields have a significant amount of budget available, and this can be used broadly to meet the Lisbon targets, other Cohesion Policy programmes have limited budgetary resources. Allocation to specific activities is more difficult and requires adjustment in line with national and regional funds. Many projects recommended as case studies by Managing Authorities are communication and knowledge-transfer platforms . Those projects concentrate on better interaction between different actors and projects . The main aim is to learn from each other and jointly form innovative new activities. In Sweden, for example, the ESF ha provide policy-makers with new and more appropriate tools for social and labour market interventions. In order to gain an overview and effective knowledge transfer, a so-called \u2018ESF meta project\u2019 has been launched to gather knowledge and experience (see Case Study 15). Most promising in this respect have been \u2018framework\u2019 projects, which work as an intermediary between the programme and individual pr characterised by a wider thematic spectrum, based at local or regional level, and are implemented by NGOs or other local-level organisations. Framework projects involve many different initiatives and provide a platform for learning and information exchange between different projects and activities. One example is the Irish \u2018Equal at work\u2019 project, which is led by the Dublin Employment Pact and aims open human resource projects. Many different initiatives grow out of projects with an innovative character (see Case Study 16). In many cases, projects for innovation and research are \u2018hard\u2019 projects funding a particular research process and the necessary equipment.

Case Study 15: Swedish ESF meta project A&O CASE STUDY ESF meta project A&O \u2013 Sweden 64 The ESF OP Managing Authority recommended an interview with \u2018A&O\u2019, the so-called \u2018ESF meta- project\u2019. In January 2009, the ESF decided to give more than \u20ac7.8 million to five national thematic groups to disseminate experience from the projects: the themes comprised (i) A&O (workplace- learning and adjustment), (ii) youth, (iii) integration in working life, (iv) equality, and (v) entrepreneurship. The first theme, A&O (workplace-learning), is a collaborative project run by Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, the University of Gothenburg, Link\u00f6ping University and the APeL R&D centre. The coordinators are based at LTU. A&O operates on regional, national and transnational levels. The A&O is compiling, analysing and sharing experience gained during the course of the projects to better understand the conditions for and benefits of workplace learning for the community, businesses and the individual. The objective is to promote the value of continuous workplace-learning to labour market parties such as employer organisations and policy-makers. The aim is to \u2018influence policy-makers, public authorities, trade unions, businesses and other interested parties to make decisions that support workplace-learning as a tool for meeting the changing demands on the labour market\u2019. 65 The A&O is developing a new Swedish model for competence maintenance and workplace-learning . A&O coordinates and evaluates the ESF projects. Based on the reports by the ESF projects, the coordinators choose the most interesting and effective projects and communicate their activities to policy-makers and public authorities to disseminate them to a broader public and apply the methods more widely. For instance, the A&O has evaluated the effectiveness of the higher allocation of funds to projects hit by redundancies from the economic crisis. The interview partner from A&O provided records and evidence including presentations that the A&O has held to issue policy recommendations on workplace-learning to the government, regional actors, and trade union and industry representatives based on the methods and activities reviewed (see also Annex IV). 64 Recommendations and selected projects are listed in Table 29 and Table 30 in Annex IV of this document.

Its theme is \u2018Increasing access to employment through open human resource (HR) practices\u2019. It has focused on reforming and developing HR policies and practice to create a more equal and accessible labour market . Projects are implemented by relevant stakeholders in the four main sectors: the health sector, the public local government sector, the private sector, and the very large community and voluntary sector. Over two rounds, this framework project under the EU Equal Initiative has involved over 50 partner organisations from the public, private and community sectors in Dublin. These have included four local authorities, seven area partnerships, various social partner organisations, seven hospitals and health service agencies, six major employers, 40 community and voluntary sector organisations, various training institutions, and representative organisations etc. (Interview with representative of Equal at work and project documents). The project targets employers, service producers, older people, people with disabilities, travellers, lone parents, women, ethnic minorities and refugees . The project carries out activation measures to facilitate or improve the access of disadvantaged people or people excluded from the labour market. Moreover, the Dublin Employment Pact is always up-to-date with relevant Social Inclusion / anti-poverty policies at EU level, which feed into their projects. The project representative interviewed for this case study maintains that the activities are designed in accordance with the national Employment Action Plan, the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon agenda. In addition, the Dublin Employment Pact makes recommendations to the national authorities, always informed by EU policies. Case Study 17: DUO**STARS Project CASE STUDY DUO**STARS Project The project focuses on e-procurement, qualification, capacity-building and administration. The general goal of the project is to strengthen cross-border industrial cooperation supporting the integration of firms and (semi-)public institutions in global knowledge-based high-technology networks. With a focus on high-technology industries (especially the automobile, aerospace and electronics industries) and human capital-centred initiatives, the regions strive to build on their strengths by capitalising on their skilled workforce and innovative capacities. Activities : E-procurement Folder, E-procurement Training, Virtual Lab, Dissemination Out Virtual Lab, Summer Academy, puts : E-Procurement folder, Seminars and presentations, Results: The E-procurement Initiative. The Virtual Lab resulted in at least three orders for delivery to companies, and these orders are currently being carried out. Smart Net is the follow-up project and cross-over project of the two above-mentioned projects. According to the JTS, this project will further develop the best elements of its predecessors, DUO**STARS and Innovmat. In fact, especially through the \u2018Virtual Lab\u2019 project (under the DUO**STARS E-procurement initiative), the cooperation between the DUO**STARS project and the Innovmat project was increased, furthering emphasising the need to build upon their cross-over characteristics. 91 ",

The programme offers citizens incentives to carry out the most important interventions, aimed at improving their houses\u2019 energy efficiency, while at the same time contributing to the achievement of Greece\u2019s energy and environmental targets ; once completed, the programme will help to make energy savings of up to 1 billion kWh annually . The combined application of the programme and the maturation of the legal framework (e.g. concerning Building Energy Performance Certificates) establish an integrated framework for the implementation of energy efficiency actions. The scope of the action is to finance interventions with two forms of funding (grants and loans). Furthermore, grants are available to support energy audits in the housing sector . The planning, management and implementation system of the programme is ensured by the cooperation of the following stakeholders: \uf0b7 The Management Authority for nal Programme \u2018Competitiveness and the Operatio Entrepreneurship\u2019 (EYD EPAE). \uf0b7 The Department for planni co-finances actions in the fields ng and coordination of the NSRF of Energy, Natural Resources and Climate Change. \uf0b7 Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development, (ETEAN) \u2013 \u2018Energy Efficiency in Household Buildings\u2019 Holding Fund.

The Operational Programme has financed 11,903 individual projects in schools in Calabria , Campania, Apulia , and Sicily . Projects include networks and connectivity , but mainly refer to laboratories and ICT classroom teaching equipment . They can be considered as a single project aiming at spreading ICT technology for all aspects of teaching in all schools in the Convergence Regions. The same school can have more than one project (e.g. language, physics, or science laboratories, network improvements, etc.). It is highly likely that all the schools in these regions have been covered by at least one project. The Ministry is the Managing Authority of this Operational Programme and of the ESF Competence for Development Operational Programme. It coordinates the implementation between the two programmes: it is now starting a project providing training in using ITC equipment to the personnel of the schools that have benefitted from the Learning Environments Operational Programmes. Individuals (endorsed by the school management) request the training if they feel they need it. Students are, of course, excluded, since (as the Ministry observes) most students are digital natives and learn how to utilise ITC equipment out of school.

This is why young people need additional counselling and supportive guidance facilities\u2019. 62 schools took part in the project in two Viennese districts (the 10th and the 22nd districts) between January 2010 and May 2011. Over 5,300 pupils received information, 84 thematic workshops were carried out, and 1,700 youngsters received counselling. 760 youngsters benefited from case management whereby they received individual structured counselling before graduating from school on making their professional or educational career choice and in the transition from school to job. VIA Produktionsschule: The goal is to support the integration of young disadvantaged women, and especially young women with a migrant background, into the labour market. Participants either enter a vocational training system (return to school) or take up a placement. Young women are encouraged to undertake creative activities and further develop their competence- based, social and intercultural skills. The project is based on the so-called \u2018Danish model\u2019 according to Kurt Hofer, the representative of the Produktionsschule VIA in Innsbruck. This model targets disadvantaged young people who have not completed vocational training, who are unemployed, or who have dropped out of education. The production schools give women the scope to explore the wide range of opportunities on the job market including \u2018atypical\u2019 technical jobs in woodwork, metalwork, textiles, etc. According to Kurt Hofer, most women still decide to take up \u2018classical\u2019 jobs (retail, administration, etc), but the project will continue showing young women the variety of opportunities available. 93 ",

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 6. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE - ROADMAPS KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The seven Flagship initiatives have been subjected to a universal roadmap grid, in each case defining and answering questions on who does what, at which level, when and how. Detailed illustrations have been drawn for each Flagship initiative. \uf0b7 Not all Flagship initiatives have comparable starting points . Some (e.g. \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 or \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019) have already developed a series of support documents and detailed roadmaps, while others (e.g. \u2018Youth on the move\u2019) remain more abstract. \uf0b7 There is no common approach to implementation . Specific Flagship initiatives foresee a lot of work at the EU level in the short term (e.g. \u2018Digital Agenda\u2019 and \u2018Industrial Policy\u2019), whereas others at the MS level envisage activities extending into the medium-to-long term (e.g. \u2018European Platform against Poverty\u2019). \uf0b7 The characterisation of an action as short, medium or long term is dependent on the Member State and its respective governance structures. Actions to be implemented in the short term in economically more-developed regions are often long-term issues in economically less-developed regions . \uf0b7 By contrast, a fairly universal pattern is identifiable amongst funds and policy instruments. While \u2018Horizon 2020\u2019 is more or less a universal instrument relevant to most Flagship initiatives, other instruments (e.g. EGF or \u2018Progress Microfinance\u2019) focus on specific activities. In the sphere of Cohesion Policy, there is a clear division of tasks , with ERDF covering the hard factors (i.e. physical infrastructure) and ESF the soft elements (i.e. human resources and skills). EAFR lement ERDF in their respective environments. Where D and EFF comp a plicable, the Cohes p ion Fund assumes responsibility for hard factors related mostly to the Flagship \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019. The results of Chapters 3 to 5 form the basis for preparing roadmaps for the Flagship initiatives. The first step before establishing the roadmap is to present an overview of what is to be done, how , when, at which level, and by whom . The Flagship Fact sheets in Chapter 3 provide the information on \u2018 What \u2019 is to be done. \u2018 How \u2019 is answered by the identification of the relevant policy instrument (based on Chapter 4) and by the attribution of an activity type to each item, namely: \uf0b7 Type A: Regulatory and conceptive actions: the relevant institutions issue regulations, suggestions and documents that allow the target groups to implement the activity flagship content, e.g. technology transfer centres or loans for innovative endeavours; \uf0b7 Type C: Promotion/award: the relevant bodies promote target groups implementing the activity related to the flagship content, e.g. by introducing awards for innovative local SMEs; related to the flagship content, e.g. changes in land-use plans for RES deployment; \uf0b7 Type B: Provision of infrastructure/funding: the relevant bodies provide the necessary infrastructure/funding for the target groups to implement the activity related to the 97 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies \uf0b7 Type D: Own implementation: the relevant institutions carry out their own implementation, e.g. municipalities introduce energy efficiency schemes for their buildings. \u2018 When \u2019 is answered by the division of the activities into three categories, namely: \uf0b7 Short term (i.e. within the current programming period); \uf0b7 Medium term (i.e. in the period 2014-2020); and \uf0b7 Long term (i.e. after 2020). In instances where a roadmap omits certain categories, e.g. no \u2018short-term\u2019 cell at the EU level, this means that the experts believe that no relevant activities are possible or reasonable at this level within this time horizon. At \u2018 Which level \u2019 and \u2018 By whom \u2019 are answered on the basis of the classification of the Flagship Lifecycle Matrices in Chapter 4 and on the MS grouping in Chapter 5, which \u2013 for simplification reasons \u2013 is reduced from four to two categories ( Cat. 1 : Member States dominated by transition and developed regions, i.e. groups 1 and 2 of chapter 5.1; and Cat. 2: Member States dominated by less-developed regions, i.e. groups 3 and 4 of chapter 5.1), thus better reflecting the conditions confronting the different Member States. This classification implicitly observes the difference in Cohesion Policy financial envelopes (i.e. less-developed regions are better funded) but also reflects the difference in devolution and administrative capacities. This distinction is not normative; rather, it should help all stakeholders involved understand the level at which interventions are necessary and reasonable. To this end, the envisaged roadmap is based on: \uf0b7 an assessment of the \u2018compatibility\u2019 of the Flagship initiatives with Cohesion Policy procedures and instruments; \uf0b7 an analysis of current practices in implementing the Lisbon strategy, which should provide a basis for the roadmap for future implementation procedures; and \uf0b7 the development of proposals for using Cohesion Policy instruments to implement the initiatives, efficiently incorporating the local and regional authorities. 98 ",

This is an indication that, in the short term, Member States must \u2018put things to work\u2019 rather than engage in conceptive endeavours. The same pattern is evident at the regional and local authorities\u2019 level. With regard to the medium term , the European level comprises a mix of possible activities, ranging from the establishment of a coherent legal and administrative system (Type A) to more concrete actions such as the empowerment of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and specific financial support for growth SMEs (mainly Type B, C and D actions). By contrast, Member States and regional and local authorities must initiate a mix of actions (mainly Type A and B or D) to operationalise the provisions of the new programming period and also provide the necessary tools. In the long term , the European level focuses on the enhancement of the European Re ar se ch Area, a clear long-term goal encompassing almost all types of action, whereas Memb er States and regional and local authorities will have to shift their attention to the ve ry practical issue of the improvement of the research infrastructure (i.e. type B and D activities, meaning investments, operation and maintenance). By zoo ming out , the path of actions for the Flagship Initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 becomes more evident. Whereas in the short term the focus at the European level is mainly on \u2018 shaping and norming the environment \u2019, at the levels of Member States and regional and local authoriti rming\u2019 . es the attention lies more on \u2018norming and perfo In the medium term, the roles change. At the European level, attention is given to incremental improvements while Member States and regional and local authorities must define the \u2018rules and tools\u2019 for their own territories. In the long term, the European level reassumes its \u2018 shaping and norming\u2019 role, whereas Member States and regional and local authorities continue to focus on making the system perform . Different stakeholders can draw different benefits from the roadmap. The European Commission and the European Parliament can focus on Type A and D actions over a medium-to-long term perspective (focusing on the new programming period), while local and regional authorities will probably be more interested in Type B and D activities over the short-to-medium-term timescale.

However, its limitations might include the concentration on fast-growing, inno growing. Opportunities in this respect are increased competitiveness in a globalised market (China, USA, Japan) and the increased attractiveness of Europe for international researchers. However, the initiative faces corresponding risks of the availability of public funds, barriers hindering administrative flexibility, and the heterogeneity of administrative and legal frameworks. When the foundation is established, financial support for innovative individuals and companies as well as the improvement of education should be assured in European regions. In this respect, two main European financial instruments are significant for realising and supportin Horizon 2020 (current FP7 and CIP) is one o \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 Flagship initiative.

Innovation Union could be an initiative to provide synergies between various policies and instruments at European and Member State level. Whereas a range of European instruments is involved in this thematic field (e.g. Framework Programme, Lifelong Learning, Erasmus, ERDF, ESF, etc), Member States also implement relevant national and regional policies and programmes. These different activities do not necessarily match each other, and therefore they can undermine efficient policy implementation. In this respect, the Flagship initiatives could serve as umbrellas for different and sometimes overlapping single activities . 102 ",

The aim and efforts of this Flagship initiative are more straightforward and focus mainly on infrastructure improvement and skills development . In both cases, considerable heterogeneity in quality levels can be found in European Member States . The combined improvement and homogeneity in infrastructure and knowledge, as well as in the legal framework, substantially serve territorial cohesion.

This Flagship initiative is two-pronged . On one hand, activities are concentrated at the EU and Member State levels on coordination and harmonisation of the education and Vocational Education and Training systems, the universal certification of skills and capabilities, the attractiveness of education centres and the mobility and employability of graduates. The operationalisation of the above should be supported by measures such as the \u2018Mobility Scoreboard\u2019 or the \u2018Youth on the Move card\u2019 to be established at EU level. In f the initiative can be expected to be high. On the other hand, at the Member State and mainly at LRA levels , the focus will be on nd on the governance structures and experience of this context, the level of success o the employment situation of young people through the introduction of practical tools in relation to Public Employment Services (which in some Member States are organised centrally and in others regionally) and in the support of graduates and young entrepreneurs (e.g. through the provision of infrastructure, legal support, subsidies etc.). In these instances, the success will depe each region and Member State. While European guidelines will help, the outcomes are expected to be much more variable. 71 As in Cat. 1, but with a respective time lag, i.e. improving young people's entry into the labour market moves to the long term. 116 ",

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 2020 and the FIs should be translated into action, especially at the regional level. Although urope 2020 and the FIs will ultimately feed into the 2014-20 programming period, there is irectly and explicitly referred to several Flagship initiatives. On the ther hand, criticism has been expressed that the Flagship initiatives contribute only to a mited extent to the goal of cohesion due to the Flagship initiatives\u2019 sectoral character. ome Cohesion Policy programme authorities are concerned about a weakening of the integrated territorial approach in favour of a national and sectoral approach to programmes. 75 Nevertheless, the FIs are designed to support the European single market that understands Europe as a whole rather than a sum of different national territories. The purpose of FIs is to set pathways to reach European targets. The criticism of their sectoral approach should be contrasted with the fact that the seven Flagship initiatives cover horizontal topics with relevance for many different sectors and all European regions . Cohesion Policy and any other European and even national policy would do well to consider these pathways. Hence, the Flagship initiatives should be integrated into coherent Operational Programmes. The current absence of the links leads to a low level of awareness amongst stakeholders in the Member States regarding the Flagships and a lack of interest in aligning their programmes with the initiatives. On the other hand, \u2018integration\u2019 should not become \u2018assimilation\u2019; implementation experience shows that Operational Programmes tend to favour so-called \u2018routine projects\u2019 instead of pioneering ideas for the sake of absorption, efficiency and the avoidance of irregularities. Considering the path-setter role of the Flagship initiatives, a symbiotic modus operandi must be sought. Lastly, the three Objectives of Cohesion Policy fare differently but are complementary to the Flagship initiatives. As demonstrated in the roadmaps in Convergence regions with large ERDF and Cohesion Fund envelopes, physical infrastructure investments are possible. In comparison, in Regional Competitiveness and Employment regions ERDF and mainly ESF can be used to enhance human resources and for specialised infrastructure . Considering the addressed time lag between countries dominated by Objective 1 and Objective 2, the orientation of the first two Cohesion Policy Objectives seems to fit well. Objective 3 European Territorial Cooperation can play a niche role as mediator and facilitator for the maturation and legitimisation of Flagship initiatives topics, thus assisting their broad uptake in the \u2018mainstream\u2019 programmes. E a widespread perception amongst programme authorities that the launch of Europe 2020 in 2010 happened at an inopportune time in the Cohesion Policy cycle. 74 At the strategic level , there are no conflicts between the objectives of the Flagship initiatives and Cohesion policy . However, when analysing coherence and correlation between the Flagship initiatives and the Structural Funds, relevant documents lack consistency . With the exception of \u2018Industrial Policy\u2019 and \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019, the Flagship initiatives in general refer to the Structural Funds, but the European Commission proposal for the new 2014-2020 programming period does not refer to Flagships in the same way. Either there is no reference at all, or the references differ to those in the Flagship communication papers.

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy Recommendation European level 1. Given the fact that those initiatives form a central part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the lack of adjustment and coordination between the CP and Europe 2020 has to be addressed. 2. All Flagship initiatives must be positioned in such a way that Member State representatives at all levels are aware of their existence . 3. Territorial Cohesion should be considered when designing Flagship imitative roadmaps and implementing Flagship initiatives. 4. Aligning Cohesion Policy with Europe 2020 requires not only allocating Cohesion Policy funding to Flagship initiatives, but also ensuring adequate framework conditions . The intervention logic of Cohesion Policy needs to focus on areas of structural and regulatory change, as well as capacity-building. The topics relevant for the different funds of the ERDF and ESF are in many ways highly relevant for realising the Flagship initiatives. Yet, the proposed thematic concentration and especially its ring-fencing mechanisms might limit the extent to which Cohesion Policy can contribute to FIs. Recommendation European level 5. The coherence between Flagships and ERDF and ESF has to be elaborated and defined in the general regulations of the Cohesion Policy instruments. 6. Indicators defined for Structural Fund evaluation need to reflect the objectives of the Flagships. 7. The duplication of processes and reporting obligations should be avoided and transparency ensured. 76 Member State level 8. When defining the operational programme, ring-fencing should be clearly in line with the pathways of the Flagship initiative. 9. Member States should take into account the objectives and goals of the Flagship initiatives when elaborating their partnership contracts. 10. Ta ing into account that Flagship imitative considerations in the partnership k co tracts and resulting Operational Programmes do not materialise into additional n fun nd of bonus, the introduction of incentives for the Member States ds or any other ki should be considered, so that Flagship imitative integration goes beyond lip service or simple monitoring of relevant intervention codes . Eventually, path-setting projects that refer to one of the Flagship initiatives should be empowered rather than, for example, \u2018standard projects of hard infrastructure\u2019. This is especially the case in EU- 12 Member States. ns (2010), p. 7. 76 Committee of the Regio 125 ",

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies Recommendation European level 11. Currently, European strategies are still perceived as detached and non-applicable . It is necessary to break down European strategies and concepts into understandable and applicable actions that can be adopted by local and regional levels. 12.

Due to the complexity and thematic breadth of the Flagship initiatives, a comprehensive monitoring of progress is recommended (e.g. in a form of a mind map around the Flagship initiative Communications, indicating preceding and subsequent documents). At present, this could be rudimentary, focusing on the generation of supporting documents , but later on it must become more sophisticated in capturing the new elements, i.e. revision of regulations, new strategies at EU level that will be developed because of the FI, etc. in the short-to-medium term. This monitoring could be structured either vertically along the topics of the Flagship initiatives (addressing visibility and comprehensiveness) or horizontally along the type of \u2018products\u2019 concerned (e.g. policies, regulations, structures, monitoring etc., addressing efficiency and coordination). 16. In a similar manner to Flagship initiative monitoring, the contribution of thematic input from working groups or committees could be envisaged. In that case, the vertical structure focused on topics is more manageable, creating dedicated working groups with the necessary expertise. 128 ",
        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy 7.4. Involvement of regional and local level The involvement of the regional and local level has been improved within the current period due to the introduction of the open-method coordination. Local and regional stakeholders have been involved in the programming phase; however, their involvement did not extend beyond this stage. Nevertheless, there are differences between Member States with a more centrally managed government and Member States with federal systems . While the former are traditionally top-down oriented in their decision-making process, the latter are used to involving regional and local actors. Many of the EU-12 lack this bottom-up approach and/or do not trust the capacity of the LRAs in implementing solving at regional level and argues that the regional and local authorities should be projects. Flagship initiatives are considered to be more oriented towards EU and Member State levels than towards regional level. The Committee of the Regions highlights the importance of Structural Funds for integrated problem- devolved approach of Cohesion Policy could provide suggestions for implementation at regional level. 80 It is the responsibility of the Member States to successfully support the involvement of LRAs in the implementation phase. As demonstrated in the roadmaps of the Flagship initiatives, there is plenty of scope for the engagement of the regional and local level. Wherever Type B and Type D actions are identified, concrete suggestions forwarded to the manageable and effective. Recommendation European level 17. Include concrete indicative suggestions for actions to the regional and local authorities in the supporting documents to the regulations. It can be assumed that most regional and local authorities do not have the capacity or the motivation for involvement in the higher-level strategy of the Flagship initiatives, especially considering that no extra funding is foreseen. Hence, the easier to follow and the closer to \u2018local level\u2019 the indicative suggestions are, the greater the uptake potential will be. Member State level 18. Enhance the development of territorial pacts amongst regional and local authorities in order to improve the implementation of partnership contracts. 19. LRAs are not sufficiently involved in European strategic implementation, and in many cases better and more comprehensive know-how transfer is necessary. Again, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure continuous transfer of know-how. 20. Include regional and local authorities in the programming and consultation process in ways that they can cope with and which generate meaningful responses. Present them with concrete indicative actions, and gain their approval or explore alternative opinions rather than engaging them in \u2018high policy\u2019 discourses or presenting them with given and non-negotiable scenarios. 21.

This includes an improved legal and standardisation framework as well as better access to finance for SMEs. Furthermore, cross-border business and innovation should be made easier and more attractive for enterprises. The aim is to create a single innovative market with simulative regulations, standardisation, adjusted public procurement, knowledge management and protection and the combination of demand- and supply-side measures. For this purpose, the Lead Market Initiative has been launched, through whi 83 ch research and innovation should support the most pressing needs such as eco-innovation. \uf0b7 The forth initiative includes support for realising creative potential in innovation more broadly in the economy, improving knowledge flow and opening access to publications and data from publicly-funded research. The EC understands the need for spreading the benefits of innovation across the Union. The heterogeneity of innovative developments across Europe leads to brain drain, \u2018innovation division\u2019 between regions, and social exclusion. The Flagship initiative paper directly names ERDF and ESF as the instruments to combat this development with specific activities in line with the above- mentioned action framework. Thi should all be supported and improved by pooling forces with European Innovation Partnerships. s The partnership between the European Commission and Member States should help to speed up the implementation of improvements and generate synergies between Member States and institutions. However the Flagship initiative is still very strategically oriented and most of the sub- initiatives stay on that level. Only a few down-to-earth actions for implementation have been mentioned indirectly. The communication paper names the ERDF and ESF as the main instruments for implementation but only partly implies the kind of actions foreseen.

        "How to integrate the EU Flagship initiatives into Cohesion Policy Background Industry and especially SMEs have been hit hard by the economic crisis. This factor creates serious constraints not only on demand, but also on the provision of financial means, thus hampering recovery and growth. Additionally, global processes such as the challenges of globalisation and the adjustment of production processes and products to a low-carbon economy increase the level of difficulty. These challenges affect individual sectors differently \u2013 some will have to restructure, others will flourish. As a baseline, competitive enterprises of all sizes are needed. Description The EU identifies the following themes as requiring attention if significant progress is to be made towards the Europe 2020 goals: \uf0b7 Structural changes in the economy: Industries in individual Member States have followed different paths; some opted for higher-technology or higher-skills industries, others for low-end sectors. As a general rule, the former have suffered less from global competition. However, in each Member State there are competitive industries and growing firms. At the EU level, it is necessary to move towards innovative, knowledge-based sectors, decisive actions to facilitate change by improving product market regulation , supporting innovation, and investing in education and training throughout the lifecycle. \uf0b7 Innovativeness of industries: Research and innovation are prerequisites for productivity growth and industrial competitiveness. A modern intellectual property regime will protect the initial innovator without hampering further developments of existing ideas. The unitary EU patent currently being negotiated among Member States will significantly improve the framework. Innovativeness could be further enhanced by pooling scarce resources , by increasing cooperation in innovation to create large-scale test facilities (e.g. the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) and by reducing the fragmentation of innovation support systems . \uf0b7 Sustainability and resource efficiency : Long-term competitiveness of European industries requires resource efficiency and low-carbon processes. In general, a decoupling of growth from material input can be identified in all Member States. Long-term incentives encourage material efficiency, promote innovation and facilitate the participation of SMEs in these processes. Furthermore, the EU must ensure fair pricing of energy and interconnected energy distribution networks. Another important element in the sense of social sustainability will be reinforced by the Social Business Initiative Communication and the Corporate Social Responsibility Communication. \uf0b7 Business environment : An open, efficient and competitive business environment is crucial for competitiveness and growth. This affects the administrative burden , time needed to start a business, complexity of legislation , taxation compliance burden etc. Furthermore, high- quality infrastructure (energy, transport, and broadband) is required. Efforts should also consider initiatives such as unified service centres for the public, one-stop shops (so-called \u2018Points of Single Contact\u2019), shared networks, e-government and e-procurement and data centres. \uf0b7 Optimising the Single Market for services : Services are the largest part of the EU economy and their integration with manufacturing has grown as specialised services are used to manage the production and product-distribution processes. The importance of business-related services is growing as these services become integrated in the value chains of other industries by means of intermediate consumption, knowledge production and technology flows. However, standardisation remains a problem \u2013 intra-EU trade in services is still weak. The proposed Regulation on European Standardisation has extended European standards-setting to the services sector to reduce multiple and conflicting national standards. \uf0b7 Focus on small and medium-sized enterprises : Many SMEs still encounter a lack of demand because of time lags, but also because of difficulties in accessing finance and export markets. In response to these problems, Member States have adopted corrective measures such as increasing the capacity of loan guarantee schemes, investing in equity funds and 141 ",

FP7, Horizon 2020 European Commission, knowledge base EEA, Member States Governance and monitoring All of the above FP7, Horizon 2020 European Commission, EEA, Member States Objectives The aim of the Flagship initiative is to support the shift towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon European economy that is efficient in the way it uses all resources, to decouple economic growth from resource and energy use, reduce CO 2 emissions, enhance competitiveness and promote greater energy security. The Flagship initiative also aims to: \uf0b7 retain Europe\u2019s position as a first mover in green solutions, while meeting the challenge from global competitors; \uf0b7 achieve climate goals by reducing emissions; \uf0b7 fully exploit the potential of new technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration; \uf0b7 improve resource efficiency; \uf0b7 strengthen economies' resilience to climate risks, and capacity for disaster prevention and response; and \uf0b7 realise the job potential of renewable energy and energy-efficiency topics. Background The consumption of natural resources that characterises our economy is considered a perquisite in the quest for quality of life. These resources include exhaustible fossil fuels, minerals and metals but also replenishable food, water, air and biomass in non-exhaustible but degradable space and ecosystems. The consumption and thus the demand for resources is accelerated by preferred lifestyles and by the global population growth, which is expected to reach nine billion by 2050, hence putting global resources under pressure and threatening the security of supply. Resource availability, competition for resources globally and consumption growth rates make clear that the status quo is not sustainable, and they will render resource efficiency key to securing growth and jobs for Europe. Hence it is necessary to find new products and services and find new ways to reduce inputs, minimise waste, improve management of resource stocks, change consumption patterns, optimise production processes, management and business methods, and improve logistics. Such an endeavour will stimulate technological innovation and in the medium term boost employment in the fast-developing 'green technology' sector and sustain EU trade by opening up new export markets and benefiting consumers through more sustainable products. 145 ",

This first step must be supported by further work t te o monitor and evalua policies, delivering impact assessment methodologies and fostering the global dialogue, e.g. via the Framework Programmes for research. \uf0b7 The attention paid by the EU to governance and monitoring of progress goes hand-in-hand with the above elements. In the context of the Resource-efficient Europe Flagship, two roadmaps are fundamental, namely the Energy Roadmap 2050 89 and the Roadmap to a Resource-efficient Europe. 90 Briefly, they foresee the following indicative activities. The Energy Roadmap \uf0b7 Considering energy demand: energy efficiency on new and existing buildings, new standards for consumer appliances, smart meters and transparency on energy consumption and pricing, provision of financing for consumers and businesses willing to invest in energy efficiency, and adapted urban and spatial planning. \uf0b7 Considering the switch to renewable energy systems (RES): market integration of RES, promotion of storage technologies, interconnection and smart grids, introduction of renewable heating and cooling. \uf0b7 Considering the future of fossil fuels and alternative sources of energy: fostering the use of gas as an important link in the transformation of the energy system, promoting unconventional gas sources, introducing carbon capture and storage, considering the role of (imported) oil and (locally available) coal in the future energy mix, considering nuclear energy as a decarbonisation option and developing alternative fuels, smart technologies and storage capacities. \uf0b7 Considering the energy market: introducing new ways of managing electricity (i.e. market integration, penetration of RES and ability to recover investment costs, access to markets, capacity and flexibility of the energy regulators in the Member States), integrating local resources and centralised systems, especially in the light of RES, and renewal of the transmission and distribution networks. In this context, the request for a unified approach to attracting investors is mentioned, especially regarding carbon pricing, market imperfections, the need to support early movers and the role of pubic financial institutions such as the EIB and the EBRD. \uf0b7 Lastly, the social dimension of the topic is underlined. For all these steps to be implemented, public support is necessary and informing consumers is paramount. Simultaneously, support for vulnerable groups must be demonstrated. The Roadmap to a Resource-efficient Europe \uf0b7 Setting up a framework for making and measuring progress: ensuring that stakeholders at all levels will be mobilised to ensure that policy, financing, investment, research and innovation are coherent and mutually reinforcing.

Description The initiative was launched on the basis that uture carriers of Europe\u2019s young people are the f prosperity, but they are currently experiencing obstacles in utilising education and training systems and especially in entering the labour market. Europe has fewer young people with a higher education degree than the USA or Japan and a relatively high drop-out rate. Member States\u2019 policies show different levels of effectiveness and often suffer from lack of coordination. \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 focuses on four main fields. 91 \uf0b7 Lifelong learning systems , developing key competences and quality learning outcomes, in line with labour market needs. The EU needs to extend learning opportunities for young people to integrate formal and non-formal educational activities. It should especially consider apprenticeship-type vocational training and high-quality traineeships as an entry to the labour market. \uf0b7 Attractive higher education , making institutions more attractive and open to the world, fostering innovation and keeping up with competitors in the knowledge-based economy. \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 will seek to improve the quality, attractiveness and responsiveness of higher education and promote more and better mobility and employability, while also increasing participation in higher education. \uf0b7 Support for learning mobility through programmes and initiatives being expanded and linked up with national and regional resources. All young people in Europe should have the possibility to spend a part of their educational pathway abroad, including via workplace-based training.

Secon to improve the national frameworks for job creation , matching jobs and skills development. In this respect, the focus is on monitoring the implementation and improvement of national frameworks and the support for know-how exchange. The four main aspects are flexicurity, skills upgrading and matching, quality of work and working conditions, and job creation. \uf0b7 Flexicurity will be supported mainly by shaping the legal framework at national and regional levels. Support will be provided through partnership activities aimed at the reform of national and regional frameworks. \uf0b7 Skills upgrading and matching, by contrast, is supported by several programmes and funds, the most important being the European Social Fund (ESF). Skills upgrading and matching of skills and jobs is one of the main instruments of the ESF. In addition to the ESF, two other programmes support the aim for better job integration and matching. The first is the \u2018European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals\u2019, which aims to integrate migrants into the employment process, and the second is the Lifelong Learning Programme, which consists of four sub-programmes dealing with school education, higher education and adult education in Europe. Further support can also be given in the fields of education infrastructure through ERDF programmes. \uf0b7 Quality of work and working conditions very much rely on the review and adaptation of European and especially national legislation. The thematic field covers a wide range of different factors such as health, non-discrimination, safety, fair payment, etc. The ESF can contribute in this field indirectly with supporting measures that reconcile work and private life, non-discrimination and equal opportunities. \uf0b7 Job creation mainly comprises support for self-employment and entrepreneurship .

Those most affected by poverty are people who have already lost their homes, who have no regular income, and who have slipped into indebtedness. Moreover, migrant population and ethnic minorities (e.g. Roma) are more exposed to social exclusion and poverty. 95 Description The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion Flagship should be seen as a horizontal instr ts that directly or indirectly help to tackle poverty.

Nevertheless, in times of lower European budgets and national economic crisis, there is a risk of Member States underachieving the jointly-set targets and failing to make the economic and social connection with the rest of Europe. In many cases, this goes hand in hand with inefficient and ineffective use of national and European instruments. 159 ",

A year later, similar projects were carried out by the City of Stockholm. The project combines language and competence development for employees in the area of care for older people and people with disabilities in the county of Stockholm. By the end of 2011, 600 people at more than 50 workplaces had participated in the projects. The target group was people whose first language was not Swedish. The idea of the project is that people who work in (health) care should be able to communicate to older people or their relatives whose first language might not be Swedish (language courses to staff and managers; language representatives for support in daily work, etc). The follow-up to this project is \u2018Arbetsam\u2019, which is however targeted at people whose mother tongue is Swedish (a total of 800 employees at 60 workplaces in municipalities, districts and private companies are involved, including managers). IF Metall IF Metall is the project leader of a series of projects in Central Norrland financed by the ESF to enable SMEs to develop both their organisation and the competence of their staff. Since 2009, 1386 people from different companies in Central Norrland have participated in a total of 42,000 training hours. The trigger was the fact that employees receive on average only half-an-hour of training in a year. In 2010, IF Metall then received a further SEK 13 million from the ESF to develop the competence of 1800 employees at 27 different companies within the project KYI (focused on strategic competence development). IF Metall also leads the competence development project in V\u00e4sterbotten and \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, which started in 2010 and is intended to run until November 2012. 100 A&O (n.a.), The Learning Workplace - The Swedish Way, A&O and Swedish ESF Council (2010), The Social in the Social Fund, Revised November 2010, p. 42.

The project\u2019s idea was to change the requirements and criteria that had been in force for working in geriatrics. The project aimed to make use of the knowledge and skills of employees in geriatric nursing. In order to do so, an individual curriculum was designed through interaction between the individual, the professional analyst and the manager. Most of the competence development occurs at the workplace with the support of supervisors. By the end of 2011, 6000 employees in geriatric nursing had been validated. A follow-up project for 2011-2013 incorporates lessons learnt from the challenges faced. Scania Due to the financial crisis, in autumn 2008, Scania chose to meet the decline in orders with competence development instead of redundancies. With the help of the county administrative board, they received SEK 120 million from ESF. Scania manufactures buses and lorries, operates in 100 countries and has a total of 35,000 employees. In the crisis, Scania employees signed a so-called crisis agreement, which meant that 60 percent of the members agreed to work 20 percent fewer hours for 10 percent less pay. The agreement operated during 2009. In addition, together with the county administrative board of Stockholm, Scania chose to apply for money from the ESF in order to offer employees competence development during the period of lower production. In May 2009, Scania received \u20ac11 million, the highest amount the Social Fund has ever awarded a project. Scania also invested several hundred million SEK by paying salaries during training. The aim was to improve the employees\u2019 positions in the 171 ",

The money enabled the 6,000 employees at Scania to receive further training in industrial engineering, Scania\u2019s production system, mathematics and languages. The trade unions operating within Scania were not part of the decision; instead it was decided by the management and the county administrative board. However, the union was positive about the decision. The training was conducted in the workplace at Scania. ",
