        "2 I S S U E 5 3 | F E B R U A R Y 2 0 1 5 Research and Innovation European Research Council President, Professor Bourguignon, travels to South Africa Prof. Bourguignon travelled to South Africa in January 2015 to raise awareness of the ERC and its funding opportunities amongst the South African research community. During the visit, Professor Bourguignon met the Minister of Science and Technology in South Africa, Minister Naledi Pandor and senior officials of the Department of Science and Technology (DST). He also met the President of the country\u2019s National Research Foundation (NRF), Dr. Albert van Jaarsveld and senior officials of the NRF. The ERC and the NRF are currently preparing a new cooperation programme which will provide funding for young South African researchers to undertake short-term visits to Europe with current ERC grant holders. On 13 January 2015, Professor Bourguignon spoke at a seminar to present partnership opportunities between South African and European researchers. This seminar was hosted by the South African Department of Science and Technology in collaboration with the National Research Foundation (NRF) and with the support of ESASTAP Plus (Strengthening Technology, Research and Innovation Cooperation between Europe and South Africa). ESASTAP Plus is a platform dedicated to supporting research and innovation cooperation between South Africa and the European Union and funded under the EU\u2019s seventh Framework Programme. ERC grants are very prestigious and provide funding for advanced as well as younger researchers in research institutions in Europe and its Associated Countries. According to ERC rules, grant-holders can work a significant amount of time per year outside Europe, which means that they can maintain an affiliation with their countries of origin. Based at the University of Bergen in Norway, Professor Christopher Henshilwood was awarded a \u20ac2.5 million ERC Advanced grant in 2009, and concurrently holds a South African Research Chair position at the University of the Witwatersrand. Professor Henshilwood is an archaeologist working on the early evolution of human behaviours among Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis in southern Africa and Europe respectively. .

Around 120 researchers, policy makers and business organisations attended. The Forum dedicated three sessions to international cooperation, namely on Arab-European cooperation, Arab-Japanese-cooperation, and Arab-US cooperation. The lively discussion on Horizon 2020 \u2013 following a presentation by Angela Liberatore on behalf of DG Research and Innovation - addressed the following: how to better involve young scientists (a strong \u2018target group\u2019 of the conference) and the private sector (still a low key actor in most Arab R&I), how to further facilitate VISA in relation to initiatives supported by the Framework Programme, and ethical and gender aspects. The issue of indicators for R&I was also addressed. The European Investment Bank contributed to this session. Another interesting issue discussed in a dedicated session of the Forum was the role of scientific diasporas in enhancing research and innovation in both home and host countries. Examples presented included Zeweil City \u2013 established by the Egyptian Nobel Laureate in Chemistry - and return grants schemes in some EU countries, schemes designed to counteract brain drain and facilitate brain circulation. This is a subject that could deserve further attention in international and, more specifically, EU-Arab countries cooperation.

The main goal of PACE-Net + is to strengthen cooperation in science, technology and innovation (STI) and to support the bi-regional policy dialogue between the EU and the Pacific countries and territories, and within the Pacific region. The Pacific is a long- term partner of the EU and is on the front line of major global challenges such as climate change and is a source of key natural resources. More than 80 policy-makers, officials and scientists participated in this event focusing on the development of a regional strategic framework on STI, and on its contribution to the global EU-Pacific partnership. The outcomes of 6 thematic Think Tanks that were held in 2014 in the fields of Health, Food Security, Climate Change & Natural Resources, were delivered and contributed to policy recommendations for science, development and innovation. Participants identified priority actions that will strengthen the EU-Pacific partnership, including the optimization of cooperation opportunities. The outcomes of this first platform will allow stakeholders to draw up the next steps to be implemented in order to develop a long term Pacific- EU institutionalized dialogue in STI. The future platforms in Brussels in June 2015 and in Fiji in 2016 will constitute two important milestones for this bi-regional dialogue.

It funded clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on phase II and III of clinical development. EDCTP1 also supported capacity building and networking in order to create an enabling environment for clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa in line with international standards of scientific, ethical and clinical conduct. The programme has been hugely successful. Under EDCTP1, a total of 254 projects were financially supported. The projects included 100 clinical trials: 30 on HIV/AIDS, 27 on tuberculosis (TB), 9 on HIV/TB co-infection and 34 on malaria. While 73 projects are still on-going, positive results have been achieved. A study of highly active antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding, for example, demonstrated a 43 percent reduction in HIV infections in infants and more than 50 percent reduction of mother-to-child transmission during breastfeeding. A malaria trial (4ABC) was conducted at 12 centres in seven sub-Saharan African countries. More than 10,000 children between 6 and 59 months old were screened, and a total of 4116 children were included in the study and treated. Three novel artemisinin- based combination drugs were found to be effective in treating children with a certain type of malaria. EDCTP1 has also provided 514 career and training awards to African scientists, including 56 career development and senior fellowships. Almost all senior fellows continued working in their respective countries after the expiration of the grant. More than 1300 research collaborators in Africa and almost 800 in Europe have cooperated so far in EDCTP-funded activities. Building on the success of EDCTP1 the scale and scope of EDCTP2 has been expanded. EDCTP2 involves a total budget of more than \u20ac1.3 billion, including \u20ac683 million from both the EU and the European EDCTP member countries, while additional co-funding is expected from third parties, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and pharmaceutical industries. EDCTP2 will also address neglected infectious and parasitic diseases, such as sleeping sickness, and the whole clinical development from phase I to IV. The EDCTP was created in 2003 as a European response to the global health crisis caused by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It currently unites 11 African and 13 European countries as full members who are represented equally in its governance. Mali, Burkina Faso, Sweden and Switzerland are about to join the EDCTP as well.

Policy News from the Delegations In the United States , President Obama\u2019s annual State of the Union address gave science, technology and innovation a significant place, stating that \u00ab21 st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development\u00bb. Separately, in a step towards the creation of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), Congress has passed the bipartisan Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act, allowing the top four manufacturing institutes to come together as a network and to create a long term governance structure. Also, a group of 122 companies, non-profit organisations, universities and research laboratories, led by the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, is partnering with the Department of Energy to launch a Manufacturing Innovation Institute for Advanced Composites. In his annual state-of-the-nation address, Russian President Putin announced a new \u00abNational Technology Initiative\u00bb, to bolster national security, develop new industries based on advanced technologies and for Russia to become a leader in producing high-tech goods and services. Technological breakthroughs are to be achieved by bringing together creative project teams and dynamic companies, leading universities and research institutes with the involvement of Russian researchers and entrepreneurs living abroad. Separately, the Russian Federal Space Agency Roscosmos has been merged with the United Rocket and Space Corporation (URSC) into a new state corporation, under the name of Roscosmos. It is hoped that the consolidation will bring greater efficiency into the Space sector. In India , Ashutosh Sharma has been appointed Secretary of the Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) for a 5 year period. The open access policy of DST and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has been approved, with specific guidelines for researchers and institutions, intended to result in easier access to results of DBT and DST funded projects. In addition, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has constituted a Council for Industry & Higher Education Collaboration (CIHEC) which will facilitate the development of strategies and innovative instruments of collaboration between Industry and Academia. In a cabinet reshuffle in Australia , changes to Prime Minister Abbott\u2019s government include the Minister for Industry, Ian Macfarlane now being called the Minister for Industry and Science, and the Department of Industry being renamed the Department of Industry and Science. A new Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 has been introduced in Parliament, which seeks to deregulate fees for the sector. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Research Council (ARC) have established a new initiative to increase research capacity in dementia as part of the Boosting Dementia Research Initiative, with a dementia research fellowships scheme. In China , the Chinese State Council has officially published the Agenda for the Reform of National S&T Programme Management, characterised by a rationalised structure with clearly defined objectives and the set-up of an open and more integrated management platform. Through pooling together the existing programmes managed by different ministries, the programming system will be restructured into five pillars: the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Major S&T special programmes; Key R&D programmes; Technology innovation instruments; and a special programme for infrastructure and talent. In addition, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has launched a pilot call with a deadline on 2 March to provide matching funds for CAS institutes that are participants to successful Horizon 2020 projects. At the African Union summit on 30 January in Addis Ababa, the decision was taken to host the rectorate of the Pan African University (PAU) in Cameroon and to appoint Tolly Mbwette (Tanzania) as its President and Paulo Hor\u00e1cio de Sequeira e Carvalho (Angola) as its Vice President. This follows the recent decision to establish the PAU\u2019s 5 th hub (Space Sciences) in South Africa. Separately, the 2 nd European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP2) has been launched in Cape Town.
