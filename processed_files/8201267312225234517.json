        "Bull. EU 6-2006 7 I \u2014 Brussels European Council Brussels, 15 and 16 June I.1. The European Council meeting, held in Brus- sels, was chaired by Mr Sch\u00fcssel, Austrian Chan- cellor and President of the Council, with Mr Bar- roso, President of the Commission, in attendance. Prior to the meeting, Mr Borrell, President of the European Parliament, addressed the participants and the customary exchange of views on the main agenda items took place. The question of the ratification of the Constitu- tion retained the attention of the European Coun- cil which adopted a timetable envisaging, in par- ticular, the deposit of a report based on detailed consultations with the Member States and on the possible future developments. The presentation of this report is planned for the end of June 2007. On enlargement, the European Council has not taken up again European Union absorption capac- ities and the perception of public opinion among the criteria to examine. The European Council called on the Commission and the Council to prepare a set of actions as regards energy policy, accompanied with a precise timetable, in order for it to adopt, at its meeting in spring 2007, an action plan defining priorities. In the matter of better lawmaking and reduction of administrative costs, the European Council notes that several Member States have already laid down aims of reduction of 25% and calls on the Commission to make proposals in this direc- tion between now and the beginning of 2007 for the European level. The full text of the Presidency conclusions and annexes is reproduced below ( \u2192 points I.2 to I.18). Presidency conclusions 1. The meeting was preceded by an expos\u00e9 by Mr Josep Borrell, President of the European Parlia- ment, followed by an exchange of views. I.

In June 2005 the Heads of State or Government called for a period of reflection during which a broad debate should take place in all Member States, involv- ing citizens, civil society, social partners, national par- liaments and political parties, with the contribution of European institutions. The European Council wel- comes the various initiatives taken in the Member States in the framework of national debates, as well as a series of events organised by the Austrian Presidency, in particular the Conference \u2018The Sound of Europe\u2019 in Salzburg on 27 and 28 January 2006. The European Council expresses its gratitude to the Commission for having contributed to the reflection period in the con- text of its Plan D and to the European Parliament for having organised, together with the Austrian Parlia- ment, the joint parliamentary meeting on the \u2018Future of Europe\u2019 on 8 and 9 May 2006. The European Council welcomes the intention of institutions and Member States to carry on their activities aimed at involving citizens in the debate about what Europe should stand for in the 21st century. It also welcomed the Commis- sion\u2019s contribution \u2018A citizen\u2019s agenda for Europe\u2019. 3. The European Council carried out a first assessment of the reflection period. This took place on the basis of the written report prepared by the Presidency and Council secretariat drawing on information provided by Member States on their national debates (doc. ",
        "Presidency conclusions 8 Bull. EU 6-2006 9701/1/06 REV 1), the \u2018Plan D\u2019 initiative and the White Paper on a European communication policy. While worries and concerns have been voiced during all public debates, citizens remain committed to the European project. Reinforced dialogue with the citi- zens requires adequate means and commitment. Citi- zens expect the Union to prove its added value by taking action in response to the challenges and oppor- tunities facing it: ensuring peace, prosperity and soli- darity; enhancing security; furthering sustainable development and promoting European values in a rap- idly globalising world. 4. The Union\u2019s commitment to becoming more demo- cratic, transparent and effective goes beyond the reflec- tion period. The European Council reaffirms its com- mitment to a Union that delivers the concrete results citizens expect, in order to strengthen confidence and trust, as set out in Part II. II.

In the meantime further efforts are required, partic- ularly as concerns: \u00a1 following the progress made on the Schengen infor- mation system (SIS II) and implementation of the Schengen acquis in the new Member States, rapid finalisation of the legislative measures on border con- trol and police cooperation and completion of the tech- nical preparations at EU and national levels, making operational the Schengen information system by April 2007 and the visa information system in 2007, thus paving the way for the enlargement of the Schengen area in 2007 provided all requirements to apply the Schengen acquis have been fulfilled, in accordance with the Hague programme; \u00a1 taking work forward rapidly on the Commission\u2019s proposal concerning the establishment of common application centres and the collection of biometrics for the purpose of visas and initiation of a pilot project, as well as taking work forward on a Community code of visas; \u00a1 taking work forward on visa facilitation and read- mission agreements based on the process and consid- erations laid down in the common approach on facili- tation starting with the countries with a European perspective as referred to in the European Council con- clusions of June 2003 and June 2005; \u00a1 further strengthening of practical cooperation in developing a common European asylum system, rapid progress on relevant proposals including the amend- ments to the European Refugee Fund as well as on regional protection programmes (Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Tanzania); \u00a1 achieving further progress on strengthening judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal law, finalisation in particular of negotiations on the procedural rights of accused persons in criminal proceedings and on the framework decisions on the European evidence war- rant, the application of the principle of mutual recog- nition to the enforcement of custodial sentences and the protection of personal data; \u00a1 intensifying police cooperation, in particular giving an increased role to Europol to support operations; \u00a1 pursuing the fight against trafficking in human beings, based on the EU action plan and fully utilising Eurojust, Europol and the task force of police chiefs. 7. The European Council welcomes the \u2018Vienna dec- laration on security partnership\u2019 agreed by Member States and neighbouring countries of the EU at the ministerial conference in Vienna on 4 and 5 May 2006, as well as the participation of the Russian Federation and the United States of America. It takes note of the first steps made towards such a partnership, e.g. improving cooperation between the EU and the west- ern Balkan countries to combat organised crime, cor- ruption, illegal migration and terrorism. The European Council takes note of the \u2018Vienna initiative\u2019 on possi- ble future tripartite cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs between the EU, the Russian Feder- ation and the United States of America and invites future Presidencies to consider how this initiative might be taken forward. The European Council calls for further swift implementation of the strategy for the external dimension of JHA, with a view to enhancing the coordination and coherence between JHA policies and external policies. 8. In the light of the increased cooperation and the need for further progress with third countries of origin and transit in migration issues in particular in the regions neighbouring the Union, namely the eastern, south- eastern and Mediterranean regions, the European Council recalls the importance of a balanced and com- prehensive approach. Developing the global approach to migration agreed in December 2005 is a fundamen- tal priority for the Union. Recent events reinforce this assessment. In this context the European Council looks forward to the forthcoming report by the Commission on the Hampton Court follow-up to migration and security to be presented at its December 2006 meet- ing. In the meantime the European Council: \u00a1 welcomes the concrete cooperation measures taken by the Commission, Frontex and some Member States in the wake of recent events in the Canary Islands and in the Mediterranean. It calls for enhanced efforts on maritime operational cooperation with a view to devel- oping adequate surveillance capacities at the sea bor- ders as well as on the establishment of rapid border intervention teams; \u00a1 underlines the priority of enhancing cooperation on migration with African and neighbouring countries and calls for a balanced dialogue on migration with African states, regional organisations and the African Union through a pan-African conference on migration and development; \u00a1 welcomes the Euro-African ministerial conference in Rabat, as well as other conferences with a specific regional focus, as steps to a regular comprehensive dia- logue with African countries as well as the launching of an EU\u2013ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) dia- logue on migration (on the basis of Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement); \u00a1 recalls the Barcelona action plan engagement to hold a Euromed ministerial meeting on migration man- agement and to highlight cooperation on migration as an important part of our neighbourhood policy; \u00a1 looks forward to the presentation by the Commis- sion of a communication on future priorities in the field of illegal immigration and follow-up action; \u00a1 calls on implementation of Aeneas funded projects on migration, providing financial and technical assis- tance to third countries in support of their efforts to ensure more effective management of all aspects of migration flows; \u00a1 recognises the importance of the forthcoming UN high-level dialogue on international migration and ",
        "Presidency conclusions 10 Bull. EU 6-2006 development and the need for an EU common position that integrates the development aspects of migration in a coherent manner; \u00a1 calls for discussions to be taken forward on the Commission\u2019s policy plan on legal migration. 9. The European Council calls for the implementation of the action plans agreed under the EU counterter- rorism strategy, including the strategy against radical- isation and recruitment, to be accelerated. Work must also be sped up on the protection of critical infra- structure. The European Council awaits the Commis- sion\u2019s first programme in this connection as well as concrete proposals on detection technologies. The Council and the Commission are also invited to develop measures to combat the misuse of the Internet for terrorist purposes while respecting fundamental rights and principles. 10. In the context of the review of the Hague pro- gramme, the European Council calls upon the incom- ing Finnish Presidency to explore, in close collaboration with the Commission, the possibilities of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of existing treaties. 11. Taking note of the progress achieved on the setting up of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the European Council calls for the necessary steps to be taken as soon as possible, so that the agency is up and running as from 1 January 2007. 12. Improving the Union\u2019s responsiveness to emer- gencies, crises and disasters inside and outside the Union remains a political imperative. When such emer- gencies occur, citizens rightly expect a swift and effec- tive response. While Member States are responsible for managing emergencies on their territory or assisting their citizens abroad, the European Union can, in a spirit of active solidarity, play a role by coordinating a political response and by helping to organise and coor- dinate available assets when requested to do so. 13. The European Council endorses the Presidency report on \u2018Reinforcing the Union\u2019s emergency and cri- sis response capacities\u2019 (doc. 10551/06) which sets out the many practical steps and decisions taken to improve coordination and delivery of available assets; to get assistance quickly where it is needed; and to pro- vide more effective consular protection to EU citizens in third countries. Furthermore, the European Council welcomes the report submitted by Michel Barnier in May 2006 as an important contribution to the debate. 14. Building on work carried out under the Austrian Presidency, particular attention must now be given to: \u00a1 further developing the European Union\u2019s rapid response capability based on means that Member States make available, including civil protection mod- ules, which should be identified and coordinated in order to make this response efficient and capable of ensuring a high level of protection for the European citizen; \u00a1 rapid implementation of agreed steps and decisions taken as set out in the Presidency report. These include the EU emergency and crisis coordination arrange- ments, which set up an ad hoc crisis steering group in Brussels and should be operational as of 1 July 2006, and the recommendations by the Secretary-General/ High Representative pertaining to the identification and coordination of Member States\u2019 military transport assets in support of disaster response; \u00a1 exercising these procedures and capabilities and learning lessons from these exercises and actual oper- ational experience to improve disaster response; \u00a1 working on the Commission\u2019s proposals on rein- forcing the Community\u2019s civil protection capabilities which were brought forward ambitiously during the Austrian Presidency. The Council should work for adoption of the necessary legal provisions by the end of the year; \u00a1 closer consular cooperation among EU Member States, including mutual consular assistance points in pre-identified regions. To this end, a joint report by the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Com- mission is requested in the second half of 2006. 15. The Council is invited to take work forward on the basis of the suggestions contained in the Presidency report, building on further input from the Commission and the Secretary-General/High Representative. The incoming Presidency will report to the December 2006 European Council on progress achieved across the board.

The European Council took stock of progress in several of the areas discussed at Hampton Court and at the last spring European Council, aimed at promot- ing the European way of life in the face of globalisa- tion and demographic trends. 17. Sustainable development means meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is a fundamental objective of the European Union. Sustainable development is about safeguarding the earth\u2019s capacity to support life in all its diversity. It is based on democracy, gender equality, solidarity, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights. While positive achievements have been made since the Gothenburg European Council, many challenges remain. The European Council therefore adopts an ambitious and comprehensive renewed EU strategy for sustainable development (doc. 10117/06). The imple- mentation of this strategy will be closely monitored and followed up by the European Council on a regular basis. 18. The European Council takes note of the Commis- sion\u2019s Green Paper on a future maritime policy for the Union and welcomes the launching of a broad debate with a view to the proposals the Commission is expected to present in autumn 2007. 19. Climate change is a global problem requiring global solutions. The European Council therefore looks forward to a successful continuation of the discussions in the framework of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and under the Kyoto Protocol to arrive at a timely post-2012 arrangement consistent with meeting the Council\u2019s objective of a maximum global temperature increase of 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The Council will therefore push in all relevant multilateral forums, including with all par- ties to the UNFCCC, for a full and open dialogue on future action and on agreeing an international goal. In addition, the European Council calls on the Commis- sion to submit without delay a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the experience of imple- menting the directive establishing a scheme for green- house gas emission allowance trading within the Com- munity, taking into consideration the situation of SMEs, and accompanied by proposals as appropriate. 20. The re-launched Lisbon strategy has already been refocused on those issues of most importance to the citizens, jobs and growth, in full coherence with the sustainable development strategy; special emphasis has been laid on investment in knowledge and innovation, business potential, especially of small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), and employment of priority categories. The European Council welcomes the Com- mission\u2019s and Member States\u2019 intention to pursue vig- orously the Lisbon strategy and ensure the good func- tioning of the economic and monetary union. In the year up to the first quarter of 2006, the number of per- sons employed in the EU rose by 1.8 million. ",
        "Presidency conclusions 12 Bull. EU 6-2006 21. The European Council in particular: \u00a1 welcomes the agreement reached in the Council on the services directive and calls for a swift conclusion of the legislative process; \u00a1 recalls the importance of a simple, transparent and easy-to-apply regulatory environment and of strength- ening consumer and business confidence in the inter- nal market; \u00a1 underlining the importance of the single market, welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention to launch a gen- eral review thereof, to be followed by concrete pro- posals for completing the internal market and ensur- ing its effective functioning; an interim report will be presented before the March 2007 European Council; \u00a1 stresses the importance of the social dimension of the Union\u2019s action. It welcomes the European Com- mission\u2019s intention to take stock of social realities in the EU and invites the Commission to issue an interim report before the European Council of March 2007; the Commission, the Council and the Parliament should pay due attention to the social impact of European leg- islation, including a gender perspective, as set out in the Pact for Gender Equality, within the integrated impact assessment; \u00a1 encourages the Commission to accelerate work on the initiatives outlined in its communication on indus- trial policy with a view to taking stock of progress in the first half of 2007; \u00a1 underlines the need for investment in knowledge and innovation, welcomes the final agreement on the competitiveness and innovation programme and calls for the rapid adoption of the seventh framework pro- gramme, as well as the EIB risk-sharing finance facil- ity to support innovation and R & D; \u00a1 calls for a follow-up to the Commission\u2019s commu- nication on the challenges ahead for universities and encourages the Member States to promote excellence and foster modernisation, restructuring and innovation in the higher education sector in order to unlock its potential and to underpin Europe\u2019s drive for more growth and jobs; \u00a1 reaffirms that the European Institute for Technology (EIT), working with existing national institutions, will be an important step to fill the existing gap between higher education, research and innovation, together with other actions that enhance networking and synergies between excellent research and innovation communities in Europe. It looks forward to receiving the Commission\u2019s formal proposal for its establishment, to be presented in autumn 2006, following consultation with the European Research Council, Member States and stakeholders; \u00a1 stresses the importance of addressing issues of direct concern to citizens such as food safety and con- sumer protection, and in this context welcomes the amended Commission proposal for a decision estab- lishing a programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy (2007\u201313); \u00a1 emphasises the added value of joining forces in combating rare diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa and MPS, with particular attention to children. It wel- comes research activities in the context of the seventh framework programme in view of developing preven- tive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and invites the Commission to support the efforts of Mem- ber States in this regard by making full use of the rel- evant EU instruments especially in the field of research and public health. 22. In its conclusions of March 2006 the European Council called for an energy policy for Europe and invited the Commission and the Council to prepare a set of actions with a clear timetable enabling it to adopt a prioritised action plan at its meeting in spring 2007. 23. The external aspects of energy security will con- stitute an important part of such an overall policy and will need to be included within the action plan. The European Council therefore welcomes the joint paper by the Commission and the High Representative, which is a sound basis for an external policy conducted in a spirit of solidarity and intended to ensure reliable, affordable and sustainable energy flows into the Union. It invites the Commission to take it into due account when it draws up the strategic review. It underlines the importance of using all the available policies and instruments to support external action in this area. 24. Meanwhile, since there is a continuing need for the EU to respond to the worldwide competition for access to increasingly scarce sources of energy, the European Council invites the Presidency, the Commission and the High Representative to take forward work on the development and implementation of an external energy policy in a coherent and coordinated manner, making use of all available instruments including CFSP and ESDP. This should include the development of strate- gic partnerships with the main producer, transit and consumer countries and concentrate initially on the fol- lowing priorities: \u00a1 conclude negotiations of the Energy Charter Tran- sit Protocol and secure the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty by all signatories to the charter; \u00a1 invite the Commission to set out elements for an agreement with Russia on energy within the framework of the successor to the partnership and cooperation agreement; \u00a1 extend the EU\u2019s internal market in energy to its neighbours (including the expansion of the Energy Community Treaty); \u00a1 make better use of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) mechanism to further the EU\u2019s energy policy objectives; enhanced dialogue with Algeria will be particularly relevant; \u00a1 give full support to infrastructure projects compat- ible with environmental considerations and aimed at ",
        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 6-2006 13 opening up new supply routes with a view to diversi- fying energy imports which would benefit all Member States; \u00a1 integrate the EU\u2019s energy objectives fully into its trade policy and pursue these through the WTO, as appropriate; \u00a1 attach particular importance to energy in the context of the Union\u2019s relations generally with major third- country partners. 25. The European Council underlines the need to fur- ther diversify sources of energy supply, promote devel- opment of renewable energies and make more efficient use of energy. It recalls in this context that it is for each Member State to choose its own energy mix. 26. The European Union will continue to actively pro- mote the dialogue between cultures and civilisations through all existing mechanisms, including the Barcelona process, the Anna Lindh Foundation and the Alliance of Civilisations. Particular emphasis will be given to the role that free media and civil society as well as their promotion can play in this regard. 27. The European Council welcomes the meeting with leading representatives of churches and religious com- munities organised by the Presidency and the Euro- pean Commission in Brussels on 30 May 2006. 28. The European Council welcomes the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement on the financial per- spectives 2007\u201313, providing the Union with the means to carry through its policies and stresses the importance of rapidly adopting the necessary legal instruments. 29. The European Council congratulates Slovenia on the convergence achieved since accession to the EU, based on sound economic and financial policies, and welcomes Slovenia\u2019s fulfilment of all the convergence criteria as set out in the Treaty. In this context, the European Council welcomes the Commission\u2019s pro- posal that Slovenia should adopt the euro on 1 January 2007. This first enlargement of the euro area to include one of the new Member States is a significant and extremely positive step forward in the Union\u2019s eco- nomic and monetary integration. 30. The European Council also commends Lithuania for the convergence it has achieved so far and expresses its support for the stability-oriented policies of the Lithuanian authorities. (c) Improving the efficiency, coherence and visibility of the Union\u2019s external policies Reference: Hampton Court informal meeting of Heads of State or Government: Bull. 10-2005, point 1.1.2 I.5. 31. The European Council welcomes the substan- tial progress made on the new external action instru- ments and encourages the institutions to reach swift agreement on the outstanding issues as soon as possi- ble in order to guarantee the delivery of assistance as of 1 January 2007. 32. The European Council welcomes the paper \u2018Europe in the World\u2019, presented by the President of the Com- mission and the internal measures being implemented by the Commission. The European Council invites the Presidency, the Council, the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Commission to examine the other measures contained in that paper as well as fur- ther measures, on the basis of the existing treaties, with a view to improving, among other things, strategic planning, coherence between the Union\u2019s various exter- nal policy instruments as well as cooperation between the EU institutions and between the latter and the Member States. The European Council thanks the Sec- retary-General/High Representative for his letter on follow up to the mandates resulting from the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in Hampton Court. In this regard the European Council reaffirms its full support for the role and the action of the Secretary- General/High Representative. 33. The European Council invites the Presidency, the Council, the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Commission to take work forward and agrees that a first stocktaking in relation to the implementa- tion of these measures will be made at the end of the Finnish Presidency. (d) Improving the functioning of the Union References: Commission communication \u2018Action plan \u201cSim- plifying and improving the regulatory environ- ment\u201d\u2019: COM(2002) 278; Bull. 6-2002, point 1.1.7 Commission communication on impact assess- ment: COM(2002) 276; Bull. 6-2002, point 1.1.8 Interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission: OJ C 321, 31.12.2003; Bull. 10- 2003, point 1.1.9 Commission communication \u2018Outcome of the screening of legislative proposals pending before the legislator\u2019: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 462; Bull. 9-2005, point 1.1.1 I.6. 34. The European Council agreed on a number of measures intended to enhance the functioning of the Union making full use of the possibilities offered by existing treaties. This includes opening up the work of the Council and bringing more clarity to the respective ",
        "Presidency conclusions 14 Bull. EU 6-2006 responsibilities of the various actors in the work of the Union. 35. Providing citizens with first-hand insight into EU activities is a prerequisite for increasing their trust and confidence in the European Union. The European Council therefore agrees to further open up the work of the Council and adopts an overall policy on trans- parency (Annex I). In particular, all Council delibera- tions under the co-decision procedure shall now be public. It requests the Council to take the measures necessary to ensure implementation of the new policy and to review their implementation in six months with a view to assessing their impact on the effectiveness of the Council\u2019s work. 36. In view of the importance of the principles of sub- sidiarity and proportionality, the European Council welcomes the initiative taken by the Austrian Presi- dency to hold a conference on subsidiarity in St. P\u00f6l- ten on 18 and 19 April 2006, as a follow-up to last year\u2019s conference in The Hague. The ideas developed at these conferences should be examined and future Presidencies are encouraged to carry this work forward. 37. The European Council notes the interdependence of the European and national legislative processes. It therefore welcomes the Commission\u2019s commitment to make all new proposals and consultation papers directly available to national parliaments, inviting them to react so as to improve the process of policy formu- lation. The Commission is asked to duly consider com- ments by national parliaments \u2014 in particular with regard to the subsidiarity and proportionality princi- ples. National parliaments are encouraged to strengthen cooperation within the framework of the Conference of European Affairs Committees (COSAC) when mon- itoring subsidiarity. 38. The European Council further recalls that the con- fidence of citizens in the European project can benefit from European legislation reflecting more strongly the added value of EU action. It therefore invites the Coun- cil, the European Parliament and the European Com- mission to consistently check the correct application of the principles and guidelines laid down in the pro- tocol on subsidiarity and proportionality. 39. The European Council equally welcomes the pos- itive outcome of discussions between the European Par- liament, the Council and the Commission on the comi- tology reform, which will provide for a horizontal and satisfying solution. The newly agreed provisions will enhance scrutiny by the legislator with regard to the Commission\u2019s implementing powers in areas subject to co-decision, thus improving the comitology procedures. 40. Progress has been made since its last meeting in all fields of better regulation and all institutions and Mem- ber States are urged to implement their respective com- mitments as set out in the 2003 interinstitutional agree- ment on better lawmaking. The European Council calls on the Member States to take initiatives at national level, including through their national reform pro- grammes, in order to reduce administrative burdens on enterprises. It invites the Commission to report on the progress made at national and Community levels by early 2007. The spring European Council should draw conclusions on further steps to be taken. Priority should be given to reducing unnecessary administra- tive burdens, which pose a significant barrier to a more innovative and knowledge-intensive economy and are particularly detrimental to SMEs. Noting that some Member States have already set targets for reducing administrative burdens by 25%, the European Council is convinced that it should be possible to set similar targets at EU level and invites the Commission to make appropriate proposals by early 2007 in time for the spring European Council. 41. The European Council welcomes: \u00a1 the further embedding of the use of global inte- grated impact assessments in decision-making in the work of all institutions as a crucial element in the pol- icymaking process; \u00a1 the implementation of the Commission\u2019s pro- gramme to simplify existing legislation. It looks for- ward to receiving a Commission report on implemen- tation in the second half of 2006 and requests that relevant Council formations give priority to specific simplification proposals. It also stresses the importance of extending the simplification programme to all rele- vant branches of the European economy, while respect- ing the acquis communautaire ; \u00a1 the successful conclusion of the Commission\u2019s 2005 screening exercise and invites the Commission to con- tinue to screen pending proposals. III. Looking to the future (a) Pursuing reform: the Constitution References: Declaration by the Heads of State or Govern- ment of the Member States of the European Union on the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Con- stitution for Europe (European Council, 16 and 17 June 2005): Bull. 6-2005, point I.30 Commission communication \u2018The Commission\u2019s contribution to the period of reflection and beyond: Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate\u2019: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 494; Bull. 10-2005, point 1.1.3 I.7. 42. At the meeting of the European Council on 16/17 June 2005, Heads of State and Government agreed to come back to the issue of the ratification of the Constitution in the first half of 2006 in order to make an overall assessment of the national debates ",
        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 6-2006 15 launched as part of the period of reflection and to agree on how to proceed. 43. Since last June a further five Member States have ratified the Constitution, bringing the total number of ratifications to 15. Two Member States have been unable to ratify, and eight have still to complete the ratification process, one of which has recently launched the procedure to that effect. It is hoped that this process will be completed in line with the conclu- sions of June 2005. 44. Recalling its conclusions of June 2005, the European Council welcomes the various initiatives taken within the framework of the national debates as well as the contri- butions of the Commission and Parliament to the reflec- tion period. The significant efforts made to increase and expand the dialogue with Europe\u2019s citizens, including the Commission\u2019s \u2018Plan D\u2019 initiative, should be continued. 45. The reflection period has overall been useful in enabling the Union to assess the concerns and worries expressed in the course of the ratification process. It considers that, in parallel with the ongoing ratifica- tion process, further work, building on what has been achieved since last June, is needed before decisions on the future of the Constitution can be taken. 46. After last year\u2019s period of reflection, work should now focus on delivery of concrete results and imple- mentation of projects. The European Council agrees a two-track approach. On the one hand, best use should be made of the possibilities offered by the existing treaties in order to deliver the concrete results that citizens expect. 47. On the other hand, the Presidency will present a report to the European Council during the first semes- ter of 2007, based on extensive consultations with the Member States. This report should contain an assess- ment of the state of discussion with regard to the Con- stitution and explore possible future developments. 48. The report will subsequently be examined by the European Council. The outcome of this examination will serve as the basis for further decisions on how to continue the reform process, it being understood that the necessary steps to that effect will have been taken during the sec- ond semester of 2008 at the latest. Each Presidency in office since the start of the reflection period has a partic- ular responsibility to ensure the continuity of this process. 49. The European Council calls for the adoption, on 25 March 2007 in Berlin, of a political declaration by EU leaders, setting out Europe\u2019s values and ambitions and confirming their shared commitment to deliver them, commemorating 50 years of the Treaties of Rome.

The European Council takes note of the initial discussions on enlargement held at the informal for- eign ministers\u2019 meeting in Salzburg on 11 March and in Klosterneuburg on 27 and 28 May 2006. It agreed to continue and deepen this general discussion during the second half of 2006. 51. Enlargement has proved a historic opportunity to ensure peace, security, stability, democracy, the rule of law as well as growth and prosperity in the European Union as a whole. Enlargement is equally helping the EU to become a more competitive and dynamic econ- omy and be better prepared to meet the challenges of a globalised and changing world. The European Coun- cil welcomes in this context the Commission\u2019s report on the economic success of the Union\u2019s historic fifth enlargement, of which the accession of Bulgaria and Romania is an integral part. Bulgaria and Romania 52. It is the Union\u2019s common objective to welcome Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007 as members of the Union if they are ready. On the basis of the Com- mission\u2019s monitoring report of May 2006 the European Council confirms this position. While commending both countries for the reform efforts undertaken lately, ",
        "Presidency conclusions 16 Bull. EU 6-2006 the European Council calls on Bulgaria and Romania to rigorously step up their efforts to tackle decisively and without delay the remaining issues of concern as mentioned in the commission\u2019s May 2006 report. The European Council remains convinced that, with the necessary political will, both countries can overcome the deficits stated to reach the envisaged date of acces- sion on 1 January 2007. It therefore welcomes the intention of the Commission to present its next moni- toring reports by early October at the latest. It encour- ages Member States to complete the ratification of the Accession Treaty on time. General questions of future enlargement 53. The European Council reaffirmed that it will hon- our existing commitments and emphasised that every effort should be made to protect the cohesion and the effectiveness of the Union. It will be important to ensure in future that the Union is able to function polit- ically, financially and institutionally as it enlarges, and to further deepen Europe\u2019s common project. Therefore the European Council will, at its meeting in December 2006, have a debate on all aspects of further enlarge- ments, including the Union\u2019s capacity to absorb new members and further ways of improving the quality of the enlargement process on the basis of the positive experiences accumulated so far. It recalls in this con- nection that the pace of enlargement must take the Union\u2019s absorption capacity into account. The Com- mission is invited to provide a special report on all rel- evant aspects pertaining to the Union\u2019s absorption capacity, at the same time as it presents its annual progress reports on enlargement and the pre-accession process. This specific analysis should also cover the issue of present and future perception of enlargement by citizens and should take into account the need to explain the enlargement process adequately to the pub- lic within the Union. Turkey 54. The European Council reviewed progress made in the acquis screening and welcomes the start of sub- stantive accession negotiations with Turkey. Turkey is expected to share the values, objectives and the legal order set out in the treaties. The Union is committed to support Turkey in its efforts to comply with the Union\u2019s standards and membership obligations, includ- ing the Copenhagen criteria. The European Council recalls, in line with previous conclusions, that the cur- rent negotiations are based on each country\u2019s own mer- its and that their pace will depend on each country\u2019s progress in preparing for accession measured against the requirements set out in the negotiating framework. This includes the fulfilment of Turkey\u2019s obligations under the association agreement and under its addi- tional protocol, full implementation of which will be evaluated in 2006 as agreed in the declaration of the European Community and its Member States of 21 September 2005, as well as the implementation of the revised accession partnership. The European Coun- cil recalls that the Council will ensure, in the course of 2006, a follow-up on the progress made on all the rel- evant issues included in the aforementioned declara- tion. The European Council calls on Turkey to inten- sify the reform process and to implement it fully and effectively, so as to ensure its irreversibility and sus- tainability as well as to progress towards the complete fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria, includ- ing the commitment to good neighbourly relations. In this context, any action which could negatively affect the process of peaceful settlement of disputes should be avoided. Croatia 55. The European Council reviewed progress made in the acquis screening and welcomes the start of sub- stantive accession negotiations with Croatia. Croatia is expected to share the values, objectives and the legal order set out in the treaties. The Union is committed to support Croatia in its efforts to comply with the Union\u2019s standards and membership obligations, including the Copenhagen criteria and good neighbourly relations. The European Council recalls, in line with previous con- clusions, that the current negotiations are based on each country\u2019s own merits and that their pace will depend on each country\u2019s progress in preparing for accession measured against the requirements set out in the nego- tiating framework. This includes the fulfilment of obli- gations under the stabilisation and association agree- ment as well as the implementation of the accession partnership. The European Council encourages Croatia to continue its reform efforts and to achieve sustainable progress towards the fulfilment of EU standards.

        "Annexes to the Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 6-2006 17 I.9. 56. The European Council reconfirmed the Euro- pean perspective of the western Balkans as set out in the stabilisation and association process, the Thessa- loniki agenda and the Salzburg declaration of March 2006. In this respect, the European Council confirmed that the future of the western Balkans lies in the Euro- pean Union. Each country\u2019s progress towards the Euro- pean Union will continue to depend on individual mer- its in meeting the conditions and requirements set forth in the Copenhagen criteria and in the stabilisation and association process, including full cooperation with the ICTY and maintaining good neighbourly relations. All western Balkan countries have in the last year made significant steps along their road towards the EU, with EU membership as ultimate goal in conformity with the Thessaloniki agenda. The Council welcomed the initial progress made in the implementation of the Commission\u2019s communication \u2018The western Balkans on the road to the EU: consolidating stability and rais- ing prosperity\u2019. The European Union will continue assisting the western Balkan countries through practi- cal measures to make the European perspective more tangible and is looking forward to concrete results in the near future notably in areas such as regional free trade and visa facilitation in line with the common approach. The European Council welcomes the inten- tion of the Commission to extend and to intensify its cooperation with the European Investment Bank and other international financial institutions in the western Balkans with a view to taking appropriate measures aiming at a finance facility for the western Balkans. External relations I.10. 57. The European Council reiterates the impor- tance it attaches to the European neighbourhood pol- icy as a means to strengthen cooperation with its neigh- bours and expand prosperity, stability and security beyond the borders of the European Union. The Euro- pean neighbourhood policy seeks to support the polit- ical and economic reforms of neighbouring countries on the basis of partnership and building on shared val- ues. The Union is determined to strengthen and further develop its neighbourhood policy, thus offering an increasingly close relationship and substantial support, as neighbouring countries fulfil their commitments to reform. 58. The European Council attaches great importance to a fruitful cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe and encourages them to overcome the remaining difficulties in the ongoing negotiations on a memorandum of understanding. It expresses its appreciation to Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker for his report on the future relations between the Council of Europe and the European Union, which deserves further consideration. 59. The European Council adopted declarations on the western Balkans (Annex II), Iran (Annex III), Iraq (Annex IV), the Middle East peace process (Annex V), Africa (Annex VI), Lebanon (Annex VII) and East Timor (Annex VIII). 60. The European Council endorses the Presidency report on ESDP (doc. 10418/06), which comprises the mandate for the incoming Presidency.

The European Council reaffirmed its full support for the agenda set out at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and for the stabilisation and association process. A peaceful and prosperous Serbia fully integrated into the family of European nations is very important for the stability in the region. The European Council, therefore, recalls that the European Union is willing to resume negotiations with Serbia on a stabilisation and association agreement as soon as full cooperation of Serbia with the ICTY is achieved. The Union maintains its support to the ongoing talks about the future status of Kosovo led by UN Envoy Martti Ahtisaari and stresses the crucial importance of moving forward on the implementation of standards in Kosovo. In close consultation with key international actors, the European Union stands ready to enhance its role in Kosovo following a status determination, in particular in the areas of police, rule of law and the economy. The European Union and its Member States have already agreed to develop their relations with Mon- tenegro as a sovereign, independent state. The Euro- pean Council calls on both Serbia and Montenegro to pursue a direct and constructive dialogue on their future relations. The European Union will continue to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in ensuring stability and progress on key reforms. It urges the Bosnian authorities to ensure real and tangible progress in the implementation of police reform in order to maintain momentum in the stabili- sation and association process. The European Council underlines the importance of proceeding with consti- tutional reform. The European Council calls on all parties in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to ensure that the parliamentary elections on 5 July are conducted in line with international standards. The European Council welcomes the signature of the stabilisation and association agreement with Albania and calls on Albania to push ahead with its reform agenda. The European Council strongly encourages regional cooperation including through the south-east European cooperation process (SEECP). It welcomes the initia- tive for a regional free trade area launched in Bucharest on 6 April, as well as the signing of the agreement on a European common aviation area with the countries of the region on 9 June, and progress made in the ratifi- cation process of the Energy Community Treaty for South-East Europe. The European Union will continue to back its poli- cies for the western Balkans with commensurate financial assistance, particularly through the instru- ment for pre-accession assistance to be introduced next year. The European Council is conscious that the question of visa facilitation is particularly important for the people of the countries of the region. The European Union therefore hopes to adopt negotiation mandates for visa facilitation and readmission agreements in the course of this year, in line with the common approach to the development of the EU policy on visa facilitation agreed in December 2005, so that negotiations can be concluded as soon as possible, ideally in 2007 or ear- lier where possible.

The European Council reiterated its commitment to a diplomatic solution which addresses international concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme while affirm- ing Iran\u2019s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in accordance with the NPT. In this context, the European Council welcomes the important initiative of the EU High Representative, the foreign ministers of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, the Russian Federation and the United States, agreed in Vienna on 1 June 2006. The European Council gives its full sup- port to the balanced approach incorporated in the Vienna initiative, and encourages Iran to take the pos- itive path that is offered. The European Council welcomes the meetings of EU High Representative Javier Solana, accompanied by representatives of France, Germany, the United King- dom and the Russian Federation, with the Iranian authorities in Tehran on 6 June, and the constructive atmosphere in which this visit took place. The European Council urges Iran to give an early pos- itive response to this far-reaching initiative and to cre- ate the conditions whereby negotiations can resume.

The European Council welcomes the formation of the new Iraqi national unity government on 20 May, now completed with the appointment of ministers of defence, interior and national security. This is a major and important step continuing the transformation of Iraq into a democratic country. The European Union reiterates its strong condemnation of terrorist acts and deplores the continuing campaign of violence against the Iraqi people and their constitutionally elected gov- ernment. It calls on all Iraqi citizens to avoid sectarian strife and refrain from using violence, prolonging the suffering of the Iraqi people. The European Union stands ready to renew its engagement with the new Iraqi government and Iraqi citizens in their efforts to bring peace, stability and prosperity to an independent and sovereign Iraq. The European Council welcomes the new govern- ment\u2019s programme for its commitment to upholding the rule of law, promoting national unity and reconcil- iation, protecting and developing Iraq\u2019s resources and using them for the benefit of all the Iraqi people. The European Union looks forward to rapid and early political dialogue with the new government. The European Council welcomes the Commission com- munication and the joint letter from Secretary-General/ High Representative Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. The European Council looks forward to pursuing enhanced engagement with the new gov- ernment at all relevant levels. For example, it is the EU\u2019s intention to support Iraq in the following areas. \u00a1 Endorse a model of democratic government that overcomes divisions, e.g. through support to national reconciliation and the constitutional review process in close cooperation with the UN. In this context, the European Council welcomed the United Nations mul- tiparty dialogue on the Iraqi bill of rights in Vienna from 6 to 8 June. \u00a1 Contribute towards the rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights, e.g. through Community assistance in these areas. In this context, the European Council notes the agreement to extend the integrated rule of law mission for Iraq, EUJUST LEX, for another 18 months after the expiration of the current mandate in response to Iraqi needs and requests. \u00a1 Support national and regional authorities in improv- ing the delivery of basic services and in promoting job creation. \u00a1 Support Iraq\u2019s economic recovery and prosperity, e.g. by launching the negotiations of a trade and coop- eration agreement and by commencing a technical dia- logue on energy. \u00a1 Promote the development of an effective and trans- parent administrative framework. \u00a1 Stepping up its presence in Iraq through the immi- nent appointment of the head of the European Com- mission delegation in Iraq. The European Council encourages enhanced interna- tional engagement and underlines the EU\u2019s willingness to continue supporting the UN\u2019s role in Iraq.

        "Annexes to the Presidency conclusions 20 Bull. EU 6-2006 and lasting solution based on existing agreements, the relevant UNSC resolutions and the principles laid down in the roadmap. In view of the urgent need to relaunch the process towards a negotiated two-state solution which would bring peace to both the Israeli and the Palestinian peo- ple, the European Council calls for an early engage- ment between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Pres- ident of the Palestinian Authority, who was elected on a platform of peace. It reiterates its expectations from both parties to respect existing agreements and obli- gations, including the roadmap. As set out by the Quartet, the Hamas-led Palestinian government needs to meet and implement the three principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist and acceptance of existing agreements and obligations. The European Council remains concerned by the secu- rity situation in Gaza and the West Bank. It condemns the violence against Palestinian civilians. It condemns the launching of Qassem rockets against population centres in Israel. It reminds both parties of their respon- sibility to protect civilian lives. It calls on the Pales- tinian Authority to take action to improve security and prevent terrorist attacks on Israel. It reiterates its con- demnation of extra-judicial killings. It calls on all par- ties to refrain from violence and to exercise restraint. The European Council calls on all Palestinian political forces to engage in a national dialogue aimed prima- rily at putting an end to inter-Palestinian confrontation and establishing law and order. It calls on the Pales- tinian government to cooperate with the President of the Palestinian Authority to achieve this, including through the disarmament of groups engaged in vio- lence and terror. The European Council takes note of the announcement by President Abbas to hold a referendum. It calls on all Palestinian political forces to work towards the widest possible consensus in support of the objectives of the roadmap. The European Council calls on Israel to desist from any action that threatens the viability of an agreed two- state solution and from acts that are contrary to inter- national law. Of particular concern are settlement activ- ities, the construction of the barrier on Palestinian land and activities in and around East Jerusalem as well as in the Jordan valley. The European Union will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those agreed to by both sides. The European Council urges Israel to resume transfers of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues which are essential in averting a crisis in the Palestin- ian territories. The European Council stresses the need for a coordi- nated international response to the deterioration of the humanitarian, economic and financial situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The European Council endorses the proposed tempo- rary international mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people, which has been drawn up by the Commission following consultations within the EU as well as with Quartet members, major donors, international financial institutions and partners in the region. The European Council appreciates the Commission\u2019s work so far and requests it to continue urgently establishing the mechanism, in conjunction with Quartet members, other key international partners and the PA President\u2019s office. The European Council agrees that, in order to achieve an immediate impact, the mechanism will focus on essential supplies and running costs for social services and health, supply of utilities including fuel, and social allowances. Other donors, includingArab states, are invited to provide funding and to consider early and substantial contribu- tions. The Community stands ready to contribute a sub- stantial amount to the international mechanism. The European Council furthermore underlines the importance of freedom of movement and urges both parties to take concrete steps to implement their obli- gations under the agreement on movement and access, in order to alleviate the worsening situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The European Council reiterates the importance of pre- serving and pursuing the democratic functioning of the institutions of the Palestinian Authority whose conti- nuity is crucial for a future independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state based on the rule of law.

The European Union remains committed to con- tributing to the African efforts to achieve the millen- nium development goals, with a view to making the African continent stable and prosperous, laying empha- sis on the principles of partnership, responsibility and ownership, good governance, rule of law and respect for human rights. In this context, it reiterates the impor- tance of enhanced EU\u2013Africa political dialogue, includ- ing holding a second EU\u2013Africa summit in Lisbon as soon as possible. The EU is implementing the Africa strategy adopted in December 2005 as the comprehen- sive framework of its activities, and will continue its efforts to transform the EU strategy for Africa into a joint strategy. The strategy puts particular emphasis on the EU\u2019s engagement for peace and security in Africa, as a basis for lasting development, as well as regional and economic integration and development assistance provided to the African partner countries. In this con- text, the EU welcomes the decision taken by the EU and the ACP partners at the joint Council of Ministers on 2 June regarding the financial protocol for 10th EDF (European Development Fund, covering 2008\u201313) and has decided on a short-term replenishment of the funds available under the African peace facility and to con- tinue this instrument in the period 2008 to 2010. The EU reiterates furthermore its support to the economic partnership agreements as instruments for development, aiming at enhanced regional economic integration and contributing to reducing poverty in the ACP countries. In addition, the EU stresses the importance of current and future initiatives to put in place an EU\u2013Africa part- nership on migration and development. The EU also recalls the importance of the conclusion of ambitious action plans, in the framework of the European neigh- bourhood policy, with its Mediterranean partners. In Sudan, the EU will work for the full and rapid imple- mentation of the Darfur peace agreement (DPA) as a pre- condition for lasting peace and security in Darfur and an end to the suffering of millions of people in Darfur. The EU continues to be deeply concerned by the situation of human rights in Darfur and calls upon the government in Khartoum to end impunity by bringing the perpetra- tors to justice for crimes committed in Darfur and to stop the violence against internally displaced persons, espe- cially sexual violence against women and girls. Together with other partners in the international community, the EU will continue to provide support to theAfrican Union mission in Sudan (AMIS), taking into account the new tasks arising from the DPA, and the need to ensure a smooth transition to a UN-led operation in Darfur. The EU calls upon all political forces in the Democ- ratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to continue pursu- ing their path of peaceful and democratic change in the run-up to the elections, starting on July 30. Building on the EU\u2019s longstanding engagement in the DRC, the EU will deploy the military operation EUFOR RD Congo, in response to a request from the United Nations, designed to provide support to MONUC in certain sit- uations. For the same purpose, the EU\u2019s police mis- sion in Kinshasa (EUPOL Kinshasa) will be rein- forced. The EU will continue to support the ongoing security sector reform through its mission EUSEC DRC, as well as new initiatives to ensure good gover- nance, transparency and a sound post-transition and reconstruction strategy. The ongoing process of secur- ing regional stability through the early holding of the second summit of the Great Lakes Conference has the full support of the EU. Annex VII Declaration on Lebanon I.17. The European Council reaffirms the importance it attaches to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Lebanon and reiterates its call for Security Council Resolution 1559 to be implemented in full. It welcomes the adoption of Resolution 1680 and calls for its full implementation, particularly as regards the delineation of the Syrian\u2013Lebanese border. In this context, it calls upon Syria to grasp the hand offered by the Lebanese government following the agreements emerging from the Lebanese national dia- logue. It is pleased that this national dialogue has been opened and encourages the parties to continue it. The European Council reaffirms its full support for the work of the international independent investigation commission into the assassination of Rafik Hariri and his escort, and for the action of its head, Mr Serge Bram- mertz. It welcomes the investigation commission\u2019s fourth interim report, takes note of the progress recorded in the investigation, which is cause for hope for the Lebanese people. It welcomes the Security Council\u2019s adoption of resolution 1686 which extends the mandate of the inde- pendent investigation commission for another year and supports the commission\u2019s intention to extend further its tutorial assistance to ongoing investigations into other political assassinations that have been committed in Lebanon since October 2004. It welcomes the Lebanese authorities\u2019 excellent cooperation with the independent investigation commission and calls once again on all par- ties to cooperate with it fully and unconditionally. The European Council welcomes the adoption of Secu- rity Council Resolution 1664 and expresses the hope that negotiations will progress rapidly with a view to the actual setting up of the international tribunal pro- vided for in that resolution.

The European Council reaffirms its support for the Lebanese government and urges it to undertake the economic and political reforms agreed, so that the international conference to support Lebanon can be held as soon as possible. The implementation of the action plan concluded in the framework of the Euro- pean neighbourhood policy will assist the reform process in the country. Annex VIII Declaration on East Timor I.18. The European Council expresses its deep concern over the present situation in East Timor. It urges all parties to refrain from any further violence and calls for the rapid re-establishment of political dialogue, security and public order conducive to a return to nor- malcy in the country. The European Council believes that the United Nations continues to have a leading role to play in helping the people of East Timor to strengthen internal peace and sustained stability. The agreement in the near future of the mandate of a new and robust UN mission to East Timor, responding to the expectations of the Timorese on the facilitation of political dialogue and reconciliation as well as on the restoration and main- tenance of security, will be of major importance so as to ensure that the 2007 elections will be peaceful, free and fair. The European Union is ready to continue to provide assistance to the people of East Timor to consolidate national independence, peace and democracy. The European Council welcomes the Commission\u2019s humanitarian assistance responding to the flash appeal by the United Nations and its readiness to con- sider stabilisation measures under the rapid reaction mechanism.

The Brussels European Council expressed its gratitude to the Commission for having con- tributed to the reflection period in the context of its Plan D and to the European Parliament for having organised together with the Austrian Par- liament the joint parliamentary meeting on the future of Europe on 8 and 9 May 2006 and it also welcomed the Commission\u2019s contribution \u2018A cit- izen\u2019s agenda for Europe\u2019 ( \u2192 point I.2). The European Council called for the adoption, on 25 March 2007 in Berlin, of a political declara- tion by European Union leaders, setting out Europe\u2019s values and ambitions and confirming their shared commitment to deliver them, com- memorating 50 years of the Treaties of Rome ( \u2192 point I.7).

Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to achieving a constitutional settle- ment for the European Union as quickly as possible as well as its endorsement of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. It expressed its opposition to the piecemeal implementation of parts of the constitutional package deal, as well as its opposition to the immediate creation of core groups of certain Member States as a way of circumventing the constitutional process for the Union as a whole. Parliament called on the Euro- pean Council to move from the period of reflec- tion to a period of analysis extending to mid- 2007, with a view to reaching a clear proposal as to how to proceed with the Constitution no later than the second half of 2007. It thus suggested that the European Council develop an appropriate framework so as to enable a specific dialogue to take place, as soon as the political calendar allows, with the representatives of those countries in which the referendum on the Constitution had a negative outcome, in order to explore whether and under what conditions it would be possible for them to resume the ratification procedure. Finally, Parliament reaffirmed its objective that the constitutional settlement would be ready when the citizens of the Union are called to the European elections in 2009. 1.1.3.

Parliament called on public authorities throughout the European Union to carry out an inquiry as soon as possible on the allegations of severe human rights violations against Roma women and to rapidly bring penal- ties against those responsible with adequate com- pensation for the victims. It also called on the Commission to support, via its many financial mechanisms, the activities relating to Roma women and to re-examine the rules for attribu- tion of every kind of financing in order to ensure specific provisions include Roma women. Parlia- ment also welcomed the proposal to establish an EU Institute for Gender Equality and urged the institute to focus intensively on the situation of women suffering multiple discriminations, including Roma women. In particular, it urged Member States to: regard, as among their highest priorities, measures intended to provide better protection for women\u2019s reproductive and sexual health, prevent and outlaw coercive sterilisation and promote family planning, alternative arrange- ments for those who get married early and sex education; take proactive measures to eliminate racially segregated maternity wards; ensure that programmes are developed to provide services to Roma victims of domestic violence and exercise particular vigilance with respect to the traffick- ing of Roma women. Parliament called upon the Commission and itself, in the context of various funds, to treat as a horizontal objective capacity- building and empowerment of Roma women and their organisations in education, employment, leadership and political participation. 1.5.2.

        "Human rights Bull. EU 6-2006 29 Cooperation in Europe for the effective protec- tion of minorities and stresses the role of non- governmental organisations and national, transna- tional and European associations of regional and local authorities in this process. It wishes the regional dimension to be taken into consideration more extensively in the reports of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and the EU Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights. The Committee considers that the EU could supplement Member States\u2019 activities at local, regional and national levels by allocating suitable appropriations and that the Member States could delegate part of their deci- sion-making powers on the Structural Funds to regional and local authorities, in the spirit of the decentralisation policy conducted by the EU. Finally, it called for appropriate financing of activities at local and regional level aimed at combating discrimination and ensuring that the rights of all citizens are protected. 1.5.3. European Parliament resolution on the increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe.

Parliament deplores the fact that the Council has been unable to adopt the 2001 Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. It urgently called on the future Finnish Presidency of the Council to restart the work on it and on the Council to reach an agreement on explicitly extending it to homo- phobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and other types of offences motivated by phobia or hatred based on ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, reli- gion or other irrational grounds. Parliament urged all the Member States to effectively implement the anti-discrimination directives and the Com- mission to bring before the Court of Justice those Member States which fail to do so, and to submit before mid-2007 new legislative tools incorpo- rating all the grounds for discrimination set out in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and having the same scope as Directive 2000/43/EC. Parlia- ment strongly condemned all racist attacks and expressed its solidarity with all victims of such attacks and their families, including: the premed- itated murder of a black woman of Malian nation- ality and the Belgian child of whom she was the nurse, perpetrated in Antwerp on 12 May 2006 by a young Belgian right-wing extremist, this same person having a few moments earlier seri- ously wounded a woman of Turkish origin while trying to kill her; the murder of a 16-year-old boy in January 2006 and of a 17-year old boy in April 2006 in Brussels, expressing its indignation at some of the media coverage of these murders, which at times led to unfounded criminalisation of whole communities in the eyes of the general public; the rape, torture and assassination of Ilan Halimi in February 2006 in France by a gang of 22 persons of different origins, expressing its deep concern at the anti-Semitic dimension of this crime; the assassination of Cha\u00efb Zehaf in March 2006 in France due to his ethnic ori- gin; the brutal assault on a German citizen of Ethiopian origin, Kevin K., in the village of Poemmelte, Saxony-Anhalt, on 9 January 2006, in particular because of its racial motive; the hor- rific torture and murder of Gisberta, a transsexual living in the Portuguese city of Oporto, in Febru- ary 2006, by a group of adolescent and pre- adolescent minors; the attack against Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland, which took place in Warsaw, as well as the declarations by a leading member of the League of Polish Fami- lies inciting violence against gay, lesbian, bisex- ual and transsexual people with a view to the march for tolerance and equality; the increase in the number of racist attacks, calls and chants by fans with neo-Nazi allegiances in football stadi- ums. Finally, Parliament stressed the need to sup- port anti-racist and anti-xenophobic initiatives in relation to the World Cup in Germany and asks authorities to closely monitor, prosecute and con- demn those responsible for racist acts. 1.5.4.

European Parliament resolution on the sit- uation of women in armed conflicts and their role in the reconstruction and democratic process in post-conflict countries. Reference: Parliament resolution on the participa- tion of women in peaceful conflict resolution: OJ C 228, 13.8.2001; Bull. 11-2000, point 1.2.3 Adopted on 1 June. Parliament called on Member States to enlarge their programmes for taking in children and adolescents from regions in conflict in order to allow them to escape a world of violence which is often aimed at women in particular. It also called on the EU for better control in the distribu- tion of food, clothing and health and sanitation equipment during emergency operations in order to take the specific requirements of women into account. It should also take measures to protect women within refugee camps in order to reduce the risk of violence and sexual abuse against women and girls. Parliament drew attention to the problem of kamikaze women and stressed that rape as a weapon of war concerns all women, whatever their ethnic, religious and ideological differences. Finally, it stressed the positive role played by women in the resolution of conflicts and called on the EU to ensure sufficient technical and financial assistance to support programmes allowing women to take part in peace talks and giving greater pow- ers to women throughout civil society. 1.5.6. Council conclusions on EU guidelines on human rights defenders. Adopted on 12 June. The Council paid tribute to the courage of human rights defenders and expressed its sincere admiration for the invalu- able contribution they make to advancing respect for human rights worldwide. The Council expressed its concern about the ongoing threats and attacks and strongly condemned killings of human rights defenders, as documented in the lat- est report by the United Nations (UN) Special Representative on human rights defenders. It called on all states to ensure the safety and pro- tection of the rights of human rights defenders and called particular attention to the situation of women human rights defenders. The Council also welcomed the first review of the implementation of the European Union guidelines on human rights defenders. It acknowledged progress made towards the implementation of the guidelines but underlined the need to continue efforts to further increase the level of awareness amongst all rele- vant EU actors. The EU is committed to contin- ued close cooperation with civil society in pro- moting human rights and in raising awareness about the content and the purpose of the guide- lines and to advance their full implementation. The Council stressed the importance of the man- date of the UN Special Representative and other relevant special procedures, and the crucial role played by the Special Representative in imple- menting the UN declaration on human rights defenders and enhancing the protection of human rights defenders throughout the world. In view of the newly established Human Rights Council, the Council also underlined the importance the EU attaches to continued access and active participa- tion of human rights defenders and NGOs from the outset. 1.5.7. European Parliament resolution on East Timor. References: Parliament resolution on the situation in East Timor: OJ C 279, 1.10.1999; Bull. 5-1999, point 1.3.109 Parliament resolution on East Timor: Bull. 10- 2001, point 1.2.7 Adopted on 15 June. Parliament urged all parties to refrain from violence, to get involved in an all- inclusive dialogue to settle political differences and to participate in the democratic process within the legal and constitutional framework, thus contributing to restoring social and political stability. It welcomed the decision by the author- ities of East Timor to call for an international inquiry into the events of 28 and 29 April, and 23 to 25 May, when armed confrontations between the East Timorese armed forces and pre- viously dismissed soldiers and their civilian sup- porters resulted in a disputed number of fatali- ties. Parliament stressed that the process of gradual reduction in the United Nations (UN) mission in East Timor over the last four years must be reversed and asks for the urgent deploy- ment of a UN-led police force to help restore sta- bility and a UN-mandated peacekeeping force as requested by the East Timor authorities on 13 June. It welcomed the extension of the UN\u2019s mandate and calls for peacekeeping units and ",
        "Human rights Bull. EU 6-2006 31 civilian police units to remain in East Timor until the country\u2019s own armed forces and police can take over these tasks themselves. Parliament also recommended, with due respect for the sovereign authorities of East Timor and the specificity of the mandate conferred on each one of the inter- national forces currently in the country under UN supervision and monitoring, the establishment of efficient channels of horizontal communication and cooperation between international forces, in order to serve the best interests of the East Tim- orese people, the effective restoration of public order and a prompt return to full institutional nor- mality. Parliament welcomed East Timor\u2019s admis- sion to the ACP group of states and recognised its need for political, technical and financial support in rebuilding the infrastructure and administrative structures which are essential to resume the implementation of its development plan. It called on the international community to substantially increase support for effective human rights mon- itoring in East Timor and to provide assistance for the development of local human rights groups as well as for local services for victims of abuses. It wants the EU to raise European concerns over police violence with the government of East Timor in all official meetings and at the highest level. It called on East Timor state representatives to uphold international human rights standards and to ensure that the police\u2019s and armed forces\u2019 treatment of citizens conforms to international human rights norms and standards. Finally, it pro- posed to send a European Parliament ad hoc del- egation to East Timor next autumn to assess the political situation and examine the adequacy of EU assistance programs. 1.5.8.

Parliament urged the author- ities to release immediately all activists still detained for signing a petition calling for im- proved Syrian\u2013Lebanese relations. It further urged the Syrian authorities to reconsider all cases of political prisoners and immediately release all prisoners of conscience, and to: ensure that the detainees are well treated and not subject to tor- ture or other ill-treatment; ensure that detained or imprisoned persons are given prompt, regular and unrestricted access to their lawyers, doctors and families. Parliament called on Syria to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and strongly supported the declaration of 19 May 2006 by the EU Presidency on behalf of the European Union regarding the recent arrests in Syria. Parliament pointed out that respect for human rights constitutes a vital component in any future EU\u2013Syria association agreement and call on Syria to respect its commitments within the framework of the Barcelona process and along the lines of the European neighbourhood policy. It reasserted the necessity for the Com- mission and the Council also to do their utmost to ensure that the association agreement with Syria, which has not yet been signed, leads to an improvement of human rights in Syria. Finally, Parliament called on the Commission to annually assess the human rights situation in Syria and its compliance with the obligations under the Euro-Mediterranean agreement and to report its findings within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. 1.5.9.

Parliament deplores the lack of cooperation by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) with international human rights institutions and particularly its refusal to follow the procedures of the United Nations Commission on human rights. It called on the government of North Korea to: abide by the principles set out in the international human rights treaties it has ratified (such as the Interna- tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and incorporate these principles into domestic law; ",
        "Human rights 32 Bull. EU 6-2006 abolish the death penalty; release all people detained or imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of fundamental human rights; guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of movement for all North Koreans; review existing legislation to ensure that it conforms with international human rights standards and introduce safeguards to pro- vide citizens with protections and remedies against human rights violations. Parliament urged the DPRK government to provide information on the case of Mr Son Jong Nam and to stop his exe- cution. It called on the Commission and the Council to do likewise. Parliament also called on the North Korean authorities to review carefully the situation of all those condemned to death and to grant them a stay of execution, and called for the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn, to be allowed to visit them. The resolution urges the government of the DPRK to end the severe human rights violations, including imprisonment and execution on account of reli- gion or belief, against citizens not affiliated to the state-sponsored religious federations, and to allow religious believers to meet freely for wor- ship, build and maintain places of worship and freely publish religious literature. It urged both sides to endeavour to restart the dialogue on human rights between the EU and the DPRK. It called on the government of the DPRK to ful- fil its obligations under human rights instruments to which it is a party and ensure that humanitar- ian organisations, independent human rights monitors, the UN special rapporteur on the situ- ation of human rights in the DPRK and the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief have free access to the country. It wel- comed the agreement between the World Food Programme and the government of the DPRK to support 1.9 million of the most vulnerable people, especially women and young children. It stressed that there should always be targeted and fair distribution of food in the country. Par- liament called on the government of the DPRK to hand over finally and completely all information on the citizens of South Korea and Japan who were abducted during recent decades and imme- diately to release those abductees still being held in its country. It also called on the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China to stop repa- triating North Korean citizens to the DPRK, where, regardless of their reasons for leaving, they face harsh treatment, ranging from detention to torture, long prison terms and even executions. Finally, Parliament called on the Republic of Korea (ROK) to assume its responsibility for North Korean refugees in China and on the gov- ernment of the ROK to allow them to travel to South Korea. 1.5.10.

Parliament pointed out that Tunisia and the European Union have been linked since 1998 by a Euro-Mediterranean asso- ciation agreement, Article 2 of which contains a human rights clause constituting an essential ele- ment of that agreement. It regrets the fact that the situation as regards freedoms and human rights in Tunisia is still a cause for concern and called on the Tunisian authorities to fulfil their interna- tional commitments. Parliament expects the Tunisian authorities to provide explanations for the ban on the congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) and for any acts of vio- lence against defenders of human rights and Tunisian judges. It called on the Presidency of the Council to make a public statement on the ban on holding the LTDH congress and on the ",

It reiterated its request to the Council and the Commission to organise a meeting of the Association Council in order to discuss the human rights situation in Tunisia. It called on the Council and the Commission to take swiftly all necessary steps vis-\u00e0-vis the Tunisian authorities to ensure that European funding allocated to civil society projects is unblocked and that Mr Mohammed Abbou is released; calls for the activities of human rights defenders to be fully guaranteed, in accordance with the relevant EU guidelines. Parliament also called on the Commission to do everything pos- sible to ensure that the project for the support of reform of the justice system guarantees the inde- pendence of the judiciary and freedom of action for judges. It called on the Tunisian authorities to agree to a visit by the United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. Finally, Parliament called for the work of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assem- bly (EMPA) to be facilitated by better coopera- tion between the Tunisian Presidency in terms of respecting human rights and expects to see sig- nificant improvements in this area, particularly with a view to the forthcoming EMPA plenary session. 1.5.11.

The objective of the pro- posal for a new financing instrument for the pro- motion of democracy and human rights is to pro- vide a legal basis for the successor programme to the European initiative for democracy and human rights (EIDHR), which is based on two regulations that expire at the end of 2006. The new instrument, like EIDHR, will have the specific mission to assist in meeting European Union (EU) policy objectives regarding the promotion of human rights and democracy in external relations, as indicated in Treaty mandates and articulated in Commission communications, European Parliament resolutions and Council conclusions over the years. These objectives are of a global nature, reflected in EU guidelines on human rights issues and echoed in different ways in the stabilisation and association process, the European neighbourhood policy, and in the Euro- pean consensus on development, as well as in new regional initiatives such the EU strategy for Africa and EU strategic partnership with Latin America and the EU policy towards Asia. The main policy framework for the EIDHR has been set by the 2000 and 2001 Commission commu- nications. The new instrument, will, like EIDHR, be designed to complement the various other tools for implementation of EU policies on democracy and human rights, which range from political dialogue and diplomatic d\u00e9marches to various instruments of financial and technical cooperation, including both geographic and the- matic programmes. It will also complement the more crisis-related interventions of the new sta- bility instrument. COM(2006) 354 ",

For political reasons the Com- mission decided to announce later the final con- version rate between the Slovenian currency (the tolar) and the euro, even if it should remain unchanged (239.640 tolars for a euro) in relation to the rate adopted last March by the Slovenian authorities to accompany the launching of dual pricing. This rate corresponds to the central rate adopted two years sooner when Slovenia entered the mechanism of European exchanges.

Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled \u2018Public finances in EMU 2006 \u2014 the first year of the revised Stability and Growth Pact\u2019. Adopted on 13 June. The Commission gave a positive assessment of the first year of applica- tion of the revised Stability Pact. It gave the opportunity to Member States in an excessive deficit situation to return under or near the 3% threshold, thanks to more practical adjustment times and structural measures. This new pact leads to renewed credibility but its preventive arm calls for more effort from Member States which would be wise to consolidate their public finances. The Commission also noted that, despite growth of 2.3% in GDP in 2006 (as opposed to 1.6% last year), the average EU pub- lic deficit is expected to be around that of the level in 2005 \u2014 2.3% of GDP. COM(2006) 304 Excessive deficit procedure Cyprus 1.6.5. Commission recommendation for a Coun- cil decision abrogating Decision 2005/184/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Cyprus.

The Commission recommended abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure against Cyprus after the deficit fell to 2.4% of GDP in 2005 and is projected to decrease further in 2006 and 2007. Indeed, Cyprus\u2019s debt to GDP ratio also dropped to 70 1 \u2044 4 %, in 2005 and is seen at 68% in 2007. Of the six new Member States that were put into the excessive deficit procedure upon European Union membership, Cyprus is the first to see the procedure abrogated. SEC(2006) 787 Portugal 1.6.6.

The Commission is of the opinion that Portugal is on track to correct its excessive deficit by 2008, provided it strictly implements the 2006 budget and pursues a rigor- ous budgetary consolidation strategy in 2007 and following years. At present it does not appear necessary to recommend any further steps under the excessive deficit procedure. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely, par- ticularly in light of the significant risks and uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the budget.

Adopted on 22 June. In this report, the Commis- sion concludes that the preparations to adopt the euro in 2007 in Slovenia are at an advanced stage as expected, subject to a favourable decision of the Council currently scheduled for 11 July. It noted that more work is needed to fully address citizens\u2019 fears about price increases. In addition to ",

EU 6-2006 37 adequate price monitoring, Slovenia should pro- mote a fair-pricing agreement between retailers and consumers, in which retailers commit not to use the introduction of the euro as an opportunity for price rises. Such agreements have proved use- ful to creating a climate of confidence and aware- ness in the past. Slovenia must also ensure that banks are fully ready to dispense euro cash at automatic machines from the first day and stay open longer during this period. There should also be a sufficient number of euro kits to enable Slovenian citizens to familiarise themselves with euro coins in the second half of December. The Commission also encourages the countries which aspire to adopt the euro in 2008 to speed up their own preparations. COM(2006) 322 Slovenia 1.6.8.

Favourable, subject to certain amendments. Firstly, Parliament proposed to extend the initial transitional periods presented by the Commission. The second essential modi- fication concerns the clarification of the condi- tions in which confidential data can be transmit- ted. It appeared to Parliament that confidential document transmission between national statisti- cal agencies has to be carried out exclusively for statistical purposes and that, in all cases, national legislation has to be respected. Moreover, national central banks should also be party to these exchanges. This is why a series of amend- ments were made in this regard. Lastly, a series of other technical amendments were made, in particular in order to specify that several defini- tions and clarifications have to be left to the comitology procedure. 1.7.2.

Favourable, subject to some amend- ments. Parliament requested that, within three years of the date of entry into force of the future regulation, and again every three years there- after, that the Commission submit a report to Parliament and the Council on the statistics com- piled pursuant to the future regulation and in particular on their relevance and quality. The report shall also analyse the cost-effectiveness of the system used for the collection and pro- cessing of statistics and shall put forward best practices for lessening the workload for Mem- ber States and enhancing the usefulness and quality of the data. 1.7.3.

According to the report, since the first transmissions, considerable progress has been achieved and non-financial quarterly accounts of public services were still developed. In the majority of the countries, data is of high quality and usable for analyses, and should therefore be diffused. Some Member States have to take specific measures to improve the quality of the communicated standards. In some cases, improvement was possible due to Community obligation to forward chronological series to Eurostat. COM(2006) 350 ",

Parliament deplored the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not yet been made legally binding, requested that this situation be remedied and called upon Member States to take due account in their legislative practice of the various grounds for discrimination set out in Article 21 of the Char- ter of Fundamental Rights. It called on those Member States which do not already have such bodies to set up, at national level, a specialised administrative body for equality and the fight against discrimination. Parliament pointed out that the principle of equal treatment does not prevent a Member State from retaining or adopt- ing specific measures intended to prevent or to compensate for the disadvantages linked to one of the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the European Communities (EC) Treaty. It noted with satisfaction that the Com- mission intends to create (in cooperation with the Member States\u2019 authorities and other parties involved) statistical tools designed to assess the impact of discrimination. It greatly regretted that the Commission is not planning at this stage to draw up comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination and insisted that a new legislative tool incorporating all the grounds for discrimi- nation set out in Article 13 of the EC Treaty be submitted before mid-2007. Parliament also called upon the Commission to actively fulfil its obligations as guardian of the treaties and to undertake urgent action against Member States that have failed to transpose EC law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty, such as Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC.

Parliament, bearing in mind the objectives of better regulation and enforce- ment on a truly level playing field for financial markets, generally supported the use of imple- menting measures. However, it asked the Com- mission to take the utmost account of the limits on its powers conferred by Directive 2004/39/EC, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the EC Treaty, in order to ensure legal certainty for financial market players. Moreover, it pointed out that, despite the generally cooperative approach amongst European Union institutions, there are structural deficiencies in the way in which the delegation of legislative powers to the Commission occurs, which are capable of jeop- ardising the outcome of important regulations such as the implementing measures. Parliament signaled its willingness to continue to improve the functioning of the interinstitutional relation- ship across the whole range of policy areas, and especially within the Lamfalussy process, with a view to reaching a lasting and mutually satisfac- tory solution, which puts Parliament on an equal footing with the Council when calling back the delegation of legislative powers. Furthermore, it noted the importance of consolidating the role of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) in coordinating the activities of national regulators and with a view to promoting regula- tory convergence, and as the indispensable key advisor at European level for issues falling within its competence. Finally, it called on Member States to provide the CESR with the means nec- essary to put into effect Directive 2004/39/EC and its implementing measures. 1.10.2.

In light of the review of all the derogations expiring by the end of 2006 from Directive 2003/96/EC, the Commission con- cluded that: the general provisions of the directive take appropriate account of most situations mer- iting particular treatment. Following the expiry of the derogations, the general provisions of the directive (in particular its optional provisions) allow Member States to continue to apply most of the fiscal measures concerned without needing any prior approval from the Council.

Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a competitive- ness and innovation framework programme (2007\u201313).

Parliament adopted, by a majority, the competi- tiveness and innovation programme (CIP) for 2007\u201313. It aims to support actions allowing for the innovative capacity of small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) to be developed and their competitiveness enhanced. The CIP also aims to encourage all forms of innovation, speed up the establishment of a sustainable, competi- tive and innovative information society accessible to all, and promote energy efficiency as well as new and renewable energy sources in all sectors, including transport. Industrial policies 1.12.2. Committee of the Regions opinion on the Commission communication \u2018Implementing the Community Lisbon programme: A policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing \u2014 Towards a more integrated approach for indus- trial policy\u2019. Commission communication: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 474; Bull. 10-2005, point 1.3.36 Reference: European Economic and Social Com- mittee opinion on the Commission communication: Bull. 4-2006, point 1.12.1 Adopted on 15 June. The Committee fully approved the Commission\u2019s proposals. However, it underlined that particular attention should not only be paid to the management of structural changes in industry, but also, and in parallel, to the new legislation simplification programme. Moreover, the Committee pleaded for a more explicit reference to the regional innovation pol- icy of the Commission. The Committee under- lined that the set-up of the trans-sectoral initiative will make it possible, in particular, to develop a modern and better integrated European industrial policy. The Committee insisted that the new industrial policy should be envisaged within the framework of the Lisbon strategy and in the con- text of globalisation and requested explicitly to stimulate regional economic complex training in Europe (the European \u2018valleys\u2019). Promoting entrepreneurship 1.12.3. Committee of the Regions opinion on the Commission communication \u2018Implementation of the Lisbon programme \u2014 A modern small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) policy for growth and employment\u2019. Commission communication: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 551; Bull. 11-2005, point 1.3.44 Adopted on 15 June. The Committee welcomed the Commission\u2019s communication as a means to give fresh impetus to SME policy, to re-focus pol- icy on the most essential elements and to stream- line Community action with a view to greater effectiveness. It acknowledged the reference to the role of local and regional authorities in the communication but considers that it could have been more explicit regarding the crucial role that local and regional authorities have in supporting SMEs, in providing an enabling environment for ",
        "Enterprise Bull. EU 6-2006 51 their development and transfer, and as large cus- tomers for the goods and services provided by SMEs. It also considered that implementation, and commitment to implementation, by all stake- holders is obviously vital to a successful SME policy and feels that in this regard the Commis- sion should have set out in the communication some specific targets and deadlines to help meas- ure delivery. Concerning the promotion of entre- preneurship and skills, the Committee highlighted the value of local and regional initiatives in fos- tering entrepreneurial mindsets and promoting and delivering entrepreneur-friendly education at all levels within the school system, but considers that many education and training initiatives are not sufficiently responsive or flexible to meet SME needs. With regards to the improvement of SMEs access to markets, it noted the Commis- sion\u2019s proposals in relation to improving access to public procurement for SMEs. Moreover, the Committee welcomed the commitments of the Commission to simplify the rules and regulations to make it easier for SMEs to access Community programmes. Concerning the improvement of SMEs growth potential, it welcomed the com- mitment to increase SME participation in EU programmes and initiatives but considers that spe- cific programme commitments would need to be closely monitored to ensure that these commit- ments are indeed being met. 1.12.4.

In addition to the simplifi- cation of procedures, the Commission plans to reduce the number of markets currently subject to ex ante rules, thanks to the effective liberalisa- tion of several of them and to create an inde- pendent regulator of the telecommunications sec- tor that will oversee application of the European regulations by national agencies. It hopes, on the other hand, to extend liberalisation to frequencies in order to rationalise the use of the spectrum, and, in order to achieve this, foresees bringing in exchange of frequencies between operators at European level for certain portions of the spec- trum, and to create a European agency responsi- ble for managing the system in order to simplify the process, currently managed by 25 national authorities. The Commission, moreover, is study- ing how appropriate it is to separate the activi- ties of services to individuals from network activ- ities of telecom operators in order to strengthen competition especially for broadband, after the practice used in the United States. Finally, the Commission will pursue four fundamental objectives during its review, which will result in a formal legal proposal at the end of the year: consolidation of the internal market, the strength- ening of user and consumers\u2019 interests, improved network security and the elimination of obsolete provisions.

The Council proposed the implementation of an e-government action plan, in order to develop cross-border services accessi- ble to all Europeans. This action plan will create an appropriate European framework for putting public services online. It recalled the Commission necessity to intensify collaboration between pub- lic administrations at all levels across Member States, to ensure coherent and efficient use of the programme, continue assessment of the economic and social impact of cross-border e-government services, launch pilot projects and produce an annual report. In order to ensure secure access to public services online, the Council also recalled the need to set up an electronic identification sys- tem based on international standards, a common terminology and personal data protection. 1.14.3.

Commission communication: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 465; Bull. 9-2005, point 1.3.56 Adopted on 14 June. While favourable to the dig- italisation of cultural heritage, the Committee noted that this is a long-term initiative requiring significant funding, continuous maintenance, updating and content conversion. The Committee also hoped there would be real cooperation between archives, museums and other institu- tions. It highlighted that regional and local authorities play an essential part in the provision of cultural heritage and literature in electronic form, because it is thanks to them that these con- tents reach the citizens. Regional and local authorities are also very involved in the mainte- nance of libraries, bringing attention to the regional and local dimensions within the frame- work of the initiative on digital libraries.

        "58 Bull. EU 6-2006 15. Economic and social cohesion General 1.15.1. Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled \u2018The growth and jobs strategy and the reform of European cohesion policy \u2014 Fourth progress report on cohesion\u2019. Previous report: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 192; Bull. 5-2005, point 1.3.44 Adopted on 12 June. This fourth progress report begins by setting the scene with an update on trends in, and disparities between, the Member States and regions. This is followed by an outline of the key developments in the policy framework including the agreement on the resources for cohesion policy at the European Council in De- cember 2005. With the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy, cohesion policy has been recognised as the primary instrument at Community level ensuring the implementation of the growth and jobs strategy. This reflects the view that, today, strategies designed at local and regional levels must form an integral part of the effort to pro- mote growth and the key drivers of growth such as innovation. The nature of the growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda (which emphasises the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the importance of clusters, the need for local inno- vation centres) is such that in many cases it often has to be built from below, at the regional and local levels. Moreover, this applies not only to the economic agenda but also to the broader effort to involve citizens who, through the partnership and multilevel governance arrange- ments under which cohesion policy is managed, have the chance to become directly involved in the Union\u2019s growth and jobs strategy. The report also emphasised that over the past year, the Com- mission has been developing new instruments to assist Member States and the regions to improve the quality of projects while, at the same time, making Community financial resources work harder by increasing the leverage effect of cohesion policy. Accordingly, for the new programmes, specific initiatives have been developed to promote financial engineering for start-ups and micro-enterprises, combining tech- nical assistance and grants, with non-grant instru- ments such as loans, equity, venture capital or guarantees. These actions will be undertaken through enhanced cooperation between the Com- mission and the European Investment Bank and other international financial institutions on finan- cial engineering. The added value of cooperation in this field includes providing additional loan resources for business formation and develop- ment in the regions of the European Union; con- tributing financial and managerial expertise from specialist institutions such as the EIB and other international financial institutions, as well as from the financial sector in general; creating strong incentives for successful implementation by ben- eficiaries by combining grants with loans; and ensuring long-term sustainability through the revolving character of the grant contribution to financial engineering actions.

Proposal for a Council regulation intro- ducing specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands and amending Reg- ulation (EC) No 1782/2003. Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricul- tural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers: OJ L 270, 21.10.2003; Bull. 9-2003, point 1.3.75 Reference: Council Regulation (EEC) No 2019/93 introducing specific measures for the smaller Aegean islands concerning certain agricultural products: OJ L 184, 27.07.1993 Adopted on 2 June. The adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 2019/93 introducing specific meas- ures for the smaller Aegean islands concerning certain agricultural products has proven to be effective in promoting agriculture and securing supplies to these islands. However, the manage- ment of these arrangements has not been per- fect. The Commission has therefore proposed changing the philosophy behind the way assis- tance is provided for these smaller islands by encouraging participation in decision-making and speeding up the response to their specific needs. This proposal envisages the presentation by Greece of a programme concerning the smaller Aegean islands. This programme will include a section on the specific supply arrange- ments for those agricultural products which are essential in the smaller Aegean islands for human consumption, as agricultural inputs or for processing, and another section on support for local production. This proposal does not envis- age a modification of the sources of financing or the intensity of Community support. It does envisage financing of the programme by the Community under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guar- antee Section, at 100% up to an annual ceiling established by the Council regulation. Part of this aid will have to be reserved for local agri- cultural production. COM(2006) 264 Environment and agriculture, forests 1.17.2.

The action plan provides a framework for forest-related actions at Commu- nity and Member State level and serves as an instrument of coordination between Community actions and the forest policies of the Member States. The overall objective of the European Union forest action plan is to support and enhance sustainable forest management and the multifunctional role of forests. To this end, it has four main objectives: \u00a1 improving long-term competitiveness; \u00a1 improving and protecting the environment; \u00a1 contributing to the quality of life; \u00a1 fostering coordination and communication. The action plan 2007\u201311 consists of a set of key actions which the Commission proposes to imple- ment jointly with the Member States according to their specific conditions and priorities, with support from existing Community instruments, although implementation may also require national instruments.

Proposal for a Council regulation adapt- ing Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricul- tural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union. Regulation to be modified: Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005: OJ L 277, 21.10.2005; Bull. 9-2005, point 1.3.62 Commission proposal: OJ C 104, 3.5.2006; COM(2006) 149; Bull. 4-2006, point 1.17.6 Adopted on 19 June. The Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development introduced general rules governing Community support for rural development policy for the period 2007 to 2013 and established pri- orities and measures for rural development.

COM(2006) 258 Agricultural prices and related measures 1.17.10. Proposal for a Council regulation amend- ing Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector. Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003: OJ L 270, 21.10.2003; Bull. 9-2003, point 1.3.75 Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/ 2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy: OJ L 209, 11.8.2005; Bull. 6-2005, point 1.3.82 Adopted on 23 June. This proposal for a regula- tion amends Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/ 2003 with the aim of meeting two objectives. First of all, due to the new common agricultural policy financing, the milk levy paid by Member States shall be regarded as assigned revenue as of 1 January 2007. This proposal aims to amend the existing regulation so that the levy due shall be paid by Member States in the period between 16 October to 30 November of each year rather than before 1 October under the current rules, thus making the levy available at the start of the budget year in order to improve budgetary fore- casting and make budgetary management more flexible. Furthermore, in some new Member States, the dairy sector has quickly adapted to the new commercial opportunities in an ex- tended European market, generating a substantial restructuring process. Due to this situation, but also due to stricter hygiene provisions for direct sales after accession, it appears that individual producers to a large extent have chosen not to apply for individual reference quantities for direct sales. Consequently, in some new Member States, the total individual reference quantities allocated to the producers for direct sales are substantially below the national reference quantities and unused quantities remain therefore in the national reserves for direct sales, hindering a further restructuring. This proposal thus aims to provide exceptionally for a single transfer of the national reference quantity from direct sales to deliveries, for the quota year 2005/06, upon request by the new Member States concerned. COM(2006) 330 Market organisations Fruit and vegetables 1.17.11. Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the sit- uation of the sector of soft fruits and cherries intended for processing. Reference: Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables: OJ L 118, 20.5.1972, as replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 (OJ L 297, 21.11.1996; Bull. 10-1996, point 1.3.140), the latter as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2699/2000: OJ L 311, 12.12.2000; Bull. 12-2000, point 1.3.117 Adopted on 28 June. Accession to the European Union (EU) of new Member States with a size- able sector of soft fruits and other red fruits for processing considerably changed the overall pic- ture of the sector in the EU. With the addition of two important producers, Hungary and Poland, the EU became the world\u2019s largest producer of soft fruit for the processing industry. In particu- lar, Poland represents two thirds of all EU soft fruits and sour cherries produced for the pro- cessing industry. Several fruits intended for pro- cessing have faced difficulties in recent years in the EU market with drops in prices (producer prices and prices of semi-processed products). These difficulties can be attributed to three main categories of factors, which apply differently from product to product: ",
        "Agriculture and rural development 64 Bull. EU 6-2006 \u00a1 increased competition from third countries (in the strawberry sector); \u00a1 excessive production in comparison with market needs; \u00a1 insufficient competitiveness of segments of the sector generated by fragmented commodity chains (low levels of organisation of producers, etc.). As for other crop sectors, temporary difficulties can emerge also due to circumstances (e.g. unfavourable weather). Compensation for farm- ers who face losses due to unfavourable weather are allowed within the EU rules on agricultural state aid. In this context, the Commission is pro- posing to simplify these rules and to facilitate cri- sis support. Non-harvesting could be a tool in the case of unexpected and temporary difficulties due to oversupply of the market. For each category of problems, the Commission carried out a review of existing Community policy instruments that could be mobilised. The Commission has deduced from its review that most problems can be solved using existing instruments. It considered, in par- ticular, that through the common market organi- sation for fruit and vegetables and rural develop- ment programmes, the EU possesses appropriate tools to improve the functioning of the commod- ity chains in the sector of soft fruits and cherries. The Commission thus indicates that both this report and the accompanying Commission staff working document on a \u2018review of the sector of soft fruits and cherries intended for processing in the EU\u2019 will be duly considered, together with external evaluations and impact assessments, in the elaboration of the reform of the common mar- ket organisation for fruit and vegetables.

The aim of the regu- lation is to extend until the end of the 2007/ 2008 marketing year the processing aid for short flax fibre and hemp fibre (EUR 90 per tonne) and for long flax fibre (EUR 160 per tonne for 2006/2007, 2007/2008, EUR 200 per tonne for 2008/2009 onwards). The regulation also provides for an extension of transitional additional aid (from EUR 50 per hectare to EUR 120 per hectare depending on the differ- ent regions) in certain regions of Belgium, France and the Netherlands, until the 2007/2008 marketing year, in order to continue enabling gradual adaptation of farm structures to the new market conditions. In addition, it provides for making the cultivation of hemp for other indus- trial uses also eligible for the single payment scheme, and not only hemp grown for fibre. It will apply as of its date of entry into force (1 July 2006), with the exception of Article 2 (production of hemp) which will apply from 1 January 2007. OJ L 175, 29.6.2006 Eggs 1.17.13.

Its purpose is to formally initiate discus- sion with all the stakeholders and European institutions with a view to making legislative pro- posals toward the end of 2006, notably: \u00a1 to address, among other things, excessive wine stocks and overproduction; \u00a1 to propose a simpler, more transparent and more market-oriented policy, \u00a1 to contribute to a culture of responsible drinking and to reducing alcohol-related harm throughout the European Union.

The key changes made by the agreement on the EFF are: regarding the scope of the Regulation: Commu- nity support is extended to inland fishing and fisheries areas; the objectives of the Fund now include promotion of the sustainable development of inland fishing; the financial amounts allocated to the EFF have been set at roughly EUR 3.85 billion following agreement on the draft on the financial perspectives; extension of the scope of axis one; investment on board fishing vessels and selectivity; aid for young fishermen; invest- ment aid in aquaculture, inland fishing processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture prod- ucts; balance of fleet entries/exits and lastly pub- lic aid for fishing vessels in the outermost regions. 1.18.2.

Parliament stressed that inshore fisheries make a vital contribution not only to local economies but also to maintaining the social fabric of coastal communities, given that they contribute more jobs per amount of fish caught than other segments of the fleets, particu- larly in island or remote coastal areas. It believed that it is appropriate for the new European Fish- eries Fund (EFF) to finance the provision of fuel- efficient engines and environment-friendly fish- ing gear and improvements in on-board working conditions for inshore fisheries, and called on the Commission to finance the modernisation of inshore fishery vessels. Parliament therefore called on the Commission to bring forward spe- cific educational and training programmes for the inshore fishery sector, notably so as to encourage the entry of young professionals into the sector, and to provide adequate funding in order to ensure the full implementation and success of those programmes. Lastly Parliament believes that any new inshore fisheries legislation must pay special attention to the need to establish and maintain a safety culture in which safety is given the highest priority, and to ensure that safety rules appropriate to the inshore sector are properly implemented; Parliament also insisted that such a safety culture must start by ensuring a more secure and modern fleet with the capacity to include new safety equipment and material, it being necessary to this end to continue with the granting of aid for the renewal and modernisa- tion of the fleet under the future EFF, as already approved by Parliament. 1.18.3.

The Council acknowl- edged that the introduction of frontloading and the presentation of the Baltic Sea fishing oppor- tunities as a separate proposal have contributed in a constructive manner to the legislative process. The introduction of more multiannual ",
        "Fisheries and maritime affairs 68 Bull. EU 6-2006 decisions and long-term plans have also made a positive contribution to reducing ad hoc annual decision-making. It recognised the need to ensure the availability of scientific advice in good time for the preparation of appropriate proposals. The Council underlined the impor- tance of formally adopting and publishing the regulation in good time. It recalled its commit- ment to respect the general principles on the quality of drafting of Community legislation and on better law-making. The Council invited the Commission to: examine the timetable of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Com- mittee for Fisheries (STECF) and the Interna- tional Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) work with a view to presenting this advice at an earlier stage where appropriate, if possible starting from 2007; present a policy statement, in April every year, on the general approach to setting total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas and on associated condi- tions; present its proposals by the first week of September, after consulting the relevant regional advisory councils (RACs), on stocks where the scientific advice from ICES is avail- able in June; present its proposals as early as possible in November on remaining stocks where the scientific advice from ICES is avail- able in October; consult the relevant third coun- tries with a view to advancing the timetable for the conclusion of annual consultations; continue to develop a multiannual management plan approach and lastly to further explore other pos- sibilities, such as the use of multiannual TACs and quotas and a separation in different pro- posals of TACs and quotas from conditions which are not directly associated. 1.18.4.

The expenditure incurred in the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products has been financed by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guar- antee Fund (EAGGF) laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy. The Com- mission has implemented the budget related to this expenditure by shared management with the Member States. The new European Agri- cultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy will replace the EAGGF Guarantee Section from 16 October 2006. The EAGF will finance measures relating to fisheries markets by cen- tralised management. Therefore it is necessary to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 104/ 2000 in order to enable the application of the EAGF as regards the financing of the expendi- ture relating to fisheries markets.

These communications con- stitute the answer to the call made by the European Council in December 2004 for the Commission to report in 2006 on the progress made and to propose the necessary additions to the Hague programme. The aim of this package of communications is thus not to identify new priorities compared to those set out by the Hague programme but rather to take stock of the progress made, to assess the level of implementation at European Union (EU) and national level and to propose a thorough evalua- tion of results. The Commission acknowledges the need to revitalise the Union and to find a new impetus in the area of freedom, security and justice and intends for this package to stimulate discus- sion on new policy initiatives it considers neces- sary, and possible ways to improve the function- ing of freedom, security and justice policies within the framework of the current treaties. The proposed strategic evaluation mechanism builds upon and consolidates results achieved in other areas of EU policies and consists of three steps: firstly, the set- ting up of a system for information gathering and sharing; secondly, creating a reporting mechanism which consolidates, uses and analyses the infor- mation, and thirdly, completion by in-depth strate- gic evaluations. It is hoped that the mechanism will inform political decision-making at the appropri- ate level and provide policymakers with relevant information in time for the follow-up to the Hague programme, which expires in 2009.

Reference: Council Decision 2004/927/EC pro- viding for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty: OJ L 396, 31.12.2004; Bull. 12-2004, point 1.1.3 Adopted on 28 June. Purpose: to contribute to the adaptation of the special provisions of Article 68 of the EC Treaty, which should consist of align- ing the Court of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction on the gen- eral scheme of the Treaty. In the development of the area of freedom, security and justice, respect ",
        "Area of freedom, security and justice 72 Bull. EU 6-2006 for fundamental rights must occupy an essential place. Article 68 of the EC Treaty currently pro- vides for special measures that restrict the juris- diction of the Court of Justice in matters covered by Title IV of the Treaty (asylum, immigration, visas, cooperation in civil matters, and other poli- cies related to the free movement of persons). Article 67(2) of the EC Treaty requires the Coun- cil, at the end of the five-year transitional period, to take a decision with a view to adapting the pro- visions concerning the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice; however, although the transitional period expired on 1 May 2004, the Council has not yet fulfilled that obligation.

The Council adopted guide- lines on consular protection for European Union (EU) citizens in third countries, aimed at strengthening consular cooperation, especially in situations where the safety of European Union citizens is endangered. Implementation of the guidelines is left to the discretion of the heads of missions or posts in light of local circumstances.

Parliament reaffirmed the vital role of its Committee on Petitions in recon- necting with the citizens of the European Union (EU) and in reinforcing the democratic legiti- macy and accountability of the EU decision- making process in the eyes of European public opinion. It stressed that further cooperation between Parliament, the Ombudsman and the Commission is mutually beneficial in ful- filling their common objectives to improve EU administration and developing better quality and more citizen-inspired legislation. Parliament expressed its growing concern at the unreason- able and excessive amount of time which the Commission takes to pursue and conclude infringement proceedings after they are eventu- ally launched, and its dissatisfaction with the frequent examples of Member States\u2019 non- compliance with decisions of the Court of Jus- tice. However, it acknowledged and welcomed the steps made to strengthen the secretariat of the committee in order to cover the need for lin- guistic, legal and political expertise and stresses that this process should continue, so that response times may become shorter, investiga- tions even more effective and its service be equally available to all citizens of the EU. It concluded by recalling that since 1998 Parlia- ment has called for a review of the interinstitu- tional agreement of 1989 and reiterated its urgent request for the Council and the Com- mission to undertake this review with a view to a more effective means of redress and defining a clear and coherent framework for essential cooperation between the institutions.

The Commission has sup- ported judicial training for a number of years through various financial programmes. The adop- tion of a corpus of legislation that has become substantial and that must now be implemented by practitioners of justice, coupled with the devel- opment of the mutual recognition principle, which rests primarily on a high degree of mutual confidence between Member States\u2019 judicial sys- tems, means that judicial training is now a major issue. The purpose of this communication is to make the Commission more involved in judicial training notwithstanding the fact that the matter falls within the competence of Member States. This communication examines current provisions for judicial training in the different Member States, outlines the different contributions made by the European Union and the difficulties encountered in that regard. It sets out a number of proposals for the future and expresses the political will to make substantial resources avail- able to judicial training. Action would focus on three main areas: improving practitioners\u2019 famil- iarity with the Union\u2019s legal instruments, improv- ing mutual understanding of Member States\u2019 dif- ferent legal systems, and improving language training. In addition the Commission intends to build closer partnerships with those responsible for training at both the European and national level by supporting the European Judicial Train- ing Network.

Reference: Council Decision 2005/681/JHA estab- lishing the European Police College (CEPOL) as a European Union body: OJ L 256, 1.10.2005; COM(2004) 623; Bull. 9-2005, point 1.4.11 Approved by the Council on 1 June. The purpose of these agreements is to define the relations between the Icelandic National Police College, the Norwegian Police University College, the Swiss Police Institute and European Police Col- lege (CEPOL) and to establish the arrangements necessary for the facilitated cooperation between them and CEPOL. These cooperation agreements are designed to enhance the effectiveness of the police forces in the fight against crime, especially cross-border crime in Europe, by conducting common trainings for senior police officers to increase knowledge of national police systems, of European cooperation instruments and mech- anisms, as well as of a wide range of specific sub- jects, such as counterterrorism, illegal immigra- tion and border control or trafficking in human beings. 1.19.12.

The Council adopted a rec- ommendation inviting European Union (EU) Member States to make progress on a method for electronic exchange of photos and fingerprints between law enforcement services. The Sirpit (SIRene PIcture Transfer) project has been set up to facilitate the electronic transmission of finger- prints and photos among all EU Member States; at present, the exchange of this kind of informa- tion could take longer than one week, whereas within Sirpit it would take only a few minutes. 1.19.14.

Parliament welcomed the judgment in Case C-176/03, which made it clear that the legal basis on which acts are adopted must be selected by reference to the aim and con- tent of the act itself, and consequently annulled a framework decision on environmental protection which had been mistakenly adopted under the third, rather than the first pillar. It reiterated the urgent need to start the procedure, using Arti- cle 42 of the Treaty on European Union, for inclusion of judicial and police cooperation on criminal matters in the Community pillar. Parlia- ment expressed its agreement with the Commis- sion position on the need to withdraw or amend both pending legislative proposals and pieces of legislation that have already been adopted under the third pillar, whose legal basis is to be regarded as incorrect in the light of the Court\u2019s judgment in Case C-176/03. It reminded the Commission that reviewing the legislation in force, and possi- bly submitting proposals designed to rectify the legal basis while leaving the substance of the leg- islation unchanged, must not involve depriving Parliament of its role as co-legislator. 1.19.17. Council conclusions on the fourth Euro- just annual report (2005). Reference: Council conclusions on the third Euro- just annual report (2004): Bull. 10-2005, point 1.4.18 Adopted on 27 June. The Council welcomed the fourth Eurojust annual report and noted with sat- isfaction that most of the objectives set for 2005 have been successfully attained. In particular, it drew attention to: the progress made in the estab- lishment of a consolidated infrastructure and in the development of Eurojust\u2019s capacity to act as the relevant European counterpart for judicial cooperation and coordination of cross-border and serious crime; the significant increase in the case- load, namely the fact that 588 cases were han- dled, i.e. a 54% increase over the 2004 figures and the fact that these were mainly complex cases, and the implementation of the case man- agement system (CMS) in accordance with the internal data protection rules and the installation of the secure network for internal communica- tion. The Council reiterated its invitation to Mem- ber States to take advantage as much as possible of the facilities offered by Eurojust for dealing with serious trans-border criminal cases and underlined the importance of the role of Eurojust as regards joint investigation teams and the Euro- pean arrest warrant. It expressed its satisfaction with Eurojust\u2019s commitment in the fight against terrorism and welcomed the appointment of national correspondents on terrorism by all Mem- ber States. However, it noted with regret that the effectiveness of Eurojust in the improvement of judicial cooperation appears to be weakened by the lack of implementation of a number of Euro- pean Union legislative instruments by all Mem- ber States. 1.19.18.

Endorsed by the European Parliament on 1 June, subject to certain amendments. In particular, adding that within the same Member State and across the European Union, the range of possible prohibitions arising from criminal convictions is broad and the nature and methods of applying those sanctions can vary considerably, so priority should be given to sectors where a common basis already exists between the Member States, and extending the definition of \u2018prohibition\u2019 in Arti- cle 2. 1.19.22. Council conclusions on European Union priorities in the fight against crime. Reference: Council conclusion on intelligence-led policing and the development of the organised crime threat assessment: Bull. 10-2005, point 1.4.21 Adopted on 2 June. On the basis of the Europol organised crime threat assessment, which attempts to develop a threat assessment of cur- rent and expected trends in organised crime across the European Union (EU), the Council set the Union\u2019s priorities in the fight against crime. In south-western Europe, attention should be paid to the smuggling and trafficking of human beings, smuggling of illegal immigrants as well as drug trafficking. The focus in south-eastern Europe should be on ethnic Albanian organised crime and its involvement both in heroin trafficking and dis- tribution, and in trafficking in human beings. In north-eastern Europe, the Union should focus on Russian-speaking organised crime groups involved in commodity smuggling. Activities in the Atlantic region should focus on the produc- tion of synthetic drugs and their ensuing distri- bution within the EU and via Germany and the United Kingdom across the Atlantic into the United States and Canada. The fight against money laundering and illicit arms trafficking should be included in all of these priorities. The Council concluded that the fight against orga- nised crime requires a multidisciplinary intelli- gence-led approach in order not only to disrupt criminal activities but also dismantle criminal organisations, bring the offenders to justice and deprive them of the proceeds of crime, thereby providing much more effective and longer-term results and reducing the harm caused by organ- ised crime. The Council stated that all relevant EU bodies, agencies, working groups should take account of these priorities and reflect them in their strategic planning, working programmes, budgets, annual reporting and external relations. Similarly, all relevant authorities in the Member States should take account of these strategic pri- orities when planning their individual and joint responses to the threats they face from organised crime. 1.19.23. Council conclusions on the future of Europol. Adopted on 2 June. After examining a report on the ways to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of Europol, the Council adopted the following five recommendations: finalise the ratification of three protocols amend- ing the Europol Convention; start the implemen- tation of the three protocols; improve the func- tioning of Europol both within the current legal framework of the Europol Convention and beyond the current legal framework by consider- ing long-term solutions which would require an amendment to the Convention; replace the Europol Convention by a Council decision by 1 January 2008 or as soon as possible thereafter, and finally, explore the method to abrogate the Europol Convention in case it is replaced by a Council decision. 1.19.24.

These proposals for Council decisions aim to conclude agreements concern- ing the participation of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The agreement states that Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey will take part in the centre\u2019s work pro- gramme, satisfy the obligations of Council Reg- ulation (EEC) No 302/93 and be linked to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (Reitox). All three states will share data with the centre, subject to data pro- tection requirements of the Community and national laws, contribute financially to cover the cost of its participation, as well as participate in the management board of the centre without the right to vote until they become members of the European Union. The notable benefits of the agreement are as follows: participation in the cen- tre will assist Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey in adopting and implementing the acquis concerning drugs in preparation for accession; the three states will become more familiar with decision-making procedures of the centre; the centre will be able to extend its reporting on the state of drug use and addiction to include all three states, and finally, participation will enable their inclusion in the early warning system on new synthetic drugs.

The object of this Green Paper is to explore the scope for bringing those most directly concerned by the drugs problem more closely into the policy process on drugs at the European Union (EU) level. It launches a wide-ranging consultation on how to organise a structured and continuous dialogue on the issue between the Commission and civil society. It also seeks ways of adding value through constructive advice with a view to placing the specific knowl- edge of civil society at the disposal of the poli- cymaking process at EU level in a practical and sustainable form. The principal objective at this stage is to realise such input in relation to the EU action plan on drugs. COM(2006) 316 1.19.28.

The Commission fleshed out its plan for the establishment of a European Insti- tute of Technology (EIT) and prepared the for- mal proposal expected towards the end of the year. The Commission presented the results so far of the consultation process which has led to a clarification of the proposed structure and func- tioning of the institute. A governing board with a light support structure (administration, legal ser- vice, etc.) will identify strategic scientific chal- lenges in interdisciplinary areas (perhaps, for example, green energy or nanotechnologies) and will, on a competitive basis, select and support \u2018knowledge communities\u2019 to carry out the tasks related to research, education and innovation in these areas. With an autonomous organisation able to set its own strategic agenda, the EIT itself must have a strong identity and be able to pool and integrate existing top-class teams from uni- versities and research institutes across Europe. Finally, the Commission recalled that this insti- tute is complementary to other European Union (EU) actions strengthening innovation in Europe, which include the seventh framework programme with the European Research Council, the Euro- pean technology platforms and joint technology initiatives, and the lifelong learning programme.

Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Euro- pean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \u2018Towards a future maritime policy for the Union: a European vision for the oceans and seas (Green Paper)\u2019. Adopted on 7 June. The Commission launched one of the largest consultation exercises in the European Union (EU)\u2019s history, asking citizens how they want to deal with oceans and seas. The initiative responds to a growing awareness both of the vital role which the sea already plays as a driver of Europe\u2019s prosperity, and of its potential for providing more jobs and greater well-being. The results of this exercise will help the Com- mission define a new vision for an integrated maritime policy. The main question asked by the Green Paper is: can Europe afford to manage its seas and oceans in a sectoral, unconnected, way? Or has the time come to establish a truly inte- grated maritime policy which will release untapped potential in terms of growth and jobs while strengthening the protection of the marine environment? And if so, how should we go about it? The Green Paper seeks to highlight the inter- connections and interdependence of these differ- ent domains \u2014 the linkages which are often ignored by existing procedures. It points out how, for example, the development of port infrastruc- ture has to be weighed against the protection of local ecosystems, the promotion of coastal aqua- culture and tourism development, as well as the benefits of economic growth through foreign trade. It shows how fishing vessels, container ships, pleasure boats, oil companies and wind farms, for example, have to jostle for position in our increasingly crowded waters. It also under- lines the fact that this convergence of different myriad issues is not the exception, but the norm, for it reflects the underlying wealth and diversity of Europe\u2019s seas.

It also considered that while intellectual property rights do not have to consti- tute an obstacle to information provision, addi- tional conditions can nevertheless be established (for example the licence click). Parliament rein- troduced the amendments contained in its first reading, such as those concerning intellectual property rights which have to be abolished from the list of exceptions intended to restrict access to ",
        "Environment Bull. EU 6-2006 83 information on the environment. Thus, Parliament considered that \u2018Member States propose, free of charge, at least search and consultation of sets of geographical data\u2019. According to the Parliament, free and free of charge access has to be guaran- teed not only to the services which make a search, but also to those which consult the data. Moreover, Parliament recommended taking account of the aspect of costs which \u2018do not have to exceed the cost of collection, of production, of reproduction and of dissemination\u2019, but are opposed to analyses without end and to additional conditions of feasibility.

The Council welcomed the Commission\u2019s communication on the thematic strategy on the urban environment. It recom- mended the integrated approach of the thematic strategy for cities and their policies in order to achieve a reduction of environmental and health burdens and better environmental quality in urban areas. The Council also welcomed the approach of the thematic strategy highlighting the impor- tance of public participation in decision-making and the role that existing voluntary initiatives can play. It invited the Commission to provide sup- port and impetus for public participation. Fur- thermore, the Council emphasised that noise, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are envi- ronmental problems in Europe\u2019s cities which especially affect the most vulnerable groups of society, in particular children, and stressed that transport is a major source of air and noise pol- lution, which have negative impacts on human health in cities. Efforts must then be taken to make urban transport sustainable for environment and health. Thus the Council recommended that Member States and cities improve environment- friendly transport connections and infrastructure links between the cities and their hinterlands by rail, bus and regional public transport within the scope of their sustainable urban transport plans. Moreover, it recommended an interregional and intersectoral approach in particular to coordinat- ing transport, urban and regional planning poli- cies involving cities and hinterland authorities, in order to combat urban sprawl and promote regional and cross-border cooperation between cities and their hinterland, including leisure and tourist destinations. It welcomed the promotion of exchanges of good practice and demonstration projects on urban issues and called on Member States and cities to implement and facilitate the thematic strategy on the urban environment and its proposed areas for action, in particular the environmental management and sustainable trans- port plans. Finally the Council recommended that synergies and cooperation with international activities in the field of the urban environment should be aimed at. Sustainable development Follow-up of the sustainable development strategy 1.21.5. European Parliament resolution on the revised sustainable development strategy.

Parliament regarded the pro- posal presented last December by the European Commission as deserving a renewal of the com- mitment made in 2001 by the European Council of Gothenburg but considered that the 2005\u201310 strategy concentrated too much on economic growth to the detriment of the environmental and social pillars. Parliament highlighted the impor- tance of placing the three pillars of sustainable development on the same footing, as well as the urgent need for better coordination between this sustainable development strategy and Lisbon strategy. According to Parliament, sustainable ",
        "Environment 84 Bull. EU 6-2006 development should be considered more as an economic opportunity and a spur to technological innovation and investment. It called for \u2018smart growth\u2019, notably via the indispensable transfor- mation of systems for providing energy and trans- port, which is both a key objective in the Euro- pean programme for fighting against climate change and a factor for stimulating growth and exports in the Lisbon strategy.

The text proposed by Par- liament aims to harmonise the methods of meas- urement of potential pollutants but does not necessitate single standards for all of the coun- tries (exceptions: nitrates and pesticides). Parlia- ment wished the future directive to specify that it will not stand against Member States preserving or introducing stricter protective measures. Vari- ous other amendments strengthen requirements of the text, specify sampling methodologies and eliminate some inaccuracies. Moreover, Parlia- ment wished to widen the scope of the directive by a definition of the deterioration concept, that is to say, according to the Parliament, any light and sustainable increase in the concentration of pollutants resulting from anthropic factors in rela- tion to a status quo in groundwaters. In addition, Parliament suggested that specific aid should be envisaged, whenever standards on nitrates and pesticides will change farming practices, via rural development plans drawn up within the frame- work of the common agricultural policy. More- over, Parliament introduced common methodol- ogy for the protection of thermal and medicinal water, and strengthened various requirements to ensure, in particular, that all the collecting sheets of drinking water are well and truly protected by the future directive when industrial and urban activities are planned. Lastly, Parliament expressed the wish that the directive be the sub- ject of an overall evaluation of effectiveness by 2015 at the latest. Soil conservation, agriculture 1.21.7.

Favourable. Adoption by the Council of a decision on con- clusion, on 27 June. The protocol on soil protec- tion is aimed in particular at safeguarding the multifunctional role of soil based on the concept of sustainable development. The Council under- lined that sustainable productivity of soil must be ensured in its natural function, as an archive for natural and cultural history and in order to guar- antee its use for agriculture and forestry, urban- ism and tourism, other economic uses, transport and infrastructure, and as a source of raw mate- rials. The contracting parties of the protocol on energy agree to take the appropriate measures in ",

Commission communication: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2005) 666; Bull. 12-2005, point 1.4.47 Adopted on 14 June. The Committee argued that the waste hierarchy should be made more bind- ing with lifecycle studies subject to an approval procedure. It declared itself against the use of comitology to set end of waste criteria and to specify the distinction between recovery and dis- posal and proposed instead a separate regula- tion/directive on this. The Committee asked for overall waste prevention targets in addition to the waste prevention programmes suggested by the Commission. Finally it supported the concrete actions aimed at introducing common standards for permits and registration where necessary. 1.21.12. Council conclusions on waste.

The Council welcomed the Commission\u2019s communication on a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste and highlighted the close linkage between the thematic strategy and other related strategies \u00a1 On the objectives of the European Union (EU) policy on waste, the Council stressed the substantial aim for waste management of achiev- ing a high level of protection of the environment and human health and that waste policy has to take all environmental impacts into account including those which occur out of the EU. It underlined the importance of the general prin- ciples of waste management, such as the precau- tionary principle, the polluter pays principle, the principle of waste generator\u2019s responsibility and, for specific waste flows, the principle of producer responsibility. It emphasised the key importance of waste hierarchy: prevention; re-use; recycling; other recovery operations, for example recovery operations with energy recovery; and disposal as a general rule of waste management and the use- fulness of an approach of the lifecycle to solve cases where a deviation of the hierarchy is envi- ronmentally justified. It supported the EU\u2019s long- term vision of becoming a \u2018European recycling society\u2019 and therefore asked the Commission to give particular consideration, in the context of the final evaluation of the sixth environment action programme, to the need for realistic long, medium and short-term targets and measures to achieve the overall vision of the EU of becoming a \u2018recycling society\u2019. \u00a1 Concerning the actions to be taken, the Council supported the Commission\u2019s approach to modernising the existing legal framework by clar- ifying, simplifying and streamlining the EU waste ",
        "Environment 86 Bull. EU 6-2006 law with the aim of better regulation. It called on the Commission to ensure that its major propos- als are fully assessed in terms of their economic, social and environmental costs and benefits and their impact on levels of waste recycling and recovery activities in the EU. It acknowledged the Commission proposal for the revision of Directive 2006/12/EC on waste and called on the Commission to clarify and harmonise correspon- ding definitions in future proposals of waste management legislation with the definitions con- tained in the revised directive on waste. The Council called on the Commission to come for- ward with concrete measures on prevention of waste in the fields of product policy, chemicals policy and eco-design to minimise both the gen- eration of waste and the presence of hazardous substances in waste and to develop guidelines for waste prevention. Finally, it underlined the importance of achieving common minimum stan- dards for recovery and recycling where justified at EU level and recognised the need for closer EU cooperation in case of trans-boundary waste management problems. Climate change International dimension 1.21.13. Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as regards the base year for the allocation of quotas of hydrochlorofluorocarbons with respect to the Member States that acceded on 1 May 2004. Regulation to be amended: Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council on substances that deplete the ozone layer: OJ L 244, 29.9.2000; Bull. 6-2000, point 1.4.38 Commission proposal: OJ C 14, 20.1.2005; COM(2004) 550; Bull. 7/8-2004, point 1.3.34 European Economic and Social Committee opinion: Bull. 3-2006, point 1.21.8 Endorsed by Parliament (first reading): Bull. 4- 2006, point 1.21.9 Council approval on 27 June. Purpose: to amend the base date in Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 for determining the allocation of quotas of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to producers and importers in the EU-25 with respect only to the 10 new Member States that acceded the Euro- pean Union on the 1 May 2004. Civil protection, environmental accidents 1.21.14. Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of floods. Reference: Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a frame- work for Community action in the field of water policy: OJ L 327, 22.12.2000; Bull. 9-2000, point 1.4.32, amended by Decision No 2455/2001/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council estab- lishing the list of priority substances in the field of water policy and amending Directive 2000/60/EC: OJ L 331, 15.12.2001; Bull. 11-2001, point 1.4.42 Commission proposal: OJ C 67, 18.3.2006; COM(2006) 15; Bull. 1/2-2006, point 1.20.19 European Economic and Social Committee opinion: Bull. 5-2006, point 1.21.9 Endorsed by Parliament (first reading) on 13 June. Parliament approved the Commission proposal but stated that any policy based on a national approach to the management of floods is not sufficient. Thus, Parliament called on cross- border states to coordinate their actions in the evaluation and the management of risks related to floods. However Parliament left Member States the possibility of developing specific meas- ures for certain areas for environmental reasons. Moreover, Parliament asked that the subsidiarity principle be respected at the time of the evalua- tion of risk areas. Member States should, at the level of the hydrographic district, prepare maps of easily flooded areas and of indicative risks of damage likely to be caused by floods. The aim of this amendment is that these maps will be used to phase out direct or indirect subsidies, which means increasing the risks of flood. In addition, Parliament asked that plans of management of flood risk take account of the proximity of poten- tially polluting facilities and function with processes which are natural, such as the mainte- nance and/or restoration of flood plains, in order to restore space for rivers. Some amendments are also introduced by Parliament in terms of the text. It replaced Commission formulations such as \u2018prevention of the risks\u2019 by \u2018protection level\u2019. Moreover, Parliament wished Member States to ",
        "Environment Bull. EU 6-2006 87 cooperate closely with local and regional author- ities in the prevention of risks. Parliament also indicated that information campaigns should be carried out in the Member States, in order that civil society is informed of risks and prepared to cope in a coordinated way. Lastly, Parliament wished risks to human health \u2014 in particular in the event of contamination of water \u2014 to be taken into account. Council agreement on 27 June. Concerning the main issues yet to be solved, the Council decided: that the scope of the directive would be wide, covering both international and national river basins; to require that the preliminary flood risk assessment would be completed by 22 December 2012; to require the revision and updating of the flood hazard maps and of the flood risk maps by 22 December 2019 and revision of plans in 2021 and every six years from then on.

COM(2006) 284 1.22.2. Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled \u2018Keep Europe moving \u2014 Sustainable mobility for our continent \u2014 Mid-term review of the European Commission\u2019s 2001 transport White Paper\u2019. Reference: Commission White Paper \u2018European transport policy for 2010: time to decide\u2019: COM(2001) 370; Bull. 9-2001, point 1.4.43 Adopted on 22 June. The Commission proposed a series of actions in all areas between 2006 and 2010. In its 2001 White Paper, the Commission opted for a very ambitious approach favouring intermodal transport and laying great importance on the revitalisation of the rail sector to counter the growth in road transport. The Commission in this communication said that its objectives have not changed since 2001: giving European citizens efficient, sustainable and sure forms of transport which respect the environment, guarantee a high level of mobility and put transport policy \u2018at the heart of the Lisbon agenda\u2019. However the Com- mission specified that the context has changed (European Union enlargement, competitive inter- national industrial environment, weak economic growth, environmental commitments, terrorism) and that the measures envisaged in 2001 will not be enough on their own to achieve its objectives and it is no longer sensible or possible for EU transport policy to be too prescriptive in relation to forms of transport or preferred technologies. The Commission indicated that the overall modal spread will remain quite stable and the hoped-for environmental gains of a general shift from road to rail will not materialise. In this context, accord- ing to the Commission, it would be better to make better use of the potential of each form of transport. Unlike the 2001 White Paper, which put forward 60 specific measures to be taken at Community level, this document proposes more general action favouring dialogue with all the partners spread over a suggested timetable: \u00a1 in 2006: internal market review; review of air transport liberalisation measures; strategy for the security of critical infrastructure; action plan for energy efficiency and roadmap for renewable energies; \u00a1 in 2007: Green Paper on urban transport; development of a European ports policy; imple- mentation of the \u2018Naiades\u2019 action plan for inland water transport; strategy on public transport safety; \u00a1 in 2008: White Paper on a common Euro- pean maritime area; \u00a1 in 2009: achievement of Community mem- bership of international organisations (including the International Maritime Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation); start of Galileo concession. The Commission underlined that, continuously, it will also be necessary to: assure the function- ing of EU rules in all modes of transport; pro- mote transport professions, training and dialogue between the social partners; promote road safety through vehicle design and technology, infra- structure and behaviour; encourage and coordi- nate funding for new infrastructure or for mod- ernising existing infrastructure; invest in research ",
        "Transport Bull. EU 6-2006 89 and development; develop external relations through bilateral agreements and deploy a com- mon aviation area in Europe; consolidate the European transport safety agencies and develop their tasks (the road sector is the only form of transport which does not have a European agency). In conclusion, the future European trans- port policy should optimise the potential of each mode of transport to attain the objectives of clean and effective transport systems set in 2001. For this, the Commission considered that one should count more on technology, logistics and innova- tion in order to make transport more environ- ment-friendly, in particular when it is a matter of greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission has not completely given up the objective of a modal shift but does not make it its priority and indi- cated that it is appropriate to obtain a shift of traf- fic towards more environmentally friendly means where necessary especially for long distances, in urban areas and on congested routes.

The Commission presented what constitutes the first step towards establish- ing a framework strategy for freight transport logistics. For the Commission, such a strategy should be market-oriented, environmentally sus- tainable, and include a social dimension with a win-win situation for all actors. The Commission underlined a number of areas of action without going into detail at this stage: to increase effi- ciency and uniformity in the field of information and communications technologies, in particular, through standardisation and RTD; to improve training and certification of transport logisticians and other personnel working with logistics flows; to identify and solve obstacles that hinder freight transport logistics from developing faster (\u2018bot- tleneck exercise\u2019); to devise methodologies and indicators for assessing Europe\u2019s logistics per- formance and recognising logistics excellence in transport and supply chains; to enhance the effi- ciency of logistics terminals; to advance unifor- mity in multimodal liability and related transport documents; and to promote multimodal transport solutions as part of Europe\u2019s transport system.

It sup- ported the Commission\u2019s recommendations con- cerning the co-financing of the deployment of the system and recognised the importance to equip with the new system, as a priority, six rail corri- dors identified by the European coordinator Mr Karel Vinck: Rotterdam\u2013Genoa, Naples\u2013 Berlin\u2013Stockholm, Antwerp\u2013Basel/Lyon, Seville\u2013 Lyon\u2013Turin\u2013Trieste\u2013Ljubljana, Dresden\u2013Prague\u2013 Brno\u2013Vienna\u2013Budapest and Duisburg\u2013Berlin\u2013 Warsaw. Parliament believed that the success of ERTMS will depend on fitting the system throughout these corridors in order to avoid the emergence of a multitude of ERTMS \u2018islands\u2019 separated by old national systems. It also believed the strategy of migration from old rail signalling systems to ERTMS should be set out in binding \u2018master plans\u2019. Opening up road transport 1.22.6.

The Committee asked to modify the Commission\u2019s proposal from an obligation to acquire clean vehicles and to transform it into a recommendation and called on the Council and Parliament to take, within the framework of the continuation of the work aiming to promote clean road transport, measures directed towards the pri- vate sector. It considered that economic aid has to be granted to local and regional authorities to ",
        "Transport Bull. EU 6-2006 91 enable them to implement the directive. More- over, it stressed that it is important to agree on investments in information and undergoing train- ing in order to encourage and develop public con- tracts of clean vehicles from the public sector. The Council sought an overall vision of meas- ures, which can be taken with a view to promot- ing the clean road freight vehicles, and proposed the adoption of a system of reports intended for monitoring the directive on the promotion of clean road freight vehicles, coordinated to other existing report systems. According to the Com- mittee, it is advisable, in particular, to envisage cooperation with the report system, which appears in the proposal for a directive on ambi- ent air quality and cleaner air for Europe, and starts from the principle that municipalities and regions have to be involved in the continuation of the development task, implementation, of mon- itoring and of evaluation of measures proposed in the directive.

Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament under Article 138(2) of the European Community (EC) Treaty on the strengthening of maritime labour standards; proposal for a Council decision on authorising Member States to ratify, in the inter- ests of the European Community, the 2006 Con- solidated Maritime Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation. Adopted on 15 June. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) consolidated convention, adopted on 23 February 2006, sets minimum stan- dards on conditions of employment, requirements for seafarers to work on a ship encompassing health, safety, minimum age, recruitment, work- ing hours, accommodation, social protection to secure decent working and living conditions on board. Provisions on compliance and enforcement are also foreseen to define the mutual responsi- bilities of states and operators in the implementa- tion of the convention. This ILO convention should help to stabilise the maritime transport sec- tor in the face of growing global competition between the various flag states and favouring the maritime countries with the least stringent social legislation. It should create fairer competition con- ditions for companies whose ships fly European flags while contributing to limit competitiveness gaps resulting from social costs but also improv- ing maritime safety and promoting the maritime profession. The entry into force of the convention is subject to the ratification of the convention by 30 states representing 33% of world tonnage. The bulk of the convention\u2019s provisions refer to mat- ters falling within shared competences between the Community and the Member States but some matters fall within exclusive competences, such as the coordination of social protection regimes. Since only Member States can be part of the con- vention, the Commission believes that the Coun- cil should authorise the Member States, which are bound by Community rules adopted in virtue of exclusive competence in social security based on Article 42 of the Treaty, to ratify the convention in the interests of the Community. In addition, the Commission intends to reflect on the implemen- tation of the convention at community level. This communication on the strengthening of the mar- itime labour standards constitutes the first con- sultation phase of social partners foreseen in Arti- cle 138, paragraph 2 of the Treaty. The two questions submitted to them are the following: ",

COM(2006) 351 Safety and security of transport supply systems Road safety 1.22.14. Council conclusions on road safety. Adopted at its session of 8 and 9 June. The Coun- cil called on the Commission to take the neces- sary actions, including, where appropriate, leg- islative proposals to improve road safety within the European Union (EU), by identifying differ- ent areas such as: vulnerable road users; the safety of road infrastructure; cross-border enforcement of offences, with a particular focus on driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and speeding. The Council also insisted on the need to organise a European awareness-raising campaign to combat accident risks, to commit non-governmental stakeholders to additional road safety measures through the European Road Safety Charter, and to raise awareness among road users of possible risks, through the Com- mission\u2019s initiative for a road safety day.

The Committee supported all the pro- posals presented by the Commission in November 2005 known as the \u2018Erika III package\u2019on maritime safety. According to the Committee, the package should significantly increase the safety of maritime transport, but it underlined an area of concern: the administrative burden liable to be generated by the measures outlined in the seven legislative propos- als contained in the package. Among these pro- posals, the Committee recommended to harmonise programmes and requirements in the European Union (EU) with regard to training in the maritime sector and indicated that an initiative should be pursued in the context of mutual recognition of aptitude diplomas. The Committee also called for all ships using EU ports to be inspected at least once a year but it specified that no vessel should be controlled more than once a year unless there are specific circumstances justifying more frequent checks. The Committee believed no vessel should be authorised to delay correcting any anomalies identified during inspections or to proceed to another port on the basis of a mere promise to rem- edy shortcomings. Any failings should be cor- rected before the port state authorises the vessel to set sail for its next port of call. Aviation safety and security 1.22.16.

Subject to various amendments. Parlia- ment called for strict rules concerning safety agents present on commercial flights. Thus, it indicated that weapons could not be transported on board an aircraft, except if necessary condi- tions of safety were met and if the Member State which delivered the operating licence gave its authorisation. Moreover, Parliament asked for prior authorisation, i.e. given by the Member State of departure, the Member State of arrival and, if necessary, by any state flown over or on the territory of which stopovers are carried out. Furthermore, Parliament recommended that trav- ellers whose behaviour is obviously abnormal and threatens the safety of the flight be liable to appropriate safety measures during the way. Par- liament stressed that taxes and fees of safety have only to be used to cover the costs related to safety in the airports or on the aircraft. So, to avoid any market disruption, Parliament called on the Commission to propose a uniform system of financing of safety measures in the airports.

The Coun- cil stressed that secure supplies of electricity and gas at competitive prices, delivered on open, transparent and competitive interconnected mar- kets, with adequate protection of final consumers, are crucial to Europe\u2019s competitiveness. It indi- cated that the right balance should be found among the three objectives of competitive mar- kets, security of supply and sustainability, taking national circumstances into account. For the Council, full, effective and transparent imple- mentation and consistent application of existing legislation not just according to its letter but equally its spirit, has to be ensured. Furthermore, the Council reiterated that a coherent and inte- grated approach towards a competitive energy policy and competitive energy markets should be created by the regulatory framework as well as oversight by regulatory authorities and competi- tion authorities. The Council underlined that enhanced cooperation and coordination have to be ensured. The national regulatory authorities, relevant state administration bodies and competi- tion authorities have to play, according to the Council, an increasingly important role in deliv- ering liberalised energy markets across the Euro- pean Union. Moreover, for the Council, fair and non-discriminatory access to the network for all system users is essential if competition is to develop. It also stressed that: transparency of energy markets, for both operators and final consumers, has to be ensured; cross-border exchange of energy should be improved; and cross-border exchanges with third countries should be enhanced.

For Parliament, energy effi- ciency could provide the most significant, rapid and the least expensive answer to problems of security of energy supply, of rise in prices and of the environment. Parliament put emphasis on the search and stated that \u2018the European Union (EU) could save at least 20% of its current energy con- sumption and in a profitable way\u2019. To this end, it is essential, according to the Parliament, to carry out a national, regional, local and international operation at the Community level. Moreover, it considered that energy efficiency should be incor- porated into Community transport, foreign affairs and agriculture policies. Parliament proposed, among other things: the creation of a fund to pro- mote products encouraging energy efficiency; new tax measures; the extension of the label of energy efficiency and of other vectors of con- sumer\u2019s information; a European initiative to coordinate the update of the energy standards relating to new buildings; incentives to invest- ment in measures of energy efficiency; the replacement of old domestic equipment. In the opinion of Parliament, Member States, just as European institutions, should set an example by taking measures intended to promote energy sav- ing in the public sector, which involves a calling into question of the multiplicity of workplaces of the European Parliament itself. In addition, it stressed that Member States are struggling to implement Community legislation. It underlined also that numerous measures are already applied in this area and in particular directives on build- ing, combined electricity and heat production, eco-design, emission rights exchange and energy efficiency at the stage of the end-user. If this Community legislative arsenal was fully applied by Member States, the EU would already have progressed half of the way to be travelled to achieve the objective of saving 20% of its con- sumption between now and 2020. It therefore called on the Commission to accelerate the pro- cedures brought against Member States which have not yet complied with this legislation. Lastly, for Parliament, the consumer has to be informed in a clear and suitable way. The Parlia- ment therefore recommended a European infor- mation and awareness-raising campaign on best practices as regards energy efficiency. Renewable energy sources 1.23.5.

The Coun- cil underlined that the use of biomass as an energy source should be increased and declared itself convinced that its use can contribute to the three main objectives of energy policy by enhanc- ing security of supply and competitiveness and promoting environmental sustainability. It saw as priorities: research, development and demonstra- tion on biomass; promoting the creation of a well functioning, transparent and open market for bio- mass at regional, European Union (EU) and global level; the removal of technical and non- technical barriers at EU and national level. The council emphasised the importance of promoting the cost-efficient and sustainable use of biomass. Thus it invited the Commission to provide infor- mation about all costs and benefits of the pro- motion of biomass production within the EU and to establish efficiency and emission criteria for biomass installations.

Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners and Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs. Directives to be amended: Council Directive 95/2/EC (OJ L 61, 18.3.1995; Bull. 1/2-1995, point 1.3.8), as last amended by Directive 2003/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 24, 29.1.2004; Bull. 12- 2003, point 1.4.90 Directive 94/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 237, 10.9.1994; Bull. 6- 1994, point 1.2.28), as last amended by Directive 2003/115/EC: OJ L 24, 29.1.2004; Bull. 12-2003, point 1.4.91 Commission proposal: OJ C 24, 29.1.2005; COM(2004) 650; Bull. 10-2004, point 1.4.56 European Economic and Social Committee opinion: OJ C 255, 14.10.2005; Bull. 4-2005, point 1.4.68 European Parliament opinion (first reading): Bull. 10-2005, point 1.4.68 Approved by the Council at its session of 1 and 2 June. Now approved by both institutions, the proposed directive established new rules con- cerning the presence of nitrates in meat products, and authorises seven new additives while banning dangerous gelling agents. Changes proposed out- line stricter provisions for nitrates and nitrites in meat-based products. Thus, the level of nitrosamines (formed from nitrates and nitrites) will be kept as low as possible by lowering the levels of nitrites and nitrates added to food. Spe- cific provisions are however provided for some traditional meat products, which rely on certain technological processes and would disappear from the market if forced to comply with the general provisions. The amended legislation also autho- rises seven new additives: erythritol, soybean hemicellulose, ethyl cellulose, hexylresorcinol, tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), pullulan and starch aluminium octenyl succinate. The proposed directive will also make official the ban on using certain gelling agents in jelly mini cups which have been identified as a choking risk. 1.24.2. Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms (cod- ified version) ( \u2192 point 1.21.16). Animal health 1.24.3. Proposal for a Council decision laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases. Decision to be codified: Council Decision 90/638/EEC laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases: OJ L 347, 12.12.1990 Adopted on 20 June. The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Deci- sion 90/638/EEC. The new decision will super- sede the various acts incorpored in it; their con- tent is fully preserved, and they are bought together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. COM(2006) 315 1.24.4. Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council correcting Direc- tive 2002/2/EC amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs. Directive to be modified: Directive 2002/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repeal- ing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC: OJ L 63, 6.3.2002; Bull. 1/2-2002, point 1.4.109 Adopted on 27 June. Directive 2002/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ",
        "Health and consumer protection Bull. EU 6-2006 99 amended Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs, as regards labelling provisions. This amendment involved, among other things, the introduction, through Article 1(1)(b) of the directive, of the obligation for a manufacturer of compound feed- ingstuffs to indicate, at a customer\u2019s request, the exact percentages by weight of the feed materi- als used in the compound feedingstuffs. The Court of Justice of the European Communities later found this provision to be invalid in the light of the principle of proportionality in its judgment adopted on 6 December. In accordance with Article 233 of the EC Treaty, laying down that institutions whose act has been declared void are required to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice, the Commission proposes to correct Directive 2002/2/EC through a decision deleting the invalid provision, i.e. Article 1(1)(b) of the directive. COM(2006) 340 Animal welfare 1.24.5. Proposal for a Council decision amend- ing Decision 90/424/EEC in the veterinary field. Reference: Council Decision 90/638/EEC laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases: OJ L 347, 12.12.1990 Decision to be amended: Council Decision 90/424/EEC: OJ L 224, 18.8.1990 Adopted by the Commission 6 June. The pro- posal for amending Decision 90/424/EEC is lim- ited to three specific topics that need to be updated without delay to allow the Commission and the Member States to carry out in an effi- cient way their respective tasks regarding: firstly, the decision in order to allow the financing of multiannual eradication, control and monitoring programmes for animal diseases and zoonoses, and the simplification of the financing proce- dures and of the procedures for the approval of the programmes; secondly, the update of the decision in order to take into account the fact that the ANIMO system has been technically adjusted and integrated into the new integrated computerised (IT) veterinary system Traces (system for monitoring the movement of live animals and monitoring of imports into the European Union) and, thirdly, the amendments aimed at extending the scope of the information policy on animal protection to include all aspects of animal health and food safety in products of animal origin. COM(2006) 273 Plant health 1.24.6. Proposals for a Council directive amend- ing Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include azinphos-methyl, carbendazim, dinocap, fenari- mol, flusilazole, methamidophos, procymidone, and vinclozolin as active substances. Directive to be amended: Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant pro- tection products on the market (OJ L 230, 19.8.1991; Bull. 7/8-1991, point 1.2.203), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/81/EC: OJ L 276, 12.10.2002 Adopted on 13 June. These draft proposals con- cern the inclusion under strict conditions of cer- tain active substances in the positive list of Coun- cil Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. Active substances to be used as plant protection prod- ucts are assessed and authorised at Community level and are listed in Annex I to the directive. Individual plant protection products containing active substances are assessed and authorised by Member States under harmonised rules. In view of the hazardous profile of the substances, the conditions of inclusion provide restrictions to those crops that have effectively been considered during the Community evaluation and for which acceptable use may be expected, provided highly prescriptive risk mitigation measures are applied.

The Council welcomed the Commission communi- cation. It stressed that cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death, as well as of reduction in quality of life, in women in the European Union, although in some Member States it is still perceived as mainly a man\u2019s dis- ease. It also expressed its concern at the rise, in some Member States, in the number of women who smoke, as smoking increases the risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. Similar concerns will be expressed at the rise in the number of cases of depression, which is due to become the main cause of illness among women in some Member States by 2020. The Council will call on Member States to: gather health data separately for each gender and analyse the statistics according to gender; take initiatives to make the public and health pro- fessionals more aware of the link between gen- der and health; promote health and prevent ill- ness, taking account, if necessary, of the differences between genders; promote research on the effects of medicines on women and on men separately; encourage the incorporation of issues linked to gender specificities in health- care; take measures to ensure equality of treat- ment and access to care. The Commission will also be asked, in particular, to: apply the dif- ferences between men and women into health research; encourage and strengthen compara- bility and compatibility of information on health specific to one gender or the other in all Member States and at Community level; present a second report on the state of women\u2019s health in the EU. 1.24.8.

The Coun- cil called on Member States to develop frame- work plans against diabetes and/or its main causes for a prevention policy based on convinc- ing data, early detection and care built on best practice and an assessment system with measur- able objectives. It also insisted on devising meas- ures to increase public awareness and for cost- effective, sustainable and evidence-based primary prevention measures, which are accessible and respond to the needs both of those most at risk from diabetes and of the population at large. The Commission will also be called on to support Member States\u2019 efforts to prevent diabetes and promote a healthy lifestyle. 1.24.9. Council conclusions on common values and principles in European Union health systems. Reference: Amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council Euro- pean Parliament and Council directive on services in the internal market: COM(2006) 160; Bull. 4- 2006, point 1.10.2 Adopted at its session of 1 and 2 June. The Coun- cil noted that the Commission, in its amended pro- posal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal mar- ket, has decided to remove healthcare services from the scope of the directive, thereby incorporating amendments proposed by the European Parliament. It also noted that the Commission has stated that it will develop a Community framework for safe, high quality and efficient health services, by rein- forcing cooperation between Member States and providing clarity and certainty over the application of Community law to health services and health- care. Moreover, it recognised that recent judgments in the European Court of Justice have highlighted the need to clarify the interaction between the European Community Treaty provisions, particu- larly on the free movement of services, and the health services provided by national health sys- tems. Finally, it invited the Commission to ensure that the common values and principles contained in the statement are respected when drafting specific proposals concerning health services. 1.24.10. Council conclusions on the Beijing plat- form for action. References: Beijing World Conference on Women: Bull. 9- 1995, point 1.3.122 Beijing platform for action: Bull. 12-2004, point 1.3.31 Adopted at its session of 1 and 2 June. The Council considered that gender equality is a fun- damental principle of the European Union ",
        "Health and consumer protection Bull. EU 6-2006 101 enshrined in the European Community Treaty. According to it, the mainstreaming principle in all its activities represents a specific mission for the Community. Within the framework of imple- mentation at European level of the Beijing plat- form for action, the Council recalled the com- mitment taken by Member States to secure women\u2019s rights for the enjoyment of the highest standard of physical and mental health through- out the whole lifecycle in equality with men, and the lack of a gender perspective in health repre- sents an obstacle to achieving gender equality. It also recalled that Member States have com- mitted themselves to taking measures and devel- oping proper indicators and statistics in order to further implement the Beijing platform for action. Moreover, it stressed that the recognition of the gender dimension in health is an essential part of European Union health policies. It took note of the report on women\u2019s health presented by the Austrian Presidency and the three indica- tors for the future follow-up of the Beijing plat- form for action, namely: health life years, access to healthcare and cardiovascular diseases. Fur- thermore, the Council invited forthcoming Council Presidencies to take the necessary meas- ures to ensure a gender perspective in health policies and in the open method of coordination on health and long-term care. The Council undertook to continue its focus on the critical areas of concern mentioned in the Beijing plat- form for action and to review regularly the progress achieved. Finally, it called upon gov- ernments to determine the prerequisites for good health in both women and men, taking into account the specific aspects of women\u2019s health in order to establish an enabling environment for each sex. 1.24.11. Proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on medicinal products for pae- diatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regula- tion (EC) No 726/2004 ( \u2192 point 1.12.6).

This report summarised the measures taken by Members States to encourage voluntary unpaid donations and identified the measures the Commission intends to take in order to promote self-sufficiency in the European Community through voluntary unpaid donations. It reflected the fact that con- siderable efforts are already being taken by Member States to promote voluntary unpaid donations. Further measures intended to be taken at community level are a study under the Community health programme in order to determine best practices for promoting volun- tary and unpaid donations and the continuation of the discussion on self-sufficiency in the Community. COM(2006) 313 Action of information in the field of health 1.24.13. Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on actions for a safer Europe; proposal for a recom- mendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety. Reference: Decision No 1786/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003\u201308): OJ L 271, 9.10.2002; Bull. 9-2002, point 1.4.72 Adopted on 23 June. This communication focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries in the Member States by public health actions. It provides a strategic framework in the form of a Community action plan which will help the Member States prioritise their actions in reducing accidents and injuries. These actions shall be primarily undertaken in the framework of the Community public health programme (2003\u201308) and successor pro- grammes with the aim of reducing the number of accidents and injuries. In this communica- tion, the Commission highlights the role of the ",
        "Health and consumer protection 102 Bull. EU 6-2006 health sector in injury prevention by quanti- fying the problems, reporting risk factors, advo- cating primary prevention, disseminating evidence-based strategies, increasing the pro- fessional capacities for advising people at risk, leading national action plans and informing the public about hazards and safety precautions. As one essential part of the Community action plan, the Commission will improve the Com- munity database on accidents and injuries and will examine how regular statistics could be generated. The Commission will also take into account the experiences of third countries. Within the context of this action plan, the Commission will establish arrangements for a Community-wide sharing of information on prevention measures that have been proven to be successful. The key priority areas for pre- vention measures on injuries in the action plan are as follows: \u00a1 safety of children, \u00a1 safety of elderly citizens, \u00a1 safety of vulnerable road users, \u00a1 prevention of sports injuries, \u00a1 prevention of injuries caused by products and services, \u00a1 prevention of self-harm, \u00a1 prevention of interpersonal violence. The proposed Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety includes these objectives and proposes means to take them forward. On data collection, Mem- ber States are recommended to establish national surveillance systems, reporting to a Community system. Vocational training for health professionals is recommended as is exchange of best practice. Support for initia- tives through the public health programme is envisaged.

Parliament called on the Commission and Member States to increase their efforts, particularly to ensure the early warning system works properly, the immediate and effec- tive deployment of assistance and the availability of antiviral medicines for at least 25% of the pop- ulation. It evaluated that the Commission should within 24 hours be able to adopt crisis measures such as quarantine and disinfection measures at airports in connection with flights from certain regions and travel restrictions. Parliament also wants Member States to help increase the pro- duction capacity of vaccines against seasonal flu, so as to ensure a production of sufficient amounts of vaccine once the strain has been identified. It has also called for support for research on antivirals, vaccines and emerging diseases in gen- eral. It insisted on the need for closer coordination between Member States and the European Com- mission and on the importance of simulation exercises which also had to be conducted in the most remote regions. Consumer policy Consumers\u2019 economic and legal interests 1.24.15. Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of Directive 1998/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Reference: Directive 98/6/EC of the European Par- liament and of the Council on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers: OJ L 80, 18.3.1998; Bull. 1/2-1998, point 1.3.284 Adopted on 21 June. According to the Commis- sion, the directive did not give rise to any major ",
        "Health and consumer protection Bull. EU 6-2006 103 transposition problems in any of the Member States. It has been implemented by all Member States, though in some cases after the date set by Article 11(1) \u2014 that is 18 March 2000. The study carried out by the Commission shows a wide agreement that the directive has contributed to increase the protection of consumer economic interests, although the actual extent of its impact remains unclear. The directive allows Member States a remarkable level of discretion when drafting their transposition measures. Several arti- cles introduce open regulatory options for national legislators; as a result, national laws implementing the directive are in some aspects significantly diverging. This is not always the case, however. For some provisions, the vast majority of Member States have adopted the same normative solutions at national level. As a result of this discretion, Member States have not relied extensively on the minimum harmonisation clause in Article 10, whereby they can adopt or main- tain provisions which are more favourable as regards consumer information and comparison of prices than those contained in the directive. In the light of a possible revision of the directive, the Commission intends therefore to consider whether there is a need to maintain the minimum harmonisation clause in Article 10. As far as the possibility to waive the obligation to indicate the unit price of products for which this indication would not be useful because of their nature or purpose, the transposition checks reveal a very fragmented scenario: while some categories of products are exempted in most Member States, there are a number of quite specific exceptions, which are not always readily justifiable under the wording of Article 5(1). This creates an unwel- come inequality in the level of consumer protec- tion across Europe, which may require further guidance as to what products or categories of products may be subjected and/or exempted from the obligation to indicate the unit price. Finally, as mentioned above, the Commission intends to hear the view of the interested parties on the applica- tion of Article 6, with particular reference to its impact on the commercial activity of small retail businesses. The Commission welcomes particu- larly any submission on the continuing need for the temporary derogation provided in the directive and/or the opportunity to introduce a European definition of small retailers in the legislation.

Proposal for a Council decision on a Community position within the EC\u2013Turkey Cus- toms Cooperation Committee on the adoption of a decision laying down detailed rules for the application of Decision No 1/95 of the EC\u2013Turkey Association Council. Adopted on 1 June. Decision No 1/2001 of the EC\u2013Turkey Customs Cooperation Committee, of 28 March 2001, lays down detailed rules for the application of Decision No 1/95 of the EC\u2013Turkey Association Council. The Decision has to be amended to take account of enlargement and of recent developments in the Community customs legislation. It has also to be amended to enable the acceptance by Turkey of A.TR movement certifi- cates issued in the Community on the basis of sin- gle authorisations of approved exporters issued in a Member State other that those of actual export of the goods. Decision No 1/1999 of the EC\u2013Turkey Customs Cooperation Committee of 28 May 1999 lays down procedures to facilitate the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and the making out of invoice declarations under the provisions govern- ing preferential trade between the European Union, Turkey and certain European countries. Decision No 1/2000 of the EC\u2013Turkey Customs Cooperation Committee of 25 July 2000, on the acceptance, as proof of Community or Turkish origin, of move- ment certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations issued by certain countries that have signed a pref- erential agreement with the Community or Turkey. Both decisions ensure, for the products covered by the customs union, the necessary linkage between the free circulation within the customs union and the preferential relations of its two parts with their common trade partners. It is therefore appropriate to incorporate in the current decision the provisions currently laid down in Decisions No 1/1999 and No 1/2000 and to repeal them.

Relations with the western Balkans General 1.25.9. Council conclusions on the western Balkans. Adopted on 12 June . The Council reiterated that full cooperation with the ICTY is essential to achieve lasting reconciliation in the region and to lift a fundamental obstacle on the way towards the European Union (EU). In this context, the Council noted with concern that the Chief Pros- ecutor had not been able to report any progress on the arrest and transfer of the six remaining fugi- tives. The Council called on all countries con- cerned to take decisive action to ensure that all remaining fugitive indictees, notably Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, are finally brought to justice. The Council welcomed the signature of the stabilisation and association agreement and of the interim agreement with Albania as an important step on the country\u2019s path towards the EU. It looked forward to intensifying cooperation with Albania through the comprehensive frame- work offered by these agreements and the other mechanisms of the stabilisation and association process. The Council called on Albania to push ahead with its reform agenda and encouraged all political forces to unify their efforts to accelerate that process. The Council warmly welcomed the results of the Stability Pact\u2019s regional table meet- ing held in Belgrade on 30 May 2006. Underlin- ing the need for the region of south-eastern Europe to gradually take over ownership and responsibility, including financial, for regional cooperation, it welcomed the phased evolution of the Stability Pact into a more regionally owned, streamlined and effective regional cooperation framework in which the south-east European cooperation process, if successfully strengthened, should play a central part. The Council fully sup- ports the creation of a regional cooperation coun- cil to be operational by 2008. Montenegro 1.25.10. Council conclusions on Montenegro. Adopted on 12 June. The Council took note that, on 3 June 2006, based on Article 60 of the Con- stitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and following the Montenegrin referendum of 21 May 2006, the Parliament of Montenegro has passed a declaration on the inde- pendence of the Republic of Montenegro which states that the Republic of Montenegro is an inde- pendent state with full legal personality under international law. Furthermore, the Council has ",
        "Enlargement 106 Bull. EU 6-2006 taken note that, on 5 June 2006 following the aforementioned declaration, the Parliament of Serbia passed a decision that defines the Repub- lic of Serbia as the continuing state of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The Council recognises that these parliamentary acts were taken in conformity with the arrangements and procedures foreseen in the Belgrade agreement of 14 March 2002 as well as in compliance with Article 60 of the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The European Union and its Member States have therefore decided that they will develop further their relations with the Republic of Montenegro as a sovereign, independent state, taking full account of the referendum result and the afore- mentioned parliamentary acts. Member States will take the subsequent measures implementing this decision nationally in accordance with inter- national law and practice.

Bilateral relations Bosnia and Herzegovina 1.25.12. Council conclusions on the comprehen- sive review of the EU\u2019s activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Adopted on 12 June. The Council has under- taken a comprehensive review of the European Union (EU) activities in Bosnia and Herzegov- ina, including by conducting concurrent review processes of Operation Althea and the EU police mission (EUPM), which has helped ensure a more complete operational overview and a coherent approach to European security and defence policy (ESDP) actions such as in the support to the fight against organised crime. Within the framework of the comprehensive review, the Council reviewed Operation Althea and welcomed the positive contribution of the operation to ensuring a safe and secure envi- ronment in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Coun- cil confirmed that the European multinational stabilisation force (EUFOR) should maintain current force levels and its current tasks for the coming six months. The Council furthermore noted that cooperation with NATO continues to work well in the context of the Berlin Plus arrangements. The Council considered that a EUFOR presence would be required beyond the end of 2006. The Council also reviewed EUPM and welcomed the positive contribution of the ",

The Council recognised the important role of EUPM, in close coordination with the EC, in the area of police reform. The Council welcomed the extensive EU support to Bosnia and Herzegov- ina authorities in the fight against organised crime. In the broader framework of security sector reform in the western Balkans, the EU has substantially contributed to the build-up of local capacity. The Council reconfirmed EUPM\u2019s leading role in the coordination of policing aspects of ESDP efforts in the fight against organised crime in Bosnia and Herze- govina. The Council also welcomed the increased cooperation between the EU special representative (EUSR), EUFOR and EUPM in this regard. 1.25.13.

The Council has agreed to take further steps to ensure that the European Union (EU) can react more effectively and lend assistance when major emergencies occur inside or outside the Union. It endorsed the operational EU emer- gency and crisis coordination manual drawn up by the Presidency. This sets out, firstly, the internal arrangements for political coordination in Brussels for major emergencies inside or outside the Euro- pean Union which do not duplicate or supplant existing networks or rapid alert systems but instead help deliver a better coordinated EU response, and secondly, it identifies contact points in Member States, available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, which could be called upon in the event of coor- dinated terrorist attacks or an influenza pandemic. The Council invited Member States to put in place, where appropriate, the necessary internal structures to ensure that they are in a position to respond rap- idly to all requests for assistance in relation to all types of emergencies or crises. 1.26.9.

It proposed practical steps for the way ahead: better internal strategic planning thanks to an informal meeting at every new Presidency; better cooperation between the Commission and the Council Secretariat; and better relations with Member States with a personnel exchange programme involving the ",

The Council welcomed the release of the Commission communication \u2018A concept for European Community support for security sector reform\u2019. This concept comple- ments the concept for ESDP support to security sector reform, adopted in November 2005. Together, the two concepts constitute a policy framework for EU engagement in security sector reform (SSR), stressing the importance of taking a comprehensive and cross-pillar approach to SSR recognising the fact that SSR is a holistic, multi-sector, and long-term process encompass- ing the overall functioning of the security sys- tem as part of governance reforms. The EU action on SSR should be based on principles, drawing on the OECDDAC definition of SSR, like: nationally/regionally owned participatory reform processes designed to strengthen good governance, democratic norms, the rule of law and the respect and promotion of human rights; addressing the core requirements of a well func- tioning security system; addressing diverse secu- rity challenges facing states and their popula- tions, based on a gender-sensitive multi-sector approach to the provision of security and access to justice, and targeting reform needs in different key sectors. 1.26.17.

Parliament called on the states party to the United Nations Programme of Action Review Conference 2006 to agree a set of global prin- ciples on arms transfers, consistent with their existing responsibilities under international, regional and national laws, including a require- ment not to transfer weapons that are likely to contribute to human rights violations or crimes against humanity or that foster regional or national instability and armed conflict. It urged all states to incorporate United Nations General Assembly Resolution 34/169 and the basic principles on the use of force and firearms adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress in Cuba in 1990, into their national legislation. Parliament also strongly recommended that governments: prohibit the unauthorised civilian possession and use of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and automatic and semi- automatic rifles and machine guns; develop information and exchange programmes between states that wish to cooperate on issues relating to controlling civilian possession of SALW; address the issue of reducing the excessive and undesirable demand for SALW within society and therefore promote programmes and meas- ures aimed at reducing that demand, preventing and reducing urban or rural violence and inse- curity and focusing on groups that are specifi- cally affected by SALW violence.

Parliament considers it nec- essary to harmonise all existing definitions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including micro-enterprises, at least on a re- gional basis and came to the conclusion that the number of employees is the best criterion for defining a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). It supported policies aimed at reducing barriers to enterprise creation, registration and start-up and called on national governments in developing countries to evaluate the impact on SMEs of current and future economic legislation. Parliament recommended special support for the creation of networks of enterprises at local and regional levels and recognised the paramount role played by women in all development-related areas, a role too often forgotten by decision- makers, and demands that special attention be paid to enterprise projects started by women. It called for the progressive introduction of the concept of corporate social responsibility in SMEs from developing countries and asked the Commission to use all relevant conferences and bilateral discussions with countries which are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement to foster that introduction and awareness. Finally, Parlia- ment called for: policies facilitating access to credit; tax incentives to be given to SMEs; reg- ulatory reforms aimed at speeding up and sim- plifying registration procedures; the reform of court procedures to settle business disputes faster. 1.29.2.

Under the ninth European Development Fund (EDF) financial regulation, the schedule decided for this instalment is as follows: the Commission submits the proposal to the Council by 15 June 2006; the Council decides on this instalment within 21 calendar days following the Commis- sion\u2019s presentation of its proposal; the Member States pay the contributions due under this instal- ment within 21 calendar days of the date on which the Council\u2019s decision is notified to them. The ninth EDF financial regulation also stipulates that a Member State which fails to pay the instalment of contributions due by the deadline will be required to pay interest on the amount unpaid.

Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament \u2014 \u2018Annual report 2006 on the European Commu- nity\u2019s development policy and the implementa- tion of external assistance in 2005\u2019. Reference: Commission communication on the annual policy strategy for 2005: OJ C 98, 23.4.2004; COM(2004) 133; Bull. 1/2-2004, point 1.9.14 Previous report: OJ C 236, 24.9.2005; COM(2005) 292; Bull. 7/8-2005, point 1.6.33 Adopted on 22 June. In 2005, the European Union (EU) committed itself to double its current level of official development assistance (ODA) by 2010. In terms of delivery of development aid, 2005 was a record year for the European Com- mission: EUR 6.2 billion was spent \u2014 up from EUR 5.7 billion the previous year. Within this legal framework, the Commission set out in its annual policy strategy (APS) for 2005 specific objectives of particular relevance for development policy and external assistance. In 2005 it chose to focus on the following: the stabilisation and asso- ciation process in the Balkans; further imple- mentation of the European neighbourhood policy, particularly by means of action plans; creation of the four \u2018common spaces\u2019 with Russia; contribu- tion to the reconstruction of Iraq; review and scal- ing up of the EU contribution to the millennium development goals; making the peace facility for Africa operational; launch of an EU water facil- ity. To complete the APS objectives, the Com- mission had also planned to conclude and sign a revised Cotonou Agreement. This objective, together with the implementation of the peace facility and the emphasis on the millennium development goals (MDGs), reinforced the focus on Africa as the main priority for 2005. Besides this general record, the focal points in the year 2005 of EC aid and development policy centred on five main issues: the EU took firm commit- ments to accelerate progress towards achieving the MDGs, concentrating on: more and better aid, strengthened policy coherence for development and extra efforts in support of Africa; a new tri- partite development policy statement, the \u2018Euro- pean consensus on development\u2019, was endorsed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and complemented by an EU strat- egy for Africa; the EU developed further its part- nership approach; the political dimension of aid and external assistance has been fundamental; the Community has maintained in 2005 its require- ment for faster and better aid delivery.

Parliament considers that trade can help to create concrete opportunities for developing countries and, in particular, for least-developed countries, but that it can lead to the eradication of poverty and to the delivery of development only if accompanied by good-quality domestic policies. It recognised that the principle of freedom of movement for goods and services may be an effective way of helping poor countries to develop, on condition that their problems and interests are specifically taken into account. Parliament called on the Com- mission to consider as a priority in its interna- tional agenda the enforcement of trade rules and of the right to development, in particular envi- ronmental and social rules in order to contribute to the eradication of the root causes of poverty. It called for a full impact assessment of current trade policies on the environment, on sensitive sectors such as forestry and fisheries, and on poverty in the developing countries and in the EU and for an impact assessment of the increased costs which the customs protection and trade bar- riers of current European trade policies cause for European consumers and of the obstacles to development this involves for poor people in the developing countries of the world. Parliament also called on the European Union (EU) to take the lead in order to develop and help implement schemes to end the debt burden in order to meet the millennium development goals. Finally, it called on the Commission to work towards more ",

It reiterated the Euro- pean Union\u2019s firm commitment to contribute to the sustainable management of the world\u2019s forests and noted the need for action-oriented coopera- tion among countries, as well as effective partic- ipation of stakeholders in order to achieve sus- tainable forest management including the need for collaborative action to combat illegal logging, associated trade and corruption. The Council also acknowledged the great value of regional forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) processes co-organised by the World Bank, in order to address the complex and urgent issue of illegal logging, associated trade and corruption. Finally, it welcomed the outcome of the Europe and north Asia (ENA) FLEG ministerial confer- ence which took place in St. Petersburg from 22 to 25 November 2005, bringing together nearly 300 participants from 48 countries representing governments, the private sector, civil society and international organisations.

A separate enlargement protocol with Switzerland had to be adopted to allow the 10 new Member States to accede to the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other, on the free movement of persons. The enlarge- ment protocol is a mixed international agreement with the European Community and all its Mem- ber States as contracting parties. Therefore, it has to be drawn up and authenticated in all official languages of the European Union, as set out in Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958. As it appeared that the Maltese-language version of the enlarge- ment protocol would not be available for the scheduled date of signature on 26 October 2004, the negotiators suggested that the contracting parties should proceed with the signature of the enlargement protocol and authenticate the Maltese-language version at a later stage follow- ing the entry into force of the protocol.

The Com- mission and the Swiss federal government depart- ments reached an agreement on the content of the proposed exchange of letters, subject to legal ver- ification. With regard to the European Commu- nity, the exchange of letters authenticating the Maltese-language version constitutes an interna- tional agreement modifying the enlargement pro- tocol. As this protocol was concluded on the basis of Articles 310 and 300 of the EC Treaty, the exchange of letters has to follow the same pro- cedure. Council Decision No 2006/245/EC of 27 February 2006 approving the conclusion of the enlargement protocol does not provide for a simplified procedure for the exchange of letters. Accordingly, the assent of the European Parlia- ment is necessary, as the exchange of letters amends the enlargement protocol, which is based on Article 310 of the EC Treaty. With regard to ratification by the Member States, however, the simplified procedure provided for in Article 6(2) of the Act of Accession can be used.

The Commission, in close cooperation with the Council has held exploratory talks with Egypt which have resulted in an agree- ment on a draft action plan, which covers a time frame of three to six years. Its implementation is expected to help fulfil the provisions in the asso- ciation agreement and contribute to an increas- ingly close relationship with Egypt, involving a significant degree of economic integration and a deepening of political cooperation. The action plan is a broad tool for economic and political cooperation, carrying to a further stage the com- mitments and objectives contained in the Euro- Mediterranean association agreement.

EU 6-2006 125 Ms Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commis- sion, and, on the Egyptian side, Ahmad Abul- geith, Foreign Minister, and Rachid Mohamed Rachid, External Trade Minister. The European Union (EU) expressed its disappointment at the fact that the European neighbourhood policy action plan has not yet been finalised and its hope that negotiations will achieve a result in coming weeks. The Union called on Egypt to make an effort to speed up political and economic reforms, promote peace and stability in the Middle East and combat common security threats. It recalled its concern regarding the severity and the dispro- portionate nature of the treatment inflicted on peaceful demonstrators in Cairo, supporting Egyptian judges who criticised the unfolding of legislative elections in 2005 and expressed con- cern about allegations of torture and failure to respect minority, religious, sexual and women\u2019s rights. At the economic level, the EU welcomed Egypt\u2019s recent remarkable economic reforms, its strengthened monetary stability and economic growth and called for these to be consolidated to ensure they have a lasting effect. Egypt under- lined the right of their country to conduct reform at its own pace without outside interference within respect of national constraints as well as affirming the need to promote in-depth cultural dialogue. 1.33.6.

Parliament expressed its seri- ous concern over the deterioration of the human- itarian, economic and financial situation in the West Bank and Gaza, and called on the Council and Commission to strengthen their initiatives. It recommended that they act within the Quartet with the aim of urgently guaranteeing the flow of aid essential to the Palestinians through humani- tarian agencies and NGOs, thus avoiding a major humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories. Parliament called on the Israeli government to immediately resume the direct transfer of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues which have been blocked since January 2006, and urged the Commission to ensure that Israel meets its obligations towards the Palestinian Authority that are outlined in the EU\u2013Israel action plan. It reiterated its condemnation of the continuing extension of settlements, in particular in East Jerusalem, and the building of the wall beyond the 1967 borders. Parliament expressed its sup- port for the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s initiative to promote national dialogue and its hope that the proposals will be accepted by all parties. It pointed out that there exists no alternative to bilateral negotiations and that uni- lateral actions would only undermine efforts to reach a lasting and comprehensive settlement. 1.33.8.

This communication has been presented at a moment when the political and con- stitutional processes have been completed in Iraq through the formation of the first constitutionally elected government on 20 May 2006. It builds on the three objectives outlined in the previous com- munication which was endorsed by the European Council in June 2004, namely: a secure, stable and democratic Iraq; an open, sustainable and diversi- fied Iraqi market economy and an Iraq at peace with its neighbours and integrated into the interna- tional community. Whilst these three objectives still remain valid, the Commission has taken the oppor- tunity to take a fresh look at how the European Union (EU) can step up its engagement with Iraq. Based on an analysis of the current situation and the challenges ahead, the Commission recom- mends, in this communication, a number of new objectives. These are as follows: to endorse and support a model of democracy that overcomes divi- sions; to help improve the security situation through promotion and strengthening a system of rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights; to help the national and regional authorities to improve the delivery of basic services and to pro- mote job opportunities; to promote setting up a functioning administrative framework; and, finally, to support mechanisms paving the way for Iraq\u2019s economic recovery and prosperity. The Commis- sion stresses in the communication, that it is essen- tial that the EU work alongside other players and stakeholders, both regional and international in sup- porting Iraq\u2019s path towards stability and prosperity.

EU 6-2006 127 common spaces, but took the view that the pres- ent partnership with Russia is more pragmatic than strategic since it reflects in the first place common economic interests without achieving major results as regards human rights and the rule of law. Parliament urged the Commission to give a full explanation of its policy regarding Russia\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organisation, taking into account all negotiated areas and sectors. It called on the Commission to investigate exist- ing cases of discrimination in trade by the Rus- sian authorities against Member States such as Poland, but also against Moldova and Georgia. It also underlined the strategic importance of coop- eration on energy and the need to enhance EU\u2013 Russia energy relations, and therefore expressed its disappointment at the failure to secure an agreement in this field. Parliament emphasised the need to work together with Russia with a view to providing peace, stability and security, fighting international terrorism and violent extremism, drugs, arms and human trafficking and cross-border organised crime in the European neighbourhood. It welcomed the signing of agree- ments on visa facilitation and readmission aimed at easing visa restrictions on travel for certain cat- egories of citizens as well as facilitating the expulsion of immigrants illegally entering the EU from Russian territory. However, it expressed its regret that no progress was made on conflict res- olution in Transnistria and South Caucasus and that the Russian authorities expressed no will- ingness to engage with Belarus so as to start a genuine process of democratisation. In the field of human rights, Parliament recognised the importance of the various dialogues established to improve the functioning of EU\u2013Russian cooper- ation and partnership and underlines in particular the need for an effective human rights dialogue. 1.33.14.

Parliament has come out in favour of updating the transatlantic partnership by replacing the current new transatlantic agenda with a transatlantic partnership agreement (TPA) which should come into force in 2007. It is con- vinced that only an agreement of this kind can anchor transatlantic relations in a solid institu- tional structure. The next EU\u2013US summit, in ",
        "United States, Japan and other industrialised countries 128 Bull. EU 6-2006 Vienna on 21 June, is also expected to set itself the target of creating a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015. According to Parliament, the new transatlantic agreement had to widen the cur- rent agenda in the political, economic and secu- rity fields, with the aim being to establish a com- munity of action in terms of world and regional cooperation in all the areas where European and American interests were at stake. A common approach in relations with the main \u2018geo-strategic players\u2019 (China, India, Japan, Latin America, Russia) should also be considered. In the area of energy, Parliament also argued for a joint strategy to ensure security of supply in energy and raw materials. In the area of security and defence, it stressed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa- tion (NATO) played an important role, alongside European Union foreign and defence policy, and that NATO remained the guarantor of transat- lantic stability and security. It also recommended the development of relations between the EU and NATO, respecting the independence of the two organisations and stressed that any military inter- vention should, in principle, be under UN man- date, in line with the Charter. Furthermore, Par- liament also deplored the distrust springing from suspicions of human rights and international law violations within the affair of the secret CIA flights and extraordinary renditions in Europe. It called on the United States to cooperate unre- servedly with the Parliament temporary commit- tee on this affair. 1.33.21.

Parliament called on the United States (US) authorities to close the deten- tion camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay and to treat each prisoner in accordance with the rules set out under international humanitarian law. It called on the US authorities to implement the recommen- dations of the United Nations Committee Against Torture and to ensure that special interrogation techniques, including methods involving sexual humiliation, water boarding, \u2018short shackling\u2019 and using dogs to induce fear, that constitute torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, are not used. Moreover, Parliament noted that the US military has made significant efforts to ensure that detainees are held in better conditions than before, in particular with respect to medical care, nutrition, the expression and exercise of their reli- gious rights and recreation. However, it took the view that improvements in detention conditions do not tackle the real problem, which is that a violation of the rule of law, international law and human rights standards is the real concern. Fur- thermore, it called on the US government to clar- ify whether minors have been or are still held in Guant\u00e1namo in contravention of the UN Con- vention on the Rights of the Child and to ensure that released detainees are not returned to any state where they could face a risk of being tor- tured or subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrad- ing treatment. Finally, it called on the European Union to have a common approach for the EU\u2013US summit and to institute a joint action calling on the US government to close the Guan- t\u00e1namo Bay detention centre and act in accor- dance with international law regarding the treat- ment of detainees. 1.33.22.

This package is known as the 10th European Development Fund (EDF). The amount agreed represents an increase of about 35% on the ninth EDF that draws to an end in December 2007. The spending on the funds is based on development programmes agreed with the countries and regions concerned. The Commission agrees a ",
        "African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) and overseas countries and territories (OCTs) Bull. EU 6-2006 131 \u2018country strategy programme\u2019 with each of the beneficiary countries. Aid is allocated on the basis of objective criteria that chiefly take account of needs and past performance. An increased share of the budget will be devoted to regional programmes, underlining the importance of regional economic integration as the basic framework for national and local development. An innovation in the 10th EDF will be the cre- ation of \u2018incentive amounts\u2019 for each country. Countries can earn these extra resources by improving governance, for which an agenda will be agreed between the Commission and each individual country. In reaching the financing agreement, the joint Council took note of the impact of the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) on the ACP states. It was noted that these are important instruments for development and that they require preparation and adjustments at national and regional level. It was also noted that this is being taken into account in the final phase of the ninth EDF and in the programming for the 10th EDF. An amount of EUR 1.4 billion is already earmarked for regional integration in the 10th EDF and this could be topped up in 2010, by a decision of the Council, with unused funds from the ninth EDF. The joint Council also: held a debate on migration and development, reflect- ing the importance of development policy in managing trends in migration for the benefit of both regions of origin and destination; adopted statements on the recent earthquake in Indonesia and the unrest in East Timor. Relations with regional groupings 1.33.33. Council conclusions on Africa. Adopted on 12 June. The Council reviewed the situation in the following countries. \u00a1 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): the European Union (EU) will continue to assist and help to secure the very extensive process of political transition, in particular through support to the holding of the first democratic elections in more than 40 years. The Council fully supports the electoral calendar set by the electoral inde- pendent commission and recalls that there is no alternative plan to the holding of elections. The EU has provided substantial funding for the elec- tion preparations and is sending an electoral observation mission. The Council called upon all political forces in the DRC to continue pursuing this path of peaceful and democratic change in the run-up to the elections, starting on July 30. The EU will deploy the EUFOR RD Congo mil- itary operation, in response to a request by the United Nations, designed to provide support to the United Nations organisation mission in the DRC (MONUC) in certain situations. This deter- rence force, which will be on the ground for the duration of the electoral period, will include an advanced element deployed in Kinshasa and a back-up force. EUFOR RD Congo will build on the EU\u2019s longstanding engagement in the DRC. For the same purpose, the EU\u2019s police mission in Kinshasa (EUPOL Kinshasa) will be reinforced. The EU will continue to support the ongoing security sector reform through its mission EUSEC DRC. All these activities will be carried out in full agreement with the government of the DRC. For the period after the elections, apart from continued support for security sector reform, the EU is prepared to engage in quick impact projects to assist immediate reconstruc- tion and rehabilitation, to be followed by a long- term effort for sustainable development taking into account the principles of good governance and transparency. The ongoing process of secur- ing regional stability through the early holding of the second summit of the Great Lakes Confer- ence has the full support of the EU. \u00a1 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire: the Council called on parties to urgently take all the necessary measures for the \u2018concomitant\u2019 implementation of the process of disarmament and identification as a prerequi- site for the organisation, by the end of October 2006, of free, open, fair and transparent elections. The Council stated that, through its participation in the international working group, it would con- tinue to support the full implementation of the roadmap, under the leadership of Prime Minister Konan Banny and would be ready to push for appropriate measures against those who impeded the peace process. The Council recalled the cen- tral role of the United Nations in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \u00a1 Sudan: the Council confirmed that the EU will work for the full and rapid implementation of the Darfur peace agreement (DPA) and is willing to continue to provide planning, technical, finan- cial and equipment support for the military and police components of the African Union mission ",
        "African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) and overseas countries and territories (OCTs) 132 Bull. EU 6-2006 in sudan (AMIS). The Sudanese government and all parties in Darfur were called on to remove immediately any existing obstacles to the deliv- ery of aid and to end any obstruction of human- itarian work or of any assistance rendered to AMIS. The Council stated that the EU would take into account the new tasks arising from the DPA and the need to ensure a smooth transition to a UN-led operation in Darfur. The EU said it was ready to respond positively to the requests for support to the implementation of the DPA, including in relation to the Darfur\u2013Darfur dia- logue and consultation. Determined to continue to play a leading role in the peace process in Dar- fur, the EU organised a conference on AMIS in Brussels on 7 July. This conference will be fol- lowed by a pledging conference on reconstruc- tion and development in Darfur, to be organised by the Netherlands in September. The Council stressed that it remained deeply concerned by the risk of destabilisation caused by the Darfur crisis on Chad and the Central African Republic and by the reports of increasing instability in the Darfur refugee camps in Chad. The EU also called on Sudan and Chad to put an end to any direct or indirect support to rebel groups in the other coun- try, with a view to contribute to secure peace at their common borders. \u00a1 Somalia: deeply concerned by recent vio- lence between armed groups in and around Mogadishu, the Council urged all parties to start a dialogue aimed at consolidating reconciliation in Somalia. The EU welcomes reconciliatory statements from the transitional federal institu- tions (TFI), notes the statement from the Union of Islamic Courts and encourages a similar approach from other parties in Mogadishu. Recalling its commitment to support the development of the capacities of the Somali security sector, the Coun- cil urged all parties to observe the arms embargo scrupulously and to avoid further destabilising a country which is already flooded with armaments. \u00a1 Uganda: the Council condemned the acts of violence of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army in both northern Uganda and the subregion. The EU stands ready to contribute to put an end to the unacceptable activities of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) as well as to assist efforts to improve the humanitarian situation in northern Uganda. The Council called on the Ugandan gov- ernment to work actively for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern Uganda collaboration with other countries in the region. The LRA com- manders indicted by the ICC (International Crim- inal Court) must be apprehended and brought to justice as a matter of urgency, the Council added.

The Commission presented two communications with the aim of upgrading the European Union (EU)\u2019s relations with South Africa. The purpose of the first communication on a strategic partnership with South Africa is to give the EU a comprehensive, coherent and coordi- nated long-term framework for its relations with the Republic of South Africa, one which is mindful of South Africa\u2019s traumatic past, of its role as an anchor country in the region and of its unique position on the continent and on the global scene, while building on the \u2018millennium development goals (MDG) package\u2019, \u2018the Euro- pean consensus on development\u2019 and on the \u2018EU strategy for Africa\u2019. This strategic partner- ship will use all the tools available under the trade development and cooperation agreement (TDCA), which remains the legal framework for EU\u2013South Africa relations. It will be brought about by: moving from political dialogue to strategic political cooperation and shared objec- tives on regional, African and international issues; enhancing existing cooperation, devel- oping stronger and sustainable economic coop- eration, and extending cooperation to trade- related areas and to the social, cultural and environmental fields; bringing the Member States, the Community and South Africa together in a single and coherent framework, with clearly and jointly defined objectives, cov- ering all areas of cooperation and associating all stakeholders. In the second communication the Commission identified the following issues in the agreement which are to be considered for amendment: in the preamble, an explicit reference to the MDGs needs to be included; in Title I, with regard to the political dimension, the agreement should be ",

In addition, the resolution of outstanding trade issues requires minor changes: in Title III, on trade-related issues, rules of origin, trade in services and coop- eration and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters need to be considered; in Title IV on economic cooperation, updated word- ing must be considered for cooperation in the fields of energy, transport, agriculture and sani- tary and phyto-sanitary matters; in Title V on development cooperation, some provisions con- cerning implementation need to be brought into line with the new financial regulation of the Com- mission; in Title VI concerning cooperation in other areas, updated or new wording must be con- sidered for cultural cooperation, cooperation on matters relating to justice, freedom and security and for cooperation in the fight against drugs, money laundering and organised crime. In addi- tion, a provision on cooperation in the field of migration needs to be added: in Title VIII, the dispute settlement system should be improved in so far as trade and trade-related issues are con- cerned, in order to increase its effectiveness.

The European Community (EC) and Greenland state their intention to strengthen their partnership and cooperation in the following areas: sustainably managing fish stocks and the marine environment as well as providing fishing opportunities for the vessels of European Union (EU) Member States (this is, and will remain, an essential pillar of the partnership between the EC and Greenland and will continue to be based on the EC\u2013Greenland fisheries partnership agreement and its succes- sor protocols); cooperation in the field of edu- cation and training; cooperation in the context of Greenland\u2019s efforts to develop its economy in a sustainable way, in particular in the fields of mineral resources, tourism and culture; cooperation in the context of the EC\u2019s efforts to deal with climate change and to promote sus- tainable development in the Arctic area; coop- eration and joint scientific research on and practical development of alternative energy sources; joint research and development con- cerning northern maritime routes and Green- land\u2019s exclusive economic zone. The EC wishes to develop its cooperation with Greenland over the next seven years on the basis of a twofold partnership consisting of a streamlined fisheries partnership agreement and a comprehensive cooperation in sectors other than fisheries. The EC intends to pursue future cooperation with Greenland, in sectors other than fisheries, by means of a Council decision, taken on the basis of Article 187 of the EC Treaty, to include funding through financial support from the bud- get of up to EUR 25 million per year within the financial perspective for 2007\u201313.

In the area of VAT receipts, Parliament was extremely con- cerned by the financial loss resulting from \u2018carousels\u2019; \u00a1 agricultural spending: the report states that there had been a reduction of more than 50% in illegal spending in agriculture (from EUR 169.7 million in 2003 to EUR 82.1 million in 2004), but Parliament deplored the fact that the propensity to notify cases was dropping while amounts in subsidies were increasing; \u00a1 structural actions: losses in 2004 rose sharply: from EUR 482.2 million in 2003 to EUR 694.5 mil- lion in 2004 (including EUR 163 million from the Cohesion Fund). 1.34.10. Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the Hercule programme and its extension during the period 2007\u201313; proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amend- ing and extending Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community\u2019s financial inter- ests (Hercule programme). Reference: European Parliament and Council Decision No 804/2004/EC: OJ L 143, 30.4.2004; Bull. 4-2004, point 1.7.18 Adopted on 28 June. In its communication, the Commission presented the conclusions of OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office) on the execution of the Hercule programme and the opportunity of its continuation. On the basis of these, the Commis- sion submitted a proposal for a decision of exten- sion and of amendment of the decision currently ",
        "Protection of the Communities\u2019 financial interests and the fight against fraud 140 Bull. EU 6-2006 in force. Certain new elements are introduced. In particular, the proposal is now widened in contracts (public contracts) allocated in the field of the protection of financial interests, includ- ing smuggling and cigarette counterfeiting. Within this framework, the objectives of the Hercule programme are achieved via markets, in addi- tion to those reached by way of calls for tender. The proposal for a decision considers eligible the expenditure relating to the participation of the representatives of certain third countries, and the countries covered by the European neighbourhood policy, in order to promote the fight against fraud and any illegal activity undermining the financial interests of the Community, beyond the European Union territory, including the fight against smug- gling and the counterfeiting of cigarettes.

EU 6-2006 Taxation Article 234 of the EC Treaty 1.35.6. 21.2.2006: Case C-255/02 \u2014 Halifax a.o./Commissioners of Customs & Excise. 1) Transactions of the kind at issue in the main pro- ceedings constitute supplies of goods or services and an economic activity within the meaning of Arti- cle 2(1), Article 4(1) and (2), Article 5(1) and Arti- cle 6(1) of sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes \u2014 Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assess- ment, as amended by Council Directive 95/7/EC of 10 April 1995, provided that they satisfy the objective criteria on which those concepts are based, even if they are carried out with the sole aim of obtaining a tax advantage, without any other economic objective. 2) The sixth directive must be interpreted as preclud- ing any right of a taxable person to deduct input VAT where the transactions from which that right derives constitute an abusive practice. For it to be found that an abusive practice exists, it is necessary, first, that the transactions concerned, notwithstanding formal appli- cation of the conditions laid down by the relevant pro- visions of the sixth directive and of national legisla- tion transposing it, result in the accrual of a tax advantage the grant of which would be contrary to the purpose of those provisions. Second, it must also be apparent from a number of objective factors that the essential aim of the transactions concerned is to obtain a tax advantage. 3) Where an abusive practice has been found to exist, the transactions involved must be redefined so as to re- establish the situation that would have prevailed in the absence of the transactions constituting that abusive practice.

OJ C 131, 3.6.2006 1.35.12. 2.5.2006: Case C-341/04 \u2014 Eurofood IFCS Ltd 1) Where a debtor is a subsidiary company whose reg- istered office and that of its parent company are situ- ated in two different Member States, the presumption laid down in the second sentence of Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings, whereby the centre of main interests of that subsidiary is situated in the Member State where its registered office is situated, can be rebutted only if factors which are both objec- tive and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is dif- ferent from that which location at that registered office is deemed to reflect. That could be so in particular in the case of a company not carrying out any business in the territory of the Member State in which its reg- istered office is situated. By contrast, where a com- pany carries on its business in the territory of the Member State where its registered office is situated, the mere fact that its economic choices are or can be controlled by a parent company in another Member State is not enough to rebut the presumption laid down by that regulation. 2) On a proper interpretation of the first subparagraph of Article 16(1) of Regulation No 1346/2000, the main insolvency proceedings opened by a court of a Member State must be recognised by the courts of the other Member States, without the latter being able to review the jurisdiction of the court of the opening state. 3) On a proper interpretation of the first subparagraph of Article 16(1) of the Regulation, a decision to open insolvency proceedings for the purposes of that provi- sion is a decision handed down by a court of a Mem- ber State to which application for such a decision has been made, based on the debtor\u2019s insolvency and seek- ing the opening of proceedings referred to in Annex A to the regulation, where that decision involves the divestment of the debtor and the appointment of a liq- uidator referred to in Annex C to the regulation. Such divestment implies that the debtor loses the powers of management that he has over his assets. 4) On a proper interpretation of Article 26 of the reg- ulation, a Member State may refuse to recognise insol- vency proceedings opened in another Member State where the decision to open the proceedings was taken in flagrant breach of the fundamental right to be heard, which a person concerned by such proceedings enjoys.

EU 6-2006 Article 48 of the EEC Treaty (subsequently Article 48 of the EC Treaty and now, after amendment, Article 39 EC) must be interpreted as precluding national legisla- tion, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not permit natural persons in receipt of income from employment in one Member State, and assessable to tax on their total income there, to have income losses relating to their own use of a private dwelling in another Member State taken into account for the purposes of determining the rate of taxation applicable to their income in the former state, whereas positive rental income relating to such a dwelling is taken into account.

It is for the national court to ascertain whether, having regard to the circumstances in the main proceedings, the application of the national provision is liable to prevent the access to the market of products from other Mem- ber States or to impede that access more than it impedes the access to the market of domestic products and, if that is the case, to determine whether the measure concerned is justified by an objective in the general interest within the meaning given to that concept in the Court\u2019s case-law or by one of the objectives listed in Article 30 EC, and whether that measure is proportionate to that objective.

OLAF investigation report \u2014 Inadmissibility of action for annulment \u2014 Action for damages. Mr Cam\u00f3s Grau, an official of the European Commis- sion, brought an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) for annulment of the decision by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) approving the findings of a report closing an investigation into IRELA (Institute for European\u2013Latin American Relations) and compen- sation for non-material damage and for damage to his employment prospects. The Commission was the defendant on account of OLAF\u2019s attachment to it for administrative and bud- getary purposes, OLAF having no legal personality. After a series of reports concerning budgetary irregu- larities, OLAF decided to open an investigation. Its report concluded with a recommendation for discipli- nary and criminal measures against the applicant. But when the report was referred to them, the Belgian and Spanish prosecution services terminated the case. Fol- lowing a supplementary administrative investigation by the Investigation and Disciplinary Office (IDOC), DG ADMIN terminated the disciplinary proceedings. The applicant asked the Court to annul the OLAF investigation report and applied for damages for the harm sustained. Regarding the annulment of the OLAF report termi- nating the investigation, the Court held that the appli- cation was inadmissible on the ground that it was directed against a document having no legal effects which were binding on the applicant or capable of affecting his interests by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position. While it was true that a report terminating an investi- gation, which is a completed document, adopted at the end of an autonomous administrative procedure by a service having functional independence, cannot, on that ground, be categorised as a preparatory measure, that fact alone does not confer on it the nature of an act having binding legal effects. While OLAF may rec- ommend in its reports that measures be adopted hav- ing binding legal effects adversely affecting the per- sons concerned, the opinion it provides in that regard imposes no obligation, even of a procedural nature, on the authorities to which it is addressed. It was clear from Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of 25 May 1999 concerning investiga- tions conducted by OLAF that the findings of OLAF, which are set out in a final report, do not lead auto- matically to the initiation of judicial or disciplinary proceedings, since the competent authorities are free to decide what action to take pursuant to a final report. Regarding the harm in respect of which the applicant sought damages, the Court examined in detail the var- ious aspects of the investigation and concluded that the conflict of interests alleged by the applicant was real and could have influenced the outcome of the investi- gation, thus seriously and manifestly violating the requirement of impartiality. The violation constituted a fault for which the Community could be held liable, since there was a direct and certain causal link with the damage claimed by the applicant. The Court excluded all forms of material damage as no conse- quences could be drawn from the investigation report once the procedure had been terminated with no fur- ther action taken. But the Court recognised that the applicant had sustained non-material damage and awarded compensation in the amount applied for \u2014 EUR 10 000. 1.35.100.

        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance Bull. EU 6-2006 151 the Member States. In particular it provides that a third-country national lawfully living in the European Community is in principle entitled to be joined by his or her children by way of family reunification. The directive allows Member States to provide for certain derogations. Parliament applied for annulment of three derogations from that principle as being contrary to fundamental rights, in particular the right to family life and the right to non-discrimination. The derogations are as follows: \u00a1 the possibility to verify whether a child aged over 12 years who arrives independently from the rest of his/her family meets a condition for integration; \u00a1 the possibility to authorise applications in respect of children only if they are submitted before they reach the age of 15; \u00a1 the possibility to impose a waiting period of up to three years between submission of the application for family reunification and the issue of a residence per- mit to the family members. The Court recalled that the legality of a directive is assessed by reference to the general principles of law the observance of which the Court ensures, of which fundamental rights form an integral part. The Court had regard in particular to: \u00a1 the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), expressly mentioned in Article 6(2) of the Union Treaty, which is particularly significant; \u00a1 two United Nations conventions \u2014 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted on 19.12.1966 and in force since 23.3.1976) and the Con- vention on the Rights of the Child (adopted on 20.11.1989 and in force since 2.9.1990) (first citation by the Court); \u00a1 the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which the Community legislature refers to in the directive, although it is not a legally binding instru- ment (first reference to the Charter by the Court). The Court proceeded on the basis of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights to hold that respect for family life is among the fundamental rights protected in Community law and results in obligations for the Member States which may be negative, when a Member State is required not to deport a person, or positive, when it is required to let a person enter and reside in its territory. But international human rights instruments do not create for family members an indi- vidual right to enter the territory and cannot be inter- preted as denying Member States a certain margin of appreciation when they examine applications for fam- ily reunification. The directive goes beyond those provisions and imposes precise positive obligations, with correspon- ding clearly defined individual rights, such as the right to family reunification for children aged under 12. The effect of the derogations provided for by the direc- tive, on the other hand, is to preserve a limited margin of appreciation for the Member States by permitting them, before authorising entry and residence of the child under the directive, to consider whether it meets an integration criterion provided for by national legis- lation. That limited margin of appreciation is no dif- ferent from that accorded to them by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in its case-law relating to the right in question. The Court further pointed out that Member States are also specifically required by the directive, when weigh- ing competing interests, to have due regard to the best interests of minor children on a case-by-case basis in the light of the criteria also used by the European Court of Human Rights. In the final analysis, while the directive leaves the Member States a margin of appreciation, it is suffi- ciently broad to enable them to apply the rules of the directive in a manner consistent with the requirements flowing from the protection of fundamental rights. The Court concluded that none of the three derogation pro- visions could be regarded as running counter to the rights at issue, either in themselves or in that they expressly or impliedly authorised the Member States to act in such a way. 1.35.101.

Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States passed legislation in November 2001 providing that air carriers operating flights to, from or across United States territory have to provide the United States customs authorities with electronic access to the data contained in their automated reser- vation and departure control systems, called \u2018passenger name records\u2019 (\u2018PNR data\u2019). The Commission entered into negotiations with the United States authorities to settle the potential conflict between the US provisions and Community and Mem- ber State legislation on data protection. On the basis of undertakings on the part of the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Commis- sion adopted a decision finding the arrangements for the protection of personal data transferred to the United States adequate and in line with the requirements of the data protection directive. At the same time the Council adopted a decision on the conclusion of an agreement with the United States guaranteeing US compliance with the CBP undertakings, based on Arti- cle 95 of the Treaty. In its actions challenging the two decisions, Parliament advanced several pleas for annulment alleging, respec- tively, ultra vires action, breach of the fundamental principles of the directive, breach of fundamental rights, and breach of the principle of proportionality. As regards the Commission decision, the Court observed that the data protection directive excludes from its scope the processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as activities provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, and in any case processing operations concerning public security, defence, state security and the activities of the state in areas of criminal law. The Court observed that while PNR data are initially collected by airlines in the course of an activity falling within the scope of Community law, namely sale of an airline ticket which provides entitlement to a supply of services, but the data processing which was taken into account in the decision on adequacy was quite differ- ent in nature. The decision concerned not data pro- cessing necessary for a supply of services, but data pro- cessing regarded as necessary for safeguarding public security and for law-enforcement purposes. The trans- fer of PNR data to the CBP constituted processing operations concerning public security and the activities of the state in areas of criminal law and accordingly fell outside the scope of the data protection directive. The Court annulled the Commission decision on the grounds that it could not be based on the directive. On the same grounds \u2014 lack of powers to act under the EC Treaty \u2014 it also annulled the Council decision. Aware of the implications and of the Community\u2019s international obligations and realising that the agree- ment remained applicable for 90 days following noti- fication of its termination, the Court decided to pre- serve the effect of the adequacy decision until 30 September 2006. 1.35.102. Case C-217/04 United Kingdom v European Parliament and Council . European Network and Information Security Agency. The Court has given a series of judgments clarifying the conditions for the use of Article 95 of the EC Treaty to approximate national legislation. The United Kingdom applied for annulment of the reg- ulation establishing the European Network and Infor- mation Security Agency on the ground that Article 95 of the EC Treaty was not the appropriate legal basis. Article 95 provides for the adoption by the co-decision procedure of measures to approximate the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action of the Member States which have as their object the func- tioning of the internal market. According to the United Kingdom, the article could not be used as the legal basis for establishing a Community agency with an advisory role. The appropriate legal basis would rather be Article 308. The Court first established the principles governing the choice of Article 95 as a legal basis: \u00a1 that provision is used as a legal basis only where it is actually and objectively apparent from the legal act that its purpose is to improve the conditions for the establishment and functioning of the internal market; \u00a1 the article confers a discretion as regards the method of approximation most appropriate for achiev- ing the desired result; \u00a1 nothing in the wording of the article implies that the addressees of the measures adopted by the Com- munity legislature on the basis of it can only be the individual Member States. The legislature may deem it necessary to provide for the establishment of a Community body responsible for contributing to the implementation of a process of harmonisation in situations where the adoption of non- binding supporting and framework measures seems appropriate. The Court emphasised, however, that the tasks conferred on such a body must be closely linked to the subject-matter of the acts approximating the ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance Bull. EU 6-2006 153 laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States. The Court then went on to analyse the regulation at issue, examining the objectives laid down for the agency and the tasks conferred on it. It concluded that the agency\u2019s tasks and objectives were closely linked to the objectives pursued by the framework directive and the specific directives in the area of network and information security. The Community legislature was therefore justified in considering that the establishment of a Community body such as the agency was an appropriate means of preventing the emergence of dis- parities likely to create obstacles to the smooth func- tioning of the internal market in the area. Similarly, it was also entitled to consider that the opinion of an independent authority providing technical advice at the request of the Commission and the Member States might facilitate the transposition of the directives at issue into the laws of the Member States and the implementation of those directives at national level. Consequently the regulation was rightly based on Arti- cle 95 EC. The Court dismissed the United Kingdom action. 1.35.103. Case C-436/03 European Parliament v Council European cooperative society (SCE). The Commission intervened in this action for annul- ment to support Parliament in challenging the use of Article 308 of the EC Treaty, which the Council had decided to use in place of Article 95, initially proposed by the Commission as the basis for the regulation on the statute for a European cooperative society. For the Commission, laying down a statute for a Euro- pean cooperative society seeks to improve the condi- tions for the establishment and functioning of the inter- nal market by allowing cooperative societies to operate beyond national borders. The Court rejected this argument. It held that the con- tested regulation, which leaves unchanged the different national laws already in existence, could not be regarded as aiming to approximate the laws of the Member States applicable to cooperative societies, but had as its purpose the creation of a new form of coop- erative society in addition to the national forms. Arti- cle 95 could not therefore constitute a legal basis for the regulation. 1.35.104. Case C-459/03 Commission v Ireland . Exclusive jurisdiction of the Court \u2014 Dispute settle- ment system provided for under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \u2014 Undertaking not to submit a dispute relating to the interpretation or application of the Treaty to a method of settlement other than those provided for by the Treaty \u2014 Arti- cle 292 of the Treaty (first application). In this case the Commission was relying for the first time on Articles 292 EC and 192 EAEC, which require the Member States to undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein. Ireland had commenced proceedings against the United Kingdom in the Arbitral Tribunal provided for by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\u2018the Convention\u2019) to settle a dispute relating to the MOX nuclear fuels reprocessing plant at Sellafield on the coast of the Irish Sea. The Court held that Ireland had violated its exclusive jurisdiction. It had already ruled that mixed agreements have the same status in the Community legal order as purely Community agreements, as these are provisions coming within the scope of Community competence. Ireland\u2019s breach of Article 292 also lay in its failure respect the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court by bring- ing before the Arbitral Tribunal a dispute between it and another Member State concerning the interpreta- tion and application of provisions of Community law, especially as Community law provides for procedures such as the Article 227 procedure for the purpose of obtaining a declaration that another Member State has breached those provisions. Lastly, the Court held that Ireland had breached Arti- cle 10 of the Treaty by bringing proceedings in the Arbitral Tribunal without having first informed and consulted the competent Community institutions. 1.35.105. Case C-173/03 Traghetti del Mediter- raneo SpA v Repubblica italiana . Infringements of Community law attributable to a national court adjudicating at last instance \u2014 Non-contractual liability of Member States \u2014 Damage caused to individuals. This reference for a preliminary ruling concerned the principle of and the conditions governing the non- contractual liability of Member States for damage caused to individuals by a breach of Community law where that breach is attributable to a national court. The reference was made in the context of proceedings brought against the Repubblica italiana by Traghetti del Mediterraneo SpA (\u2018TDM\u2019), a maritime transport undertaking currently in liquidation, for compensation for the damage suffered as a result of an incorrect inter- pretation of Community rules by the Corte Suprema di Cassazione (Italian Supreme Court of Cassation) and of its refusal to refer questions of Community law for ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance 154 Bull. EU 6-2006 interpretation under the third paragraph of Arti- cle 234of the EC Treaty. The Court had already answered the first question in Case C-224/01 K\u00f6bler (judgment given on 30 Septem- ber 2003): the principle that Member States are obliged to make good damage caused to individuals by infringements of Community law for which they are responsible is also applicable where the alleged infringement stems from a decision of a court adjudi- cating at last instance. Having regard to the specific nature of the judicial function, the Court held that state liability in such a case was not unlimited and could be incurred only in exceptional cases where the national court adjudicating at last instance had manifestly infringed the applica- ble law. Analogous considerations linked to the need to guar- antee effective judicial protection to individuals of the rights conferred on them by Community law similarly precluded state liability not being incurred solely because an infringement of Community law attributa- ble to a national court adjudicating at last instance arose from the interpretation of provisions of law made by that court. To exclude all state liability in such cir- cumstances would be tantamount to rendering mean- ingless the principle laid down by the Court in the K\u00f6bler judgment. The Court held that an analogous conclusion must be drawn with regard to legislation which in a general manner excludes all state liability where the infringe- ment attributable to a court of that state arises from its assessment of the facts and evidence. The Court acknowledged that it remains possible for national law to define the criteria relating to the nature or degree of the infringement which must be met before state liability can be incurred for an infringe- ment of Community law attributable to a national court adjudicating at last instance, but under no circum- stances may such criteria impose requirements stricter than those flowing from K\u00f6bler . 1.35.106. Case C-372/04 Yvonne Watts v Bedford Primary Care Trust, Secretary of State for Health . Social policy. Mobility of patients \u2014 Medical expenses incurred in another Member State. The Bedford Primary Care Trust refused to authorise Ms Watts to undergo a hip operation in another Mem- ber State. In the United Kingdom she would have had to wait a year, though this was cut to three or four months in view of the deterioration in her health. Ms Watts eventually had the operation performed in France and paid for it. She began proceedings to have her medical fees reimbursed in the United Kingdom. The Court analysed the issue in terms both of Regula- tion (EEC) No 1408/71, coordinating the Member States\u2019 social security schemes, and of Article 49 of the Treaty, securing the freedom to provide services. The Community social security system For the Court the decisive question is whether treat- ment can be given to the patient in the Member State of residence within the time normally necessary, tak- ing account of his current state of health and the prob- able course of his disease (Article 22 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71). To determine whether the refusal to reimburse was legitimate, the Court analysed a variety of factors while striking a balance between the interests at stake. It held in particular that in a context \u2018where the demand for hospital treatment is constantly rising, primarily as a consequence of medical progress and increased life expectancy, and the supply is necessarily limited by budgetary constraints, it cannot be denied that the national authorities responsible for managing the sup- ply of such treatment are entitled, if they consider it necessary, to institute a system of waiting lists in order to manage the supply of that treatment and to set pri- orities on the basis of the available resources and capacity\u2019. But, in order to be entitled to refuse to grant authori- sation on the ground that there is a waiting time for treatment, the competent institution is required to establish that such waiting time is acceptable on the basis of an objective medical assessment of the clini- cal needs of the person concerned in the light of his medical condition and the history and probable course of his illness, the degree of pain he was in and/or the nature of his disability at the time when the authorisa- tion sought. There are two hypotheses. If the waiting time is reasonable, the mere fact that treatment which is the same or equally effective is available more quickly in another Member State does not suffice to challenge a decision to refuse authorisa- tion. Otherwise, patient migration would be liable to put at risk the competent Member State\u2019s planning and rationalisation efforts in the vital healthcare sector. If the waiting time is excessive, the fact that the cost of the hospital treatment envisaged in another Member State may be higher than it would have been had it been provided in a hospital covered by the national system in question cannot be a legitimate ground for refusing authorisation. Nor can the fact that the grant of the authorisation sought would oblige a national health service such as that in the United Kingdom, ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance Bull. EU 6-2006 155 which is characterised by free hospital treatment, to establish a financial mechanism for reimbursement. Freedom to provide hospital services The Court considered the requirement that the assump- tion of costs of hospital treatment provided in another Member State be subject to prior authorisation to be both necessary and reasonable. To meet the proportionality principle this restriction must be based on objective, non-discriminatory crite- ria which are known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities\u2019 discretion, so that it is not used arbitrarily. A refusal to grant prior authorisation cannot be based merely on the existence of waiting lists enabling the supply of hos- pital care to be planned and managed on the basis of predetermined general clinical priorities, without car- rying out in the individual case in question an objec- tive medical assessment on the basis of the criteria con- sidered above. The Court was at pains to undertake a well-balanced analysis reflecting both the management and policy constraints in the Member States\u2019 hospital systems and the requirements flowing from the Community free- doms. As the Court pointed out, the achievement of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty inevitably requires Member States to make adjustments to their social security systems but it does not follow that this undermines their sovereign powers in the field. 1.35.107. Case C-423/04 Sarah Margaret Richards v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions . Equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security \u2014 Gender reassignment surgery and implications for retirement pension purposes. Reference: Council Directive 79/7/EEC on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security: OJ L 6, 10.1.1979 Following gender reassignment surgery, Ms Richards applied to the Secretary of State for a retirement pen- sion to be paid from the age of 60, the legal retirement age for women in the United Kingdom. Her application was refused and she appealed to the Social Security Commissioner, who referred the case to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the compatibility with Community law of legislation which denies a person who has undergone male-to-female gender reassignment entitlement to a retirement pen- sion on the ground that she has not reached the age of 65, when she would have been entitled to such a pen- sion at the age of 60 had she been held to be a woman. The Court began by restating that it is for the Member States to determine the conditions under which legal recognition is given to gender reassignment. But it stressed that Directive 79/7/EEC on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security was the embodiment in the field of social security of the prin- ciple of equal treatment of men and women, which is one of the fundamental principles of Community law. In view of its purpose and the nature of the rights which it seeks to safeguard, the scope of that directive is also such as to apply to discrimination arising from the gender reassignment of the person concerned. The Court accordingly concluded that there was discrimi- nation by comparing the situation of a transsexual who had become a woman with the situation of women who had always been women, thereby undertaking a com- parison between women. As the unequal treatment here was based on the fact that Ms Richards was unable to have her new post-sur- gery gender recognised for the purposes of the retire- ment legislation, it must be regarded as discrimination which is prohibited by the directive. In this context, the Court recalled that in the absence of harmonisation at Community level it is for Member States to organise their social security systems and determine the conditions for entitlement to benefits. Nevertheless, they must comply with Community law when exercising that power. 1.35.108. Case C-124/05 Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging (FNV) v Staat der Nederlanden. Social policy \u2014 Right to paid annual leave \u2014 Financial compensation for not taking the mini- mum period of paid annual leave. This reference for a preliminary ruling involved the interpretation of Directive 93/104/EC concerning cer- tain aspects of the organisation of working time, which requires the Member States to ensure that every worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks (Article 7 of the directive, as repealed and replaced by Directive 2003/88/EC). The minimum period of paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment rela- tionship is terminated. An information brochure published by the Dutch Min- istry of Social Affairs and Employment interpreted the Dutch rules on leave as meaning that, during the life of the employment contract, employers and employees could agree in writing that financial compensation be paid in the following year to an employee who had not used up all or part of his minimum leave entitlement. The FNV brought an action challenging this interpre- tation on the ground that it was incompatible with the working time directive. ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance 156 Bull. EU 6-2006 The Court first recalled that harmonisation at Com- munity level in relation to the organisation of working time is intended to guarantee better protection of the safety and health of workers by ensuring that they are entitled to minimum rest periods, particularly paid annual leave, and adequate breaks. The entitlement of every worker to paid annual leave must be regarded as a particularly important principle of Community social law. The positive effect which that leave has for the safety and health of the worker is deployed fully if it is taken in the year prescribed for that purpose, namely the current year. However, the significance of that rest period in that regard remains if it is taken during a later period. Even then, it can still contribute to the safety and health of the worker and therefore continues to be subject to the directive. The possibility of financial compensation in respect of the minimum period of annual leave carried over would create an incentive, incompatible with the objec- tives of the directive, not to take leave or to encourage employees not to do so. 1.35.109. Case C-397/03P, Archer Daniels Mid- land Co. and Archer Daniels Midland Ingredi- ents Ltd v Commission. Competition \u2014 Fine \u2014 Ne bis in idem principle. The case began when certain companies, including ADM, were charged by the American authorities with having formed a cartel and they were fined in the United States. The Commission subsequently carried out investiga- tions and charged the companies concerned with hav- ing also formed a lysine cartel and fixed sales quotas in the EEA. Following its investigations, the Commis- sion adopted a decision fining the companies. The Court of First Instance reduced the fine but other- wise rejected their appeal (T-224/00). In support of their further appeal, the applicants relied, among other things, on the ne bis in idem principle (the right not to be charged or punished twice for the same offence), arguing that the fines imposed for the same acts should have been set off or taken into account. The Court held that even if the sanction imposed by the authorities of a non-member country was a factor to be taken into account in assessing the facts of the case in question in order to set the amount of the fine, the plea could only succeed if the actions of ADM com- plained of by the Commission and by the authorities of the United States and Canada were identical. Such was not the case where the sanction imposed in the non- member country related only to the applications or effects of the cartel on the market in that non-member country and the Community sanction related only to the applications or effects of the cartel on the Com- munity market. 1.35.110. Case T-198/03 Bank Austria Credi- tanstalt AG v Commission . Competition \u2014 Publication of a decision finding an infringement of Article 81 EC and imposing fines \u2014 Rejection of a request to omit certain passages. One of the Austrian banks in this case opposed publi- cation of the full Commission decision imposing fines for its participation in a cartel with several other Aus- trian banks. The Commission\u2019s hearing officer over- ruled the applicant\u2019s objection, and the decision was published. The applicant contested the hearing officer\u2019s decision. The main interest of the judgment concerns the rela- tionship between the transparency principle and the duty to respect business secrets and protect private data in competition proceedings. Following earlier competition decisions, the Court of First Instance began by drawing a distinction between business secrets, enjoying absolute protection, and other types of information covered by professional secrecy. It defined the types of information that by their nature are covered by professional secrecy. Assessments as to the confidentiality of a piece of information require the legitimate interests opposing disclosure of the information to be weighed against the public interest that the activities of the Community institutions take place as openly as possible. The Court then made a further distinction between types of information, to the effect that certain infor- mation subject to professional secrecy may be divulged to third parties having a right to be heard in respect thereof but not to the public. Regarding the link with other legislative instruments regulating access to information, the Court held that, where such acts of secondary legislation \u2014 for exam- ple Regulations Nos 45/2001 and 1049/2001 \u2014 pro- hibit the disclosure of information to the public or exclude public access to documents containing it, that information must be regarded as covered by profes- sional secrecy. Conversely, where the public has a right of access to documents containing certain information, that information cannot be considered to be of the kind covered by professional secrecy. The Court of First Instance made clear that Regulation No 45/2001 seeks to protect individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. The applicant, who was a legal person, did not belong to the group of per- sons which the regulation is intended to protect. The Court accordingly dismissed all the applicant\u2019s pleas. 1.35.111.

        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance Bull. EU 6-2006 157 State aid Tax regime for coordination centres established in Belgium \u2014 Protection of legitimate expectations. These cases concerned the tax scheme in Belgium for coordination centres, which are companies belonging to multinational groups and exercising certain specific functions within them, particularly in financial matters . The Commission declared the scheme incompatible with the common market in 2003. Forum 187, an asso- ciation grouping the centres, and Belgium challenged the Commission decision. The first question was whether the Commission could take that decision as it had approved the coordination centres scheme in 1984 and again in 1987. The Court of First Instance replied in the affirmative: the Treaty entrusts the Commission with the task of keeping under constant review all systems of aid. It was therefore entitled to review the scheme. Tax aid schemes are within the Treaty rules on state aid schemes and the Commission is entitled to declare them incompatible. The second question concerned the legitimate expec- tations of the aid recipients, in other words the coor- dination centres. By the 1984 and 1987 decisions, con- firmed by a memorandum of 1990, the Commission created a legitimate expectation that the scheme in question did not contain any aid element and that the centres would in any event have the time needed to address any change in the Commission\u2019s approach. But while the Court acknowledged their rights, it imposed very tight limits: only coordination centres with an application for renewal of their authorisation pending on the date on which the contested decision was noti- fied or with an authorisation which expired at the same time as or shortly after that decision was notified were entitled to have a legitimate expectation (the Court defined what it meant by \u2018shortly after\u2019). It is interesting that the Court excluded the possibility that the conclusions adopted by the Council in Novem- ber 2000 could generate legitimate expectations. They merely expressed a political intention and could not be binding on the Commission in the exercise of its own powers under the Treaty. The Court also annulled the unanimous Council deci- sion adopted under the third paragraph of Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty setting aside the Commission decision and declaring the aid scheme compatible. It recalled its judgment in Case C-110/02 Commission v Council of 29 June 2004, in which it held that the right con- ferred on the Council to take a unanimous decision on a state aid scheme can never be exercised where the Commission has already taken a decision on the same scheme.

This synthesis report is designed to reinforce accountability, in line with the Commission's strong commitment to sound management of funds entrusted to it by European Union (EU) taxpayers. In it, the Commission acknowledged that further efforts are needed in order to solve a number of weaknesses, in par- ticular those highlighted in the reservations of the Directors-General. It will therefore ensure that its efforts to guarantee that reasonable assurance in the declarations accompanying the annual reports are effectively underpinned by appropriate inter- nal control systems. The report provides a summary of the progress made in 2005 towards fully developing the per- formance potential of the Commission's man- agement and control systems in such areas as the following. \u00a1 Promoting the Commission\u2019s accountability: the annual activity reports for 2005 were based on a stronger methodology and a more coherent approach, by \u2018families\u2019 of services. Full accrual accounting was applied to the EU budget for the first time, and while a number of adjustments and corrections are still being implemented, the Commission considers that a remarkable achieve- ment has been reached in very short time. \u00a1 Enhancing effective performance manage- ment: the culture of effectiveness of internal con- trol continued to gather pace and will be further embedded by focusing more on proportionality and cost-effectiveness of controls; 2005 was the first year of introduction of the new Commission- wide methodology on risk management; action to improve the quality of objectives and indica- tors was launched. \u00a1 Reinforcing the Commission\u2019s responsibility and monitoring capacity: improvements aimed at simplification were proposed or implemented; an action plan on moving to an integrated internal control framework was presented; the follow-up of action plans and the reliability and robustness of internal control strategies were improved. COM(2006) 277 Proposals adopted 1.36.14. The Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (European instrument for democracy and human rights) ( \u2192 point 1.5.13) and a pro- posal for a decision on authorising Member States to ratify the 2006 Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation ( \u2192 point 1.8.7).
