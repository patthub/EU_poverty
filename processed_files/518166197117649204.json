        "MONTHLY NEWS AND REPORTS FROM THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT European Parliament, May 1999 MEPs endorse Prodi as President M EPs voted 392 to 72 with 41 abstentions to endorse Ro\u00ad mano Prodi as the new Commission President, with his term of office in the first instance to run until the end of the year. He is now faced with the task, in conjunction with the national governments, of putting together a top quality team, which will have to face a grilling before the new Parliament's committees at special hearings due to be held in the first week of September. Mr Prodi has promised to have his team ready for 20 July, when the new Parliament will meet for the first time. But this will contain a new intake, with almost half the newcomers only too well aware that the most dramatic act of the outgoing Parlia\u00ad ment was to force the previous Commis\u00ad sion to resign. This will undoubtedly mean MEPs flexing their muscles by subjecting the proposed candidates for Commission\u00ad ers to detailed scrutiny. Although Mr Prodi has already empha\u00ad sised his determination to use the new pow\u00ad ers of the Amsterdam Treaty \u00ad which give him a say in the choice of fellow Commis\u00ad sioners \u00ad to the maximum by insisting on high calibre candidates, he was warned by MEPs to make sure there is a proper gen\u00ad der balance. Furthermore, whichever party comes out the strongest after the June elec\u00ad tions will be looking closely at the politi\u00ad cal credentials of the candidates for Commissioners. Outlining his priorities to MEPs, he an\u00ad nounced his intention to draw a clear dividing line between the \"political\" and \"adminis\u00ad trative\" function of the Commission. Com\u00ad missioners would be responsible for drawing up policy in agreement with each other, leav\u00ad ing civil servants in the directorates gener\u00ad al to implement it. He openly admitted that there would have to be more direct re\u00ad sponsibility and autonomy for the Direc\u00ad torates General if the mistakes of the previous administration were not to be re\u00ad peated. He also announced his intention to tackle the system of \"cabinets\" or person\u00ad al assistants for Commissioners, often se\u00ad lected on the basis of political patronage, and seen as interfering in the running of policy \"The cabinets need to acquire a more markedly supranational structure and must simply serve as an instrument supporting poli\u00ad cies developed by the President and the Com\u00ad missioners,\" he said. To prove his intention to carry out his reform, he then appointed a distinguished Irish Commission Official David O'Sullivan to lead his own cabinet. Mr Prodi is determined to give the new Commission a sharper political edge by con\u00ad centrating policy on strategic areas such as foreign policy, monetary affairs and inter\u00ad nal security, under the supervision of senior vice\u00adpresidents. Mr Prodi's later remarks in Britain about the creation of a \"European army\" and the Commission becoming the \"government for the power that is given to Europe\", confirm this intention but have to be placed in con\u00ad text. The Commission's powers are clearly limited and while Mr Prodi undoubtedly sup\u00ad ports closer defence co\u00adoperation, he told MEPs this could be based on \"the gradual and progressive model which has already been used for monetary union\", in other words, a scaled\u00addown role for the Commission. In fact, discussions are already underway at an inter\u00adgovemmental level under the Ger\u00ad man Presidency on how to strengthen co\u00ad operation without involving other Nato countries or the USA. Here the political re\u00ad ality is that a reliable EU defence policy in\u00ad dependent of the US A would require increased spending by most of the member states. In his address to MEPs, Mr Prodi con\u00ad centrated on the EU's international role and the forthcoming round of trade liberalisa\u00ad tion talks under the World Trade Organisa\u00ad tion where the Commission will play a key role in negotiations. With the euro offering currency stability, he looked to the EU tak\u00ad ing the lead in bringing a solution to the con\u00ad flict in the Balkans. He saw a \"more integrated and open\" EU as a model to heal differences between peoples and nations. But the Commission's role here will be essen\u00ad tially advisory and concerned with the or\u00ad ganisation of humanitarian aid. Even after the introduction of the Amsterdam Treaty, the political initiative will remain firmly with the member states. Mr Prodi's other concerns were with in\u00ad Romano Prodi speaking after his endorsement by MEPs temal security across a continent without bor\u00ad der controls and economic policies to con\u00ad quer unemployment, where he came out in favour of tax cuts, another policy area firm\u00ad ly in the hands of national government, as decisions have to be agreed unanimously. He was, however, criticised by some MEPs for neglecting social policy or mea\u00ad sures to help those living on the margins. \"Your speech today talked very little of people. You mentioned employment but did not talk much about the need for the fight against social exclusion, the struggle for a fair and just Europe for all our citizens, the need to support member states in the erad\u00ad ication of poverty \u00ad in particular amongst the young and the old in our societies \u00ad and the need for equal opportunities for men and women, and for black and white citi2ens of the European Union,\" said PES leader Pauline Green (London North). But while acknowledging these concerns, Mr Prodi looked to the future and painted a picture of a Europe in 2005 with a single currency part of everyday life, a more lib\u00ad eral economy and enlargement well under\u00ad way. Success in all these areas would be no mean achievement. AX\u00adAD 99\u00ad004\u00adEN\u00adC ISSN\u00ad0250 5754 EPNews Backing for move to reduce VAT A COMMISSION move to allow member states to apply a reduced rate of VAT to labour\u00ad intensive industries such as hairdressing as a means of reducing unemployment has been backed by MEPs this month. Experts from Europe's building industry calculate that up to 270,000 jobs could be created in the maintenance sector alone, es\u00ad pecially as VAT is more than 20 per cent in some countries, such as Belgium and France. In Britain, a spokesman for the National Hair\u00ad dressers Federation said a VAT cut would increase the number of people employed in the sector, lead to increased investment and help to reduce prices. Urging the British government to take ad\u00ad vantage of the new arrangement, Graham Mather (Hampshire North and Oxford, EPP) said, \"When the proposal was launched in November 1997, it was hailed as a 'sharp change of policy' by EU Tax Commission\u00ad er Mario Monti. The slow progress of this proposal through the EU's legislative labyrinth illustrates that most member states are terrified of cutting taxes.\" In his address to MEPs, Commission President designate Romano Prodi supported tax reductions as a means of creating new jobs. More talks on common salary THIS MONTH MEPs decided to pursue talks with EU Ministers in a bid to settle out\u00ad standing differences over the question of a common salary for MEPs. Both Parliament and Council have to agree on the rules gov\u00ad erning pay and conditions, and although there is acceptance of a common salary of \u00a345.000 per annum, MEPs want to continue talks with Council to iron out difficulties over pensions and taxation questions. It is hoped an agree\u00ad ment on these points can be reached by the end of the year. MEPs pack their bags THE EUROPEAN Parliament's fourth term of office came to an end this week, with MEPs sitting for three night sessions to clear the backlog of legislation and voting through some 100 reports on a whole range of is\u00ad sues, from charges for heavy lorries using Europe's roads to the conservation of trop\u00ad ical forests. The Parliament now goes into recess and will reconvene after the June elec\u00ad tions on 20 July 1999. A special tribute was paid to outgoing President Jos\u00e9 Maria Gil\u00adRobles, who was praised for his integrity and for his unswerv\u00ad ing commitment to defending Parliament's independence. While many MEPs will be hitting the campaign trail, for quite a num\u00ad ber this was their last Strasbourg session. The new Parliament will be a much\u00ad changed body, with many senior MEPs standing down. These include from the British members Lord Plumb (The Cotswolds, EPP), former President of the Parliament and ACP/EU Joint Assembly. Another MEP who is standing down is The week in Strasbourg \u25a0 The work of the present European Parliament came to an end, with MEPs putting the finishing touches to the Agenda 2000 programme, which stems from the Berlin Summit and which is designed to pave the way for enlargement and the Europe of the next century. A last-minute deal was struck with Council to increase funding to tackle unemployment and other social issues by some \u00a31.5bn over the next seven years. \u25a0 The House also heard from G\u00fcnter Verheugen, President of Council, on preparations for the June Summit in Cologne, which marks the end of the German Presidency. Mr Verheugen announced German plans to tackle unemployment. Ken Collins (Strathclyde East, PES), the Chairman of the Environment Committee, and one of the \"Class of '79\", who entered the first directly elected Parliament. He is joined by fellow Scot, Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands of Scotland, ERA) who also bows out. She first joined as a nom\u00ad inated member in 1975, and is stepping down to become \"Mother\" of the newly elected Scottish Parliament. Other members of the Class of '79 group standing down include, on the Labour side Alf Lomas (London North East, PES) and Yorkshire MEP Tom Megahy (PES). Oth\u00ad er long\u00adserving MEPs bowing out include Lord Tomlinson (Birmingham West, PES) and Baroness Christine Crawley (Birm\u00ad ingham East, PES), both elected for West Midlands seats in 1984 and set to pursue careers in the House of Lords. Alexander Falconer (Mid Scotland and Fife, PES) and David Morris (South and West Wales, PES), Stan Newens (London Central, PES) and Eddie Newman (Greater Man\u00ad chester Central, PES), all also elected in 1984 will not be returning, and neither will Alex Smith ( South of Scotland, PES) another from the 1989 intake. Peter Crampton (Humber\u00ad side, PES), Lyndon Harrison (Cheshire West and Wirral. PES) and Michael Hindley (Lancashire South, PES) are also standing down. The former leader of the British Labour group Wayne David (South Wales Central, PES) stood down to contest a seat for the Welsh Assembly but was not successful. For the Tories, Sir Jack Stewart\u00adClark (Sussex East and Kent South, EPP), who was first elected as MEP for Sussex East in 1979 and is former Vice\u00adPresident of the Parlia\u00ad ment, is leaving. Anne Mcintosh (Essex North and Suffolk South, EPP) will be con\u00ad centrating on her Westminster duties as MP and Tom Spencer (Surrey, EPP) will not be contesting the elections. There has been fall out from both the ma\u00ad jor parties, with former Labour MEPs Ken Coates (Nottinghamshire and Chesterfield) and Hugh Kerr (Essex West and Hertford\u00ad shire East, Greens) standing for other par\u00ad ties, while Christine Oddy (Coventry and North Warwickshire, PES), suspended from the par\u00ad ty last week, may stand as an independent. On the Conservative side, James Moor\u00ad house (London South and Surrey East), who defected to the Liberals, will not be stand\u00ad ing again, while John Stevens (Thames Val\u00ad ley, EPP) and Brendan Donnelly (Sussex South and Crawley, EPP) will be putting up a sep\u00ad arate pro\u00adEuropean Tory Party list that has at\u00ad tracted the support of former Conservative MEPs Andrew Pearce and Paul Howell.

        "Il COMMENT EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT- EP NEWS MAY 1999 Forward after Amsterdam - now it's time to vote THE ENTRY into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will not change the face of European politics overnight. In fact it is difficult to point to one single area where there will be a gi ant leap forward. Even the wording in the Treaty to allow the Commission President des ignate a say in the choice of his fellow Com missioners (\"The governments of the member states shall, by common accord with the nom inee for President, nominate the other persons whom they intend to appoint as members of the Commission\") illustrates how the drafters of the Treaty agonised over the details. It is carefully balanced to allow closer co operation, whether at the instigation of the Eu ropean institutions oron an inter-govemmental basis through the \"second\" and \"third\" pillars on Home Affairs and Foreign Policy. In fact it could be argued that placing the appoint ment of Mr/Mrs Foreign Affairs firmly in the hands of Council or the national governments takes the initiative away from the Commis sion. At the same time, there is provision for a role for the EU institutions on \"third pillar\" immigration, asylum and security questions. It is up to the European Union to take de cisions in the areas singled out for shared sovereignty or else it will lose even more credibility. Amsterdam is designed to push the decision makers in this direction but the failure of EU Ministers last month to agree a common plan for refugees in Kosovo shows that there is still a long way to go. The EU is still perceived as being remote from its citizens. The forthcoming election campaign offers an opportunity to change this. The Parliament, through its members, is the one institution that can develop links with the people, and the new election sys tem in Britain based on proportional repre sentation means that each vote counts in determining just who is to get elected. It is now the voter's duty to scrutinise the can didates and send to Strasbourg people who will respond to citizens' concerns. The European Parliament, by changing its rules of procedure, has already announced its intention to squeeze as much as possible from the Treaty. A simpler legislative process will make procedures less tortuous, while the re quirement, for example, for the new repre sentative for Foreign Affairs to appear before one of Parliament's committees will enhance transparency and accountability. The outcome can be filtered down to the public via the me dia, and - as can be seen with the resignation of the present Commission following pressure from the European Pari \u00a1ament - produce re sults. This shows that each vote does mat ter - it is now up to the electors to use it.

This month we look at the changes brought about by the Treaty and the implications for the European Parliament. Seals of approval: the Amsterdam Treaty, which is now in force, has wide ramifications for the EU Treaty will see extension of EU Parliament's legislative role T he Amsterdam Treaty strengthens the European Parliament's leg islative powers by improving the co-decision-making procedure and extending it to 15 existing treaty areas and eight new responsibilities. The procedure allows Parliament to table amendments through two readings of pro posals and, if considered appropriate, to re ject the Council of Ministers' final text. The system is also to be streamlined by allowing the adoption of uncontroversial legislation af ter the first reading and placing more of the blame on the Council of Ministers in the event of a failure to agree, since the proposal would lapse in the absence of a compromise between both sides. The old rules obliged Parliament to muster an absolute majority of members for a rejection vote. Although some of the Treaty areas, such as freedom of movement, where the co-de cision-making procedure will apply are not used extensively, it will affect decision mak ing in key areas such as transport, social pol icy, and rules relating to working conditions, the environment and development policy. Fur thermore, by providing for the procedure to apply to new policy competences such as em ployment, equal opportunities, public health and the environment, it firmly establishes the principle that when the EU takes on extra re sponsibilities, these will be undertaken in ac cordance with democratic principles. After five years, this will apply to some cross-border asylum issues such as visas, and there is to be a review of other asylum and immigration questions, with the possibility of co-decision making also applying here. The co-operation procedure, which also provides for Parliament to table amendments but at the end of the day still allows the Coun cil of Ministers to overrule Parliament, re mains for just four areas relating to economic and monetary union. The \"assent\" procedure, introduced in the Maastricht Treaty, which provides for MEPs to reject or approve international agreements, has been extended to just one area, that of the possibility of imposing sanctions on a member state persistently infringing human rights agreements. Consultation of the Eu ropean Parliament is now required for \"third pillar\" inter-governmental co-operation arrangements on home and justice affairs. Amsterdam treaty is 'citizen-friendly' THE EU and its institutions have often been accused of remoteness, and one of the aims of the Amsterdam Treaty is to reverse this trend. Any mention of citizens' rights and responsibilities is a delicate question where national sensitivities are acute. The treaty therefore emphasises that European citi zenship is complementary to national citi zenship. Amsterdam docs, however, confer the right to vote for European citizens in lo cal and European elections in the country where he or she is living. In addition, any individual is now allowed to take the European institutions to the Eu ropean Court of Justice over any action con sidered a breach of their fundamental rights. There is also a stronger commitment to tack ling sex and racial discrimination. In a related move to make the EU more citizen friendly, EU governments agreed that the Treaty should also include a commitment to a high level of public health, albeit on the understanding that this is to be seen to complement national policies. In addition, consumer protection receives a boost with a new commitment to take the consumer's needs into account when framing EU poli cies in general. Improving environmental protection is another area envisaged for an increased EU role, while in response to calls to remove the veil of secrecy which sometimes sur rounds EU decision making, the Council of Ministers is to open its doors to requests for information from the general public. In an ticipation of the new provisions, Council has already established a new documentation unit and the results of legislative votes in Council are to be made public.

Internet address is http:ltue.eu.int Promotion of employment and social policy THE INCLUSION of a chapter on em ployment in the Treaty of Amsterdam is a new approach: each member state will re tain control over its policy, but from now on will fit it into a co-ordinated European strategy, bringing the social and economic spheres together. As a result, promoting a high level of employment is now in black and white as one of the major objectives of the Union. A few new articles inserted into legal texts will obviously not be enough to create jobs. But obliging the member states to publish employment guidelines subject to a vote in Council will enable notes to be compared on the best practices and encourage Euro- wide discussions on tackling unemployment problems. These could tum out to be the missing elements in the battle to bring last ing improvements in the job situation. As the United Kingdom has now decid ed to join the Social Protocol, it has been incorporated into the Treaty's provisions on social policy, education, training and youth. This means that the Union can get to grips with wider-ranging problems such as the changes caused by new ways of organising production and work. Competitiveness, job creation, flexibil ity and job security are today's challenges, and the Treaty now includes a provision to take action in the fight against \"social ex clusion\", to help those living on the mar gins of society.

        "EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT- EP NEWS MAY 1999 NEWS III ins and making its institutions more efficient Tony Blair makes a memorable debut on the European stage at the Amsterdam summit of June 1997 Slowly, slowly - creating a common immigration and asylum policy T HE CRITICISM aimed at the British government in recent weeks for its refusal to accept larger numbers of Kosovan refugees highlights the absence of any real EU-wide policy on accepting refugees. Despite this, the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will result in no radical departures in the field of immigration and asylum policies. However, the Treaty does call for the stage-by-stage establishment of \"an area of freedom, security and justice\" across the EU and lays down specific mea sures to create a common European policy on controls over the EU's external borders, especially in the areas of managing the move ment of people and dealing with asylum seek ers and immigration questions. Specific subjects to be addressed include standard procedures for the issue and pro cessing of visas, and for dealing with both legal and illegal immigrants and refugees. However, these changes will not come about overnight, but during a period of five years from 1 May 1999. The legislative process will take place through the EU's standard \"first pillar\" route, which means greater involvement for Com mission and Parliament, rather than the in ter-governmental \"third pillar\" approach which takes more time, as anything major needs to be ratified by all 15 member-state national parliaments. Although on the sur face this will mean a speedier decision-mak ing process, any proposals will have to secure the agreement of all 15 member states. In five years' time. EU leaders can choose to amend this system so that deci sions can be taken by a qualified majority. However, once again all 15 national gov ernments would have to give the go-ahead to a change of that type. Immigration and asylum has always hccn an area in which national governments have jealously guard ed their prerogatives. Nevertheless, al though the changes that are to be implemented may not appear to be very far reaching, they do represent a step forward to \"communitarising\" decision-making in a field which has traditionally always been the preserve of national governments. However, in view of Council's failure last month to agree on a common plan for refugees, there is still along way to go. In deed Emma Bonino, the Acting Commis sioner for humanitarian aid, this month illustrated the Commission's dilemma by pointing out that although it was responsi ble for organising facilities for refugees from Kosovo, this was made difficult by not be ing informed of different plans by the na tional governments. See report, page IV New post gives 'human face' to EU defence identity IN RECENT years it has become clear that the economic might of the 15 member states is not matched by the political clout that the EU wields in the world arena. It is also be coming apparent that they would exert more influence if they spoke with one voice on specific matters and particular regions of the world where EU vital interests are at stake, such as Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and Baltic regions, rela tions with the United States and Russia, and in particular the conflict in the former Yu goslav republics. The Amsterdam Treaty includes a series of innovations in this field. Firstly it gives the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) a \"human face\" by creating a Sec retary General for the post who would play a similar role to that of the United Nations Secretary General. The new \"High Repre sentative\" will speak for Europe in world forums, which resolves the question posed by Henry Kissinger, who wondered whom Washington should contact in the EU on world policy issues. The High Representative will replace the current \"troika system\", which has meant that the EU has been represented on the world stage by its past, present and future hold ers of the Presidency. The individual will be appointed in June and will be supported by a policy planning and early warning unit which will enable an analysis to be made of potential conflict zones so that crisis sit uations can be anticipated. Names currently in the frame for the post include Paddy Ashdown, Chris Patten and the current NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana. Secondly, the EU will now be able to car ry out the \"humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making\", which are known as \"Pe tersberg tasks\", after the German town where agreement was reached on them. Even the traditionally neutral member states (Aus tria, Finland. Ireland and Sweden) have agreed to contribute to these missions as long as they do not call their non-aligned status into question. The Treaty also introduces the instrument of \"common strategies\". These will estab lish guidelines aimed at co-ordinating poli cies towards third countries in areas in which the member states have \"important interests in common\", such as the strategy current ly being developed towards Russia, which will be followed by a similar approach to wards Ukraine, the Mediterranean region and the western Balkans. These strategies will be decided by the Eu ropean Council of EU leaders. They can then be put into effect by qualified majority vote of the Council of Ministers. The use of \"con structive abstentions\", which will allow a member state to abstain in a vote of nation al sensitivity without blocking an otherwise unanimous decision, has been authorised. The Treaty does, however, leave many ar eas untouched and the EU is still a long way from having a true CFSP. However, Tom Spencer (Surrey, EPP), in a parliamentary re port on the issue, believes that the coming into force of the Treaty \"now offers hope\". Nevertheless, as he says, this will \"merely mark the beginning of the real process of determining whether the new Treaty provi sions are suitable for permanently enhanc ing the EU's foreign and security profile and whether the political will for this exists\". Parties target Euro elections A RECORD number of parties are set to con test the European Parliament elections in the UK on 10 June, the first to be decided on a system of proportional representation. While the final list of parties and candi dates will not be known until after Thurs day 13 May (the closing date for nominations), some 16 parties have already revealed their plans to stand in Britain. Par ties intending to run full slates include Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Greens, UK Independence, Pro Euro Con servatives, Socialist Labour, Natural Law, and the BNP. A number of smaller parties, including the Alternative Labour List/Left Alliance, Liberal, Socialist, Conservative De mocratic, and the Socialist Alliance will be contesting some of the nine electoral regions in England. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party will be hoping to repeat its success at the Scottish Parliament election, while in Wales, Plaid Cymru will be buoyed up by its break through in the Welsh Assembly. In Northern Ireland all the main parties in the Assembly will be fielding candidates. In all, 64 of the UK's MEPs will be seeking re-election on 10 June, while another EP Elections 10 June 1999 seven former MEPs will be hoping for a re turn to Strasbourg and Brussels. \u2022 Christine Oddy, MEP for Coventry and North Warwickshire has been dropped as a Labour candidate for the European Parlia ment elections. Last year Ms Oddy, who has been an MEP for 10 years, protested over the way Labour selected its candidates for the European elections after being placed last but one on Labour's list of eight candidates in the West Midlands, giving her very little chance of being re-elected.

Every year Mr Sch\u00e4fer spends a week of his holiday working unpaid in a different job so that he can get a better idea of the concerns of his constituents. In the past he has been a social worker, a bus driver, a miner, a steelworker and has held a posi tion in an old people's home. Recently he was the Prince of Carnival in his constituency in Westphalia, which involved making speeches and wearing exotic clothes be fitting a royal personage. He is also the au thor of a book on European athletics - one of his part-time interests - and is a collector of travel books and guides. Born in Frankfurt in 1952, Mr Sch\u00e4fer came into Parliament from a trade union background. He has been particularly vo cal on the issue of enlargement and is a member of the joint parliamentary com mittee which visits Poland twice a year. \"Poland is the key to the enlargement process,\" he has declared. His interest in Central and Eastern Eu rope goes back a long way, as he was particu larly affected by a visit in 1971 to what was then East Germany - an experience which convinced him of the need for reunification. He regularly vis its the eastern part of Germany to keep in touch with economic developments there. Mr Sch\u00e4fer is also active in the Institu tional Affairs Committee and believes that its influence was crucial to the success achieved by Parliament in gaining new pow ers through the Amsterdam Treaty. He also co-operates closely with his fellow Social ists in the German government on consti tutional issues. But perhaps his most important mission is to make Europe a re ality for its citizens for Otto and Erna Nor malverbraucher- or Mr and Mrs Average. ",
        "IV NEWS EUROPEAN PARUAMENT EP NEWS MAY 1999 Kosovan refugees - the EU must do more H umanitarian concerns were to the fore this month in Stras bourg when MEPs called for emergency aid for the Balkans to be stepped up in order to deal with the growing crisis in Kosovo. In addition to broad support for Nato ac tion and condemnation for the \"barbarities\" of President Milosevic, Council President German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer painted a grim picture of the situation in the region where, he said, there were now a to tal of 850,000 displaced persons. Some of these individuals were still in Kosovo where they faced the constant threat of at tacks by the Serbian army, and where they were short of food and medical supplies. Around 650,000 had fled to neighbouring countries which did not have the necessary facilities to house them and whose resources were stretched beyond their limit. Mr Fischer warned in particular of grow ing instability in Macedonia, where the del icate ethnic balance was being disturbed by the mass influx of refugees. Acting Commissioner Hans van den Broek responded with a promise of imme diate action. But as well as aid on the ground, MEPs also urged member states to take in more refugees as an \"exceptional and tem porary measure\". At present the burden of taking in refugees has not been equally shared between member states. Germany has already ac- Kosovan refugees arriving in the UK cepted over 10,000 individuals and has of fered to take at least a further 10,000. The British government has been criticised in the last month for not assuming its responsi bilities in this area, but recently it has promised to take in a larger share, with Home Secretary Jack Straw announcing that the UK would accept significantly greater numbers. Estimates still vary, but this might mean a total of 50,000 refugees entering the UK. Acting Commissioner Emma Bonino said that one of the problems being experienced was that each member state was acting uni laterally and not informing other states - or indeed the charities on the ground - of their plans, and this meant a duplication of countries' efforts. Another area of difficulty is that mem ber states interpret the legal status of the Kosovan refugees in different ways. This has resulted in a confusing patchwork of different protection regimes and widely differing le gal and social rights for Kosovan refugees staying in different member states. In some countries, such as the UK, they are entitled to work, whereas in others they are not. Fam ily reunification may be possible in some countries (though this is still unclear), while in countries such as France and the UK there are no family reunion rights. There have already been attempts by the European Parliament to develop an EU-wide strategy on refugees that would overcome some of these problems, and the Amsterdam Treaty may provide an opportunity for greater harmonisation of laws and policies. However, many feel that the political will to tackle the problem has been lacking to date and that this is not an issue where there can be dragging of feet. It is felt that many of the refugees would not survive a winter in their current accommodation. \u00a3462m extra funding for new URBAN regional aid programme Breakthrough on aid for urban regeneration WHILE APPROVING the new regional aid programme for the next seven years agreed by EU leaders at the March Berlin Summit, MEPs also persuaded the Council of Min isters to accept an additional \u00a3462m for Eu rope's run-down inner cities in a programme known as the URBAN initiative. \"If we are to make Europe relevant to lo cal people's needs, then we have to start pro grammes such as URBAN. Europe can make a difference to people's life opportunities in our most deprived inner-city areas. It requires sustained partnerships at local, national and European level, and the essential involve ment of the local community. Using the en ergy of the dispossessed and disaffected youth and the skills of the elderly will help us to replace poverty and social exclusion with partnership, allowing the regeneration and renaissance of our urban areas,\" said Ar- lene McCarthy (Peak District, PES), who is responsible for piloting the Regional Com mittee's report through the House and is in volved in the negotiations with EU Ministers. When the Commission published its proposals for the reform of the funds, UR BAN had been left out, and initially Coun cil was also not enthusiastic about the con tinuation of the Urban Community Initiative. Mrs McCarthy argued that as Commis sion and Council agreed that rural areas should continue to benefit from an initiative dedicated to rural regeneration, there should also be an initiative for urban areas. Eighty percent of European citizens live in cities and many suffer from significant problems of economic degradation and social deprivation. These areas are not always covered by mainstream EU assis tance programmes. It is estimated that 20 per cent of Europe's urban residents are - one way or another - excluded from the most basic economic and social facilities. From 1994-1999, the Urban Communi ty Initiative will have supported 49 urban areas across the 15 member states. Some 15 of these areas have unemployment rates of over 30 per cent. Too often the areas have displayed high incidences of crime, drug problems, pover ty, low educational achievement and high Moss Side in Manchester has benefited from EU aid levels of youth unemployment. In the UK. such areas include Netherton in Liverpool. North Huyton in Merseyside, and Moss Side and Hulme in Manchester, all of which have benefited from over \u00a333m from the EU Ur ban programme alone. Projects to benefit included: the 'Mil lennium Pow House' in Moss Side, a youth centre encouraging 16-year-olds back into education', local community safety schemes; a childcare activity centre; and sports coach ing for 16-year-olds. MEPs vote to crack down on junk e-mail THIS MONTH, MEPs voted for curbs on the unsolicited transmission of e-mails, known as \"spamming\". One member, Gra ham Watson (Somerset and North Devon, ELDR), complained that in one week alone he received 42 unwanted e-mails and, what was worse, the cost of receiving them was added to his own telephone bill. Such un wanted transmissions were, he contended, cost ing Britain and Irish businesses \u00a35 bn a year. Parliament's vote took the form of an amendment to a Commission proposal to lay down guidelines for the use of the Internet for electronic shopping. It was, said Christine Oddy (Coventry and North Warwickshire, PES), who was responsible for piloting the legislation through the House, vital to strength en consumer protection to guard against shop pers falling prey to rogue companies, especially when paying for purchases by credit card. The idea is to set up a register to allow Internet users to opt out of receiving junk e-mails. Another concern was the sale and pro motion of food supplements or health claims for new drugs. Parliament voted to strength en provisions relating to the liability of com panies engaged in sales on the Internet. In a related move, MEPs approved an other piece of legislation designed to improve buyers' rights in the event of cross-border sales. This time the aim is to protect con sumers shopping around for cheap mort gages, insurance or other financial services. The legislation arises from demands for change from MEPs, following high-profile cases of fraud, with investors left with no means of redress after purchasing dubious investments from companies registered in other countries. The legislation plugs a gap in the EU cross-frontier legal area and will protect consumers from fraud and misleading advertising in the financial services sector. And in a charged session, MEPs also fi nalised another piece of consumer protection legislation, this time on guarantees for prod ucts bought in another country. The new di rective, to come into force by 1 January 2002, will entitle purchasers of goods to free re pairs or replacement for defective products. Media ownership of football clubs under investigation APPEARING FOR the last time before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Acting Competition Policy Commissioner Karel Van Miert told MEPs that the question of media own ership of football clubs and broadcast ing rights would continue to be investigated by the Commission's com petition policy department. Van Miert acknowledged that the next challenge was to formulate a strategy to deal with the role of the Internet, fol lowing reports of a takeover bid by Bill Gates for Dynamo Kiev. At present, he said, the Commission was considering requests from the Bun desliga and UEFA on the new Champi ons League, for \"collective selling rights\" for broadcasting television matches under their respective juris dictions. He also made it clear that the Commission's decision on whether to grant the organisation exclusive rights will not just be made on commercial grounds but take into account other fac tors, such as solidarity with less wealthy clubs, along with related measures, in cluding setting aside funds for training young footballers. On the related issue of ticket sales for next year's European Football Champi onships to be held in Belgium and Hol land, Mr Van Miert promised MEPs that there would not be a repeat of the fias co with regard to ticket sales for the last World Cup and that measures had been taken to ensure that tickets would be freely available for supporters. Yes to closer links with Russia EVENTS IN Kosovo have brought Russia back to the centre stage as a mediator be tween Nato and Serbia. In addition, the ex pressions of disquiet coming from Moscow about the Nato bombardment have remind ed Western leaders that Russia cannot be side lined - it is still a military superpower. It was therefore an appropriate time for the House to be debating the report by Tom Spencer (Surrey, EPP) on a common strategy - an EU-wide approach - towards Russia, as this is an area where member states have much in common. One point of contention was that Par liament had not been consulted about the common strategy, and Mr Spencer wanted to ensure that in future the Council of Min isters would involve MEPs, as he argued that this was a fundamental element of the com mon foreign and security policy. Never theless, in this instance the House decided not to recommend a delay in the adoption of the strategy as it was felt that to do so would send out the wrong message to Rus sia at what is a sensitive time. In the debate MEPs recognised the problems faced by Russia in its economic and political transition from a \"hyper-cen tralised state, dominated by a single party, to a more decentralised state\". Peter Truscott (PES, Hertfordshire) argued that it was the EU's duty to work with Russia to help it overcome its problems but that Moscow must also do more itself to improve its sit uation, and that political will was necessary to defeat \"robber baron capitalism\". There was strong support for Russian d\u00e9 mocratisation and economic reform, and recognition that Russia might fear being side lined with the expansion of Nato to incor porate former Warsaw Pact countries. Acting Commissioner Hans van den Broek wel comed the House's support and hoped that the common strategy would be approved at the forthcoming summit in Cologne. Green light for the fraudbusters IN THE aftermath of the allegations of se rious irregularities within the Commission that led to the mass resignation of the Com missioners, MEPs this month gave the go- ahead to a revamped and strengthened EU anti-fraud office. Herbert Bosch (A. PES) saw the creation of the new office as a ma jor step forward in the fight against \"fraud, mismanagement and cronyism\". The new EU anti-fraud office will have a similar status to the Serious Fraud Office in the UK and will be known as OLAF, after its French initials (\"Office de lutte anti- fraude\"). OLAF will take over all the tasks of its predecessor UCLAF, but will have a much wider remit. It will, for example, be able to look into all kinds of irregularities, such as tampering with staff appointments or the tendering of contracts. The head of OLAF will be obliged to forward directly to the political authorities anything that could be open to criminal charges, and staff in the EU institutions will also have an obligation to report to OLAF details of any possible case of fraud or other illegal activities. Most importantly, although it is organ isationally located within the Commis sion. OLAF will enjoy complete operational independence. Indeed, the OLAF director will be free to open investigations on his own initiative and. if he feels he is being obstructed by the Commission in any aspect of his work, he will now be able to pursue the matter with the European Court of Justice. In answer to the question, \"Who guards the guards?\", OLAF's work will be subject to outside monitoring by indepen dent experts. If all goes well with the various out standing procedures for approving the new office it should be up and running before the end of the current year. It will be part of a culture, said German Minister Karl Diller for the Council, which shows \"zero toler ance for fraud\". "
