( 2 ) OJ L 96, 12.4.2003, p. 16. Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "\u2014 having regard to the CPSS and IOSCO recommendations for central counterparties of November 2004, \u2014 having regard to the concept release of the Securities and Exchanges Commission on Equity Market Structure (No. 34-61358; File No. S7-02-10), \u2014 having regard to the CESR technical advice to the European Commission in the context of the MiFID review and responses to the European Commission request for additional information (Ref: CESR/10- 802, Ref: CESR/10-799, Ref: CESR/10-808, Ref: CESR/10-859, Ref: CESR/10-860), \u2014 having regard to Rule 48 of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (A7-0326/2010), A. whereas the G20 set out that no financial institution, no financial product and no territory should remain outside the scope of intelligent regulation and effective supervision and agreed that all stan\u00ad dardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, B. whereas the lack of transparency and the accompanying opacity of risk patterns in the financial system was an aggravating factor in the financial crisis, facilitating the spread of general distrust and thereby contributing to drastically reduced liquidity flows, C. whereas consumer protection, transparency, particularly as regards the price formation process, efficient and liquid markets and competition on a level playing field were the key objectives when MiFID came into force, but have not yet been achieved and must therefore remain a priority; whereas, following the financial crisis, limiting systemic risk must also be prioritised in the review of MiFID, D. whereas changes to MiFID should always take into account its importance in governing capital flows into the real economy and therefore the potential impact on jobs, investments and pensions, E. whereas up to 40 % of trading volume is still carried out OTC; whereas market participants should be encouraged to transact more on organised trading venues, F. whereas the inclusion in the MIFID of waivers to pre-trade transparency requirements and the estab\u00ad lishment of MTF and dark pools were intended to facilitate a shift towards more regulated and trans\u00ad parent venues, G. whereas MiFID defines OTC trading as having the characteristics of being ad hoc and irregular, carried out with wholesale counterparties, and being part of a business relationship which is itself characterised by dealings above standard market size and where the deals are carried out outside the systems usually used by the firm concerned for its business as a systematic internaliser, H. whereas despite the provision in MiFID of waivers to allow dark trading on organised markets, the establishment of MTFs and Systematic Internalisers (SIs) and the definition of OTC trades as being irregular and ad hoc, OTC trades not carried out on an SI basis continue to account for a high proportion of equities trading at 38 % of all reported trades according to CESR/10-394, and whereas this proportion has not declined since the implementation of MiFID; whereas tighter and more effective enforcement of MiFID rules and waivers should therefore be ensured, I. whereas market fragmentation in equities trading has had an undesired impact upon liquidity and market efficiency owing to a decrease in transparency based on an increase in dark pools and crossing networks, the effect of an increased number of venues both in the on-exchange and off-exchange space, and increasingly technology-driven trading, and has decreased average transaction size from EUR 22 266 in 2006 to EUR 9 923 in 2009, increasing the total cost of transactions for some users, EN C 169 E/2 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "J. whereas the decrease in transaction size has led to a reduction in the capacity of market participants to instantly execute large orders on a particular market and the desire to prevent market impact for large orders has encouraged the expansion of dark-pool trading; whereas less than 10 % of all trading in EEA equities shares on organised markets use the MiFID pre-trade transparency waivers (CESR/10-394), whereas these MiFID waivers allows for dark-pool trading as a more transparent and better regulated alternative to dark trading in the OTC space but whereas the absence of sufficient regulation for OTC transactions, including Broker Crossing Networks, provides a competitive advantage to the OTC space and encourages an increase in trading in the dark, undermining market transparency in general; whereas in total around half of trades are currently not covered by pre-trade transparency requirements, but half of OTC transactions are below market size and therefore do not require protection against market impact, K. whereas, to ensure a level playing field, broker crossing networks (BCNs) should be subject to an in- depth investigation of their business models, to ensure that where they provide services which mean they are essentially functioning as regulated markets (RMs), multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) or as Systematic Internalisers they are regulated as such, L. whereas the benefits of competition in terms of more competitive and innovative trading infrastructure has not been proved, as the total transaction costs have not been reduced, and opacity has increased, while at the same time it is clear that quality and integrity for all participants in a more fragmented market are not properly guaranteed, M. whereas given that HFT claims to provide liquidity to financial markets it would be useful to determine whether there are risks associated with electronic order systems and the significant share of trading volumes attributable to HFT strategies, estimated at 70 % in the US, particularly in view of the conclusions of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the US \u2018flash crash\u2019 on 6 May 2010 when HFT liquidity providers exited the market, N. whereas HFT strategies are a relatively new phenomenon in Europe and are now estimated to make up 35 % of the market by volume, O. whereas greater transparency via pre- and post-trade reporting of trading activity across all asset classes should be established in order to provide improved early warning of the build-up and scale of developing problems, as well as to improve the efficiency of the price formation process and foster trust between market actors, P. whereas the G20 decisions of 24 and 25 September 2009 in Pittsburgh stated that \u2018all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms\u2019, Q. whereas divergence of implementation between Member States has led to an incomplete application of the MiFID framework, MIFID Trading Venues 1. Recognises that market infrastructures have been resilient throughout the crisis and calls upon the Commission to nonetheless strengthen market infrastructures across all trading venues and clearing systems to enable them to cope with future risk through enhanced transparency, improved resilience and regulatory oversight of all aggregated trades; 2. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories as a necessary prerequisite for increasing transparency and safety within the markets in financial instruments and regards it as the first step towards shifting the significant proportions of OTC trade to trade venues subject to MIFID regulation; 3. Suggests that, in the interests of equitable treatment, MTFs should be subject to the same level of supervision as, and therefore regulated in a comparable way to, competition between MTFs and that RMs should happen on a level playing field, while noting the important role of MTFs for market entry; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/3 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "4. Asks for ESMA to conduct an investigation into the functioning and purpose of the Systematic Internaliser (SI) regime and the bringing forward of improvements to the way in which this category is regulated in order to ensure that this regime is used for execution of orders on a bilateral basis with the financial counterparty; 5. Demands that investment firms which provide a portfolio management service and act in a portfolio management capacity must be provided with best execution by the investment firms with whom they place orders, notwithstanding the fact that the portfolio manager is categorised by MiFID as an eligible counter\u00ad party; 6. Calls for ESMA to conduct a review of whether order-by-order best execution needs to be better served by regulation in relation to the availability of data, both post-trade and in relation to execution quality, and in relation to market technology, such as order routers and venue connections; 7. Calls for thorough enforcement of the provisions in MIFID in order to ensure that BCNs that are carrying out activities equivalent to an RM, MTF or SI are regulated as such, and, in order to facilitate this enforcement, insists that all BCNs should be required to submit to the competent authorities all necessary information including: \u2014 a description of the system, ownership and clients, \u2014 details on access to the system, \u2014 orders matched in the system, \u2014 trading methodologies and broker discretion, \u2014 arrangements for immediate post-trade reporting; 8. Asks for an investigation into OTC trading of equities and calls for improvements to the way in which OTC trading is regulated with a view to ensuring that the use of RMs and MTFs in the execution of orders on a multilateral basis and of SIs in the execution of orders on a bilateral basis increases, and that the proportion of equities trading carried out OTC declines substantially; 9. Asks for an investigation by the Commission into the effects of setting a minimum order size for all dark transactions, and whether it could be rigorously enforced so as to maintain adequate flow of trade through the lit venues in the interests of price discovery; Pre-Trade Transparency Waivers 10. Calls on the Commission to conduct a review of the existing MiFID pre-trade transparency waivers to: \u2014 consider whether a suitable minimum threshold should be introduced for the Reference Price waiver to encourage the use of lit venues, \u2014 consider broadening the Reference Price waiver to include trades that fall within the current spread in the reference market, \u2014 introduce a maximum volume of transactions that could use pre-trade transparency waivers in order to guarantee efficient price discovery, EN C 169 E/4 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "\u2014 give ESMA the possibility of adapting and restricting pre-trade waivers as necessary, taking into account the impact of dark trading on the efficiency of markets; 11. Asks for a uniform application of pre-trade waivers across Member States to limit implementing differences that can lead to uncertainty, regulatory arbitrage and an uneven playing field; suggests that technical standards defined by ESMA could be an appropriate way of achieving this, in keeping with the concept of a single rule book for financial services; Consolidated Tape 12. Welcomes the recent announcement by market participants that they will be unbundling their pre- and post-trade data, and calls for further efforts towards common data standards and better availability of data; 13. Calls on the Commission to establish a working group to overcome the difficulties preventing the consolidation of market data in Europe and particularly the poor quality of reporting data across all transactions; 14. Calls upon ESMA to draw up common reporting standards and formats for the reporting of all post- trade data, both on organised trading venues and OTC, to aid in data consolidation; 15. Asks that all reporting venues be required to unbundle post-trade data from pre-trade data so information can be made available to all market participants at a commercially reasonable and comparable cost; further, asks the Commission to consider the introduction of Approved Publication Arrangements (APAs) in order to introduce quality standards for trade publication and reduce the number of venues that trades can be reported to, as well as the use of internet pages, which are an obstacle to consolidation; 16. Calls for a reduction in the time limit for deferred publication so transactions are reported to the regulators within twenty-four hours of taking place; takes the view, with regard to publication of trans\u00ad actions, that in ordinary circumstances delays of more than one minute should be considered unacceptable; 17. Deems that it is essential to analyse the breakdown and business models of OTC trading, and therefore calls for the introduction of specific flags in pre- and post-trade transparency for OTC trades with a view to further understanding the characteristics of such OTC trades and assessing which types of transaction can legitimately be done OTC owing to their specific characteristics; Micro-structural issues 18. Insists that post-\u2018flash crash\u2019, all trading platforms must be able to demonstrate to national super\u00ad visors that their technology and surveillance systems are able to withstand the kind of barrage of orders experienced on 6 May 2010 so as to ensure that they could successfully deal with the activity associated with HFT and algorithmic trading in extreme circumstances and show that they are able to re-create their order books by end of day so that causes of unusual market activity can be pinpointed and any suspected market abuse identified; 19. Calls on ESMA to conduct an examination of the costs and benefits of algorithmic and high- frequency trading (HFT) on markets and its impact upon other market users, particularly institutional investors, to determine whether the significant market flow generated automatically is providing real liquidity to the market and what effect this has on overall price discovery, as well as the potential for abuses by manipulation of the market leading to an uneven playing field between market participants, and its impact on overall market stability; 20. Calls for the practice of \u2018layering\u2019 or \u2018quote stuffing\u2019 to be explicitly defined as market abuse; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/5 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "21. Calls for an investigation into whether to regulate firms that pursue HFT strategies in order to ensure that they have robust systems and controls with ongoing regulatory reviews of the algorithms they use, the capacity for intra-day monitoring and interrogation about real-time outstanding positions and leverage, and the ability to demonstrate that they have strong management procedures in place for abnormal events; 22. Calls for an examination of HFT\u2019s challenges in terms of market monitoring; recognises the need for regulators to have the appropriate means to detect and monitor potential abusive behaviour; with this in mind, calls for the reporting to the competent authorities of all orders received by regulated markets and MTFs, as well as of trades done on these platforms; 23. Calls for all trading venues allowing co-location of servers, whether directly or through third-party data providers, to ensure that equal access for all co-located clients is maintained and where possible under the same infrastructure latency arrangements in order to comply with non-discriminatory practice outlined in MiFID; 24. Calls upon regulators to monitor and regulate the provision of sponsored access and upon the Commission to consider additional measures including: \u2014 expressly prohibiting unfiltered sponsored access to companies, regardless of whether they belong to the same corporate group as the sponsor, \u2014 requiring broker-dealers and investment firms to establish, document and maintain a system of risk- management controls, pre- and post-trade, and supervisory procedures to manage the financial, regu\u00ad latory and other risks related to its market access; 25. Calls, notwithstanding the necessary application of safeguards, for ESMA to further investigate whether sponsored access crosses the threshold of non-discriminatory access; 26. Calls on the Commission to adopt the principles being developed by the Technical Committee of IOSCO on direct electronic access, including sponsored access, which will cover the criteria for selecting clients who can be given sponsored access and the contractual relationship between the platform, the member and the client and will outline their respective responsibilities regarding their use with suitable controls and filters; 27. Takes the view that, in order to comply with the principle that all investors should be treated equally, the practice of flash orders should be explicitly ruled out; 28. Calls for an investigation by ESMA into fee structures to ensure that execution fees, ancillary fees, investment firms\u2019 commission fees, and any other related incentives are transparent, non-discriminatory and consistent with reliable price formation and are designed and implemented so as not to encourage trading for improper purposes and to assess whether a minimal charge should be paid by users posting orders, whether these orders are executed or not, as these orders need to be processed by the market infrastructure; 29. Suggests ESMA conduct a study of the maker/taker fee model to determine whether any recipient of the more favourable \u2018maker\u2019 fee structure should also be subject to formal market maker obligations and supervision; 30. Asks for ESMA supervision and definition by implementing acts of robust volatility interrupts and circuit breakers which operate simultaneously across all EU trading venues in order to prevent a US-style \u2018flash crash\u2019 event; EN C 169 E/6 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "Scope 31. Requests that no unregulated market participant be able to gain direct or unfiltered sponsored access to formal trading venues and that significant market participants trading on their own account be required to register with the regulator and allow their trading activities to be subject to an appropriate level of supervision and scrutiny for stability purposes; 32. Calls for proprietary trading activities conducted via algorithmic trading strategies by unregulated entities to be transacted solely through a regulated financial counterparty; 33. Calls for the extension of the scope of the MiFID transparency regime to all \u2018equity-like\u2019 instruments including depository receipts (DRs), exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded commodities (EDCs) and certificates; 34. Asks the Commission and ESMA to consider introducing a transparency requirement, pre- and post- trade, on all non-equity financial instruments, including government and corporate bond markets and CCP eligible derivatives, to be applied in a manner that differentiates across asset classes where appropriate and at the same time combines with measures that bring about further standardisation of OTC derivative products in order to enable greater application of transparency; 35. Takes the view, taking into account the issues that have been experienced in relation to data quality and consolidation of post-trade data for European equities, that the Commission should ensure that post- trade data for non-equity products are provided in a form which is readily consolidated; 36. Supports the Commission\u2019s intention to apply a wider range of MiFID provisions to derivative instruments, as the trading of such products moves increasingly to organised trading venues and is subject to increasing standardisation and central clearing requirements; 37. Calls for a proposal from the Commission to ensure that all OTC derivative contracts that can be standardised are traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, in order to ensure that the price of such contracts is formed in a transparent, fair and efficient manner, free from conflict of interest; 38. Requests a review of the IOSCO standards for clearing houses, securities settlement systems and systemically important payment systems with a view to improve further market transparency; 39. Believes that it is necessary for regulators across the different physical and financial commodities markets to have access to the same data in order to identify trends and cross linkages, and calls on the Commission to coordinate efforts both within the EU and globally; * * * 40. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission and to the European Central Bank.

Points out, however, that the implementation of the common CBRN security system should not reduce the competence of the Member States in this policy area; 3. Considers that the action plan will play a key role in ensuring the smooth interaction of national and European initiatives in addressing CBRN risks; 4. Acknowledges that it is crucial to leverage the competent expertise and avoid duplication, fragmen\u00ad tation and inconsistency in the EU institutions\u2019 and/or the Member States\u2019 efforts in the security and defence areas where the fundamental right to life is at risk and where the implications of carelessness and laxity know no borders; 5. Stresses that the EU should strengthen its common approach to CBRN prevention, detection and response through the creation of specific mechanisms (regulatory, legislative or non-legislative instruments) which make cooperation and the provision of means of assistance compulsory in the event of a CBRN disaster caused by an accident or terrorist attack; recalls that the main objective of the EU institutions should be to ensure the efficiency of a national or transnational response to a CBRN accident or terrorist attack, on the basis of EU solidarity, in a coordinated manner under the auspices of the Commission and with a pan- European outreach; 6. Recalls that an EU CBRN Action Plan offers an opportunity to enable the EU and its Member States to find the legislative means to effectively implement the Solidarity Clause included in Article 222 TFEU, and that Member States must be informed of each others\u2019 plans and best practices to deal with and counter CBRN disasters, whether caused accidentally or intentionally, so that they can come to each others\u2019 assistance in a coordinated and effective manner; 7. Stresses that it is essential to strengthen the scope for normative and regulatory intervention by the Commission, which in the present version of the EU CBRN Action Plan is afforded a somewhat vague role in connection with many of the goals and actions provided for; consequently, urges that the Commission should issue legislative proposals, as far as possible, in all areas covered by the Action Plan; and stresses that only if a robust regulatory role is entrusted to the Commission can gaps in the efforts developed by each Member State be filled; 8. Urges that the commitment of the Member States to CBRN control must go further than the simple sharing of best practices and information, and that technologies and infrastructures should also be pooled/ shared, so as to avoid duplication and waste of resources, in order to create valuable and cost-effective synergies at EU level; calls on the Member States to agree on methods for the detection and prevention of CBRN disasters, the transferral of CBRN materials within the EU and response measures, including sharing of CBRN-related information and cross-border assistance; 9. Encourages, therefore, the most advanced Member States in the field of internal security, despite its vulnerable and quintessentially national nature, to share their information, technologies and infrastructures and launch joint strategic projects as referred to above; calls on the Commission and Council to create and regularly update a database of the medical countermeasures that are available in the Member States to respond to CBRN incidents, to encourage the sharing of existing capacities and to coordinate a cost-efficient policy for the acquisition of such countermeasures; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/13 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Calls for EU quality and security standards, as well as an EU system and network of laboratories for the certification of CBRN security equipment and technologies, to be developed; underlines that strict security standards and hiring procedures also need to apply to personnel employed at facilities with access to harmful agents; calls for the sharing and use of best knowledge and expertise from both the civil and military fields; again under the leadership of the Commission, stresses that the necessary research and development funding should be provided to ensure that applied research and major demonstration programmes with an EU dimension are carried out, and, given the fragmentation of this market, that an EU industrial policy in the field of civil security is needed, stimulating cooperation between enterprises in the EU and with specific support for small and medium-sized enterprises/small and medium-sized industries (SMEs/SMIs), which create a significant share of innovation under the FP7/Security, which should be increased, and that efforts should be made to stimulate cooperation (particularly cross-border cooperation) between European enterprises; wishes to see the emergence of a comprehensive project management capability to manage all aspects of CBRN security projects, covering the entire life cycle of the CBRN threat (prevention, detection and response); calls on the Commission to propose a strategy for developing the biodefence industry in Europe; 11. Welcomes the fact that CBRN protection is being addressed as a topic under the established European Framework Cooperation (EFC) for Security and Defence Research between the Commission, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA); stresses that complementarity, coordination and synergy between defence R&T investment and research investment for civilian security by the Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme would require genuine improvements in the relevant legal conditions governing the exchange of information within the EFC and between activities at national and EU level, as provided for by Council Decision 2006/971/EC of 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme Cooperation implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013) ( 1 ); calls for the development of applied research with a European dimension concerning the safety of installations, in order to protect local communities and the environment, and for the launching of major demonstration programmes; encourages the creation of centres of expertise specialising in CBRN threats and mobility for researchers; 12. Insists on the implementation of suitable safeguards and security measures when dealing with pooled databases of Member States and sensitive research data, as such a focus on security of data will encourage greater cooperation and sharing of information amongst Member State authorities and bodies; 13. Stresses the importance of enhanced preparedness, and calls for regular mapping of national capa\u00ad bilities and assets, as well as joint exercises among Member States; 14. Calls for the urgent establishment of a European crisis-response mechanism, based in the Commis\u00ad sion's services, which should coordinate civilian and military means so as to ensure that the EU has a rapid- response capability to deal with a CBRN disaster; and reiterates its call for the establishment of a European civil protection force based on the existing EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which will enable the Union to bring together the resources necessary for providing emergency assistance, including humanitarian aid, within 24 hours of a CBRN disaster inside or outside EU territory; stresses that suitable bridges and partnerships should also be built between bodies such as Europol, Interpol and law-enforcement authorities in the Member States with a view to creating an appropriate and effective network for proactive antici\u00ad pation/real-time monitoring of emergencies and operational engagement/coordination to deal with CBRN- related disasters, and stresses the need to report to the Commission as well; recalls the 2006 Barnier report entitled \u2018For a European civil protection force: Europe aid\u2019 ( 2 ) which Parliament strongly supported, and welcomes in that regard the new willingness by the Commission to create a European Emergency Response Capacity, as stated in the Commission Communication entitled \u2018Towards a stronger European disaster response: the role of civil protection and humanitarian assistance\u2019 (COM(2010)0600); EN C 169 E/14 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 ( 1 ) OJ L 400, 30.12.2006, p. 86.

Calls for dual-use civil-military technologies to be exploited as a source of synergies; within well- defined strategic collaboration frameworks, encourages cooperation with the EDA, NATO countries, such as the United States and Canada, and third countries which are pioneers in the field of CBRN security, through the exchange of good practices, structured dialogues between experts and joint capacity development; stresses the importance of the EU Member States\u2019 carrying out joint exercises in preventing and tackling CBRN security incidents, with the participation of the Member States\u2019 armed forces and civil protection forces and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism; 16. Notes that the existing EU Civil Protection Mechanism, as defined in Council Decision 2007/779/EC, is currently the appropriate instrument to deal with CBRN disasters, and stresses that this structure should be the forum where emergency decisions concerning CBRN disaster preparedness and response should be taken; notes, however, that in order to achieve this goal and to ensure proper prevention and detection, cooperation must be established with civil protection bodies, with the intelligence and law-enforcement authorities, as well as with security-service, military information and response centres in each of the Member States and at EU level, such as the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) of the Political and Security Committee (PSC) and the Joint Situation Centre (SitCen); recalls, further, the role of the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI), which is tasked with facilitating, promoting and strengthening operational cooperation among the relevant national authorities of the Member States in the field of internal security; 17. Recalls that the Joint Situation Centre (SitCen) has been placed within the new External Action Service, and that its personnel come mainly from the Member States\u2019 intelligence and police services; stresses that its role is of the utmost importance in supporting national crisis management centres; 18. Calls on the Member States to coordinate their efforts, under the supervision of the Commission, in order to enhance the interoperability of equipment, capabilities and technologies in the field of civil protection so as to efficiently put into practice the new solidarity clause in the event of a CRBN disaster; 19. Stresses that the strengthening of the EU\u2019s civil protection capacity must include besides the explo\u00ad ration of dual-use technologies, infrastructures and capabilities, as well the strategic cooperation with the EDA, as referred to above, the ESA, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and other international CBRN centres or programmes of excellence; 20. Urges the Member States to appoint or create a national authority which, in the event of a CBRN attack or disaster, would be tasked with the responsibility of acting as the main coordinator of all the national and local bodies involved, and of all the counter measures taken to respond to such an event; 21. Endorses the assessment that CBRN attacks are a serious threat to the security of people living in the EU; therefore supports all measures which offer greater protection against CBRN attacks; 22. Emphasises that the fight against terrorism must be conducted with full respect for international human rights law and European fundamental rights law, principles and values, including the principle of the rule of law; recalls the need to respect the principles of the Aarhus Convention on public access to information, participation and judicial review in matters relating to the environment; 23. Recalls that preventing terrorist access to CBRN materials is a key priority under both the current 2005 EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the future one, as well as under the 2003 EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Means of Delivery; requests, therefore, that the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator report regularly to Parliament, through the appropriate and relevant EU EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/15 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Urges the EU institutions to maintain democratic scrutiny of and transparency regarding the devel\u00ad opment and implementation of all parts of the EU CBRN Action plan, respecting the public's right to access to all information and relevant documentation that concerns public security and the everyday risks associated with CBRN disasters; 25. Calls for the mainstreaming of the measures provided for in the CBRN Action Plan in all the EU\u2019s external relations instruments for economic cooperation and political dialogue with third countries (including in the EU\u2019s non-proliferation clauses); urges the Commission and Council, in their political and economic dialogue with third countries, to use all available means (including Common Foreign and Security Policy and external relations instruments) to promote standards for the detection and prevention, including information sharing, and response to CBRN incidents in third countries, as outlined in the Action Plan; 26. Stresses the close link and mirror effect between security inside and security outside the European Union; welcomes, in this regard, the actions taken by CBRN regional centres of excellence in flashpoints outside the European Union with the aim of encouraging expertise networks, improving the capacity to control exports and prevent illegal trafficking in CBRN substances, and strengthening the regulatory arsenal available to these countries and regional cooperation in this field; encourages the idea of providing training in Europe for international experts from countries at risk in respecting the necessary security and confiden\u00ad tiality rules; 27. Urges the EU institutions and Member States to resist pressure from industry and other interested stakeholders seeking to escape the burden of more regulation, as is to be expected (and as emerges clearly from a comparison between the Commission and the Council versions of the EU CBRN Action Plan); considers that industry concerns about the quality and impact of the proposed regulatory measures should be taken into consideration, without losing sight of what is at stake, namely the rights to life, liberty and security of all people in Europe and their societies; stresses the priority of ensuring supervision and protection of CBRN materials throughout the EU and the efficiency of the EU response to a disaster, be it accidental or intentional and the importance of working towards the elimination of such threats; 28. Calls on the Member States to participate fully in the implementation phases of the EU CBRN Action Plan, cooperating in this respect with the EU bodies that are translating the goals and actions of the Action Plan into concrete steps, so that CBRN security is guaranteed in each of EU Member States; Prevention 29. Calls on the Commission to act as the main facilitator and monitor in connection with the estab\u00ad lishment and regular updating of EU lists on CBRN agents, whereby the Commission should be the one to decide on a reasonable timeframe; insists that the lists should also include possible preventive and response measures for each CBRN agent, in accordance with its level of dangerousness and potential for malicious use and vulnerability; 30. Takes the view that the EU CBRN Action Plan must set risk-based higher standards where security assessment criteria for high-risk CBRN facilities are concerned, and stresses the role and responsibility of national authorities to carry out regular checks of these facilities since the development of \u2018criteria\u2019, as stated in the current Action Plan amended and adopted by the Council, is in itself simply not enough and sets an EN C 169 E/16 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Stresses that security arrangements and requirements at high-risk CBRN facilities throughout the EU must be the subject of EU regulations, rather than merely \u2018good-practice documents\u2019, through a consistent consultation process bringing together EU bodies, Member State authorities and organisations dealing with high-risk CBRN agents; urges that until such regulations are adopted and in place, a greater monitoring and inspection role should be entrusted to the Commission; 32. Welcomes the initiatives of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in supporting IAEA programmes and nuclear inspections; recommends that measures should be taken to pool its databases and research findings with those of the Member States; 33. Supports the drawing-up of strategies to raise awareness among enterprises, the scientific and university community and financial institutions of the risks linked to the proliferation and trafficking of CBRN material in the context of their work and activities; takes the view, in more general terms, that confidentiality is a vital component of the effectiveness of certain security measures in the action plan, and that it is important to guard against any risk of disclosure that could render them ineffective; 34. Believes that the Commission and Member State authorities should oversee the activities carried out by the organisations dealing with high-risk CBRN materials and should ensure that these organisations comply with risk-based security and public safety standards, which implies that proper inspections of high- risk sites must be carried out regularly; 35. Considers that the \u2018Prevention\u2019 part of the EU CBRN Action Plan should be amended in such a way as to ensure that the chemicals industry replaces the use of high-risk chemicals with suitable lower-risk alternatives, where such replacement is scientifically, technologically and environmentally possible and there is a clear increase in security; recognises the economic costs such replacement may entail and their impact on the relevant industries, but urges the EU, the Member States and the private sector to put the safety of EU citizens first; recommends, in this connection, that a specific link should be established with the existing REACH Regulation ( 1 ), something which the version of the Action Plan proposed by the Commission rightly sought to do; calls on the Commission to deliver a study on the implementation of the REACH Regulation in this respect; 36. Stresses that the greatest CBRN risks stem from the proliferation of CBRN material by terrorists; stresses, therefore, the importance of making international control regimes more effective, and of improving border and export controls; 37. Calls on the Council and the Commission to urge all Member States to sign and to meet their commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and to do their utmost to promote the Additional Verification Protocol to the BWC, which includes lists of dangerous biological agents and pathogens and provisions on disclosure statements and monitoring inspections; also urges the Member States, the Council, the Commission and the international community to draw up, as part of the Verification Annex to the CWC, a list of all potentially harmful chemical substances, including white phosphorus; 38. Calls, further, on the Commission and the Council to continue to step up activities in support of the treaty system, in particular the conventions on chemical and biological weapons, therefore calling on all EU Member States to impose a strict ban on the production and use of biological and chemical weapons and to disarm their own weapons; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/17 ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1).

Calls on the Commission to present comparative data and an overall assessment of the state of play in industries in Europe when it comes to securing and increasing control over high-risk CBRN materials, including an overview of all relevant national laws regarding implementation of the CWC, the BWC and other international instruments related to CBRN materials; that overview should include reporting on the degree to which Member States and industries fulfil their international obligations; recognises, nevertheless, that enforcement measures, such as the BWC and CWC, might be insufficient to tackle the risks stemming from CBRN use by non-state actors, namely by terrorist networks; 41. Calls on the Council and the Commission to promote the existing Draft Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, Transfer and Use of Uranium Weapons and on their Destruction, and to present this convention to the UN member countries to be signed and ratified; calls on all the EU Member States and the UN member countries to impose a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons until such time as a global ban on these weapons has been agreed; 42. Encourages the introduction of measures to combat proliferation financing, following the model of the mechanisms set up to combat terrorism financing; 43. Welcomes the Commission's activities under the IfS to tackle CBRN activities; considers these activities complementary to the Action Plan and calls on the Commission to expand the projects to regions other than just the former Soviet Union (SEDE); building on the experiences under the Instrument for Stability calls on the Commission to launch a call for proposals aimed at strengthening the security and the protection of civilian laboratories in order to avoid future proliferation; 44. Considers that the EU CBRN Action Plan should unambiguously call for the development of EU guidelines on security training and standard requirements to be implemented in all 27 Member States, and should ensure that specific training programmes are provided for those security staff dealing with high-risk CBRN materials, including staff in industries and research centres where high-risk CBRN are present, and that requirements are laid down for CBRN officers (role, competence and training); stresses that safety and awareness training must also be provided to first responders; 45. Stresses that a future short-term revision of the EU CBRN Action Plan should not simply promote self-regulation among the industries concerned, and not merely advise the industries to adopt codes of conduct, but actually call on the Commission to develop pan-European guidelines and regulations applicable to all sectors dealing with high-risk CBRN agents; 46. Considers that it is of the utmost importance to keep a close track of all transactions involving high- risk CBRN materials in the EU, and that instead of merely \u2018urging\u2019 the industry to report on transactions, the Commission and the Member States should work on a proper legal framework to regulate and monitor transactions, thus upgrading the level of security and ensuring proper and rapid reporting of all suspicious transactions as well as the loss or theft of CBRN materials; emphasises that these regulations should establish a proper basis for full transparency in all sectors dealing with CBRN agents, thus holding industries accountable for such transactions; considers that the ability of the private sector to enforce the relevant laws and rules should be taken into account in connection with the monitoring of their reporting obligations so as to ensure proper supervision; EN C 169 E/18 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Stresses that the securitisation of both the transport and storage of CBRN materials is undeniably and inevitably part of the process to make access to these materials as difficult as possible, and so tackling CBRN-related security problems; 48. Stresses that the risks associated with the trading of chemicals over the Internet call for further investigations and specific action; 49. Calls for clarification regarding the strengthening of the import/export regime with regard to the roles of the Member States and the Commission; calls on the Member States to implement and ensure the application of the existing international regulations, and on the Commission to play a monitoring role, assessing and reporting on compliance; notes that it is important, taking into account the evolution of technology, to review and revise relevant legislation and regulations on the acquisition, import, sale, safe storage and transportation of CBRN materials; 50. Stresses the need to strengthen, where they exist, and create, where they do not, inspection and safety mechanisms in all postal services dealing with the distribution of correspondence, in view of the acts of terrorism committed in European countries by placing explosive substances in parcels sent through the post; Detection 51. Calls on the Commission to launch a study, in cooperation with the Member State authorities, to assess the situation on the ground when it comes to the detection of CBRN and on the safety of nuclear power stations in the EU and its neighbourhood in the the event of an accident or intentional terrorist attack; encourages the Commission to build on the results of such an assessment and work on common EU guidelines on how to handle such accidents or intentional attacks, including finding the means to ensure that Member States allocate adequate human and material resources to such an effort; 52. Calls for the strengthening of the role of the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) which has already been established under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism so as to ensure proper exchanges of information and good practices between Member States, leading to pan-European standards in the detection of CBRN activities; 53. Requests the Commission to monitor, assess and report to Parliament on an annual basis on Member States\u2019 compliance, and requests national authorities to ensure that regulations and guidelines are being followed and complied with by the relevant industries and organisations dealing with high-risk CBRN materials; 54. Considers it essential to carry out proper studies with a view to engaging all relevant national and EU bodies and stakeholders on a mandatory basis, including an assessment of ways to make exchanges and cooperation faster and easier, thus making the response to a public safety threat more effective; Preparedness and Response 55. Calls on the Council to entrust the Commission with the role of \u2018coordinator\u2019 with regard to emergency planning, so that it can act as a monitor, thus ensuring that local and national emergency plans do exist; stresses that the Commission should take the role of a depository of such plans, putting it in the best position to identify potential gaps and to act accordingly more promptly than the relevant auth\u00ad orities; 56. Welcomes the intention to strengthen the EU\u2019s civil protection capacity; notes, however, that in many EU Member States military defence departments become proficient through practical experience of tackling CBRN disasters; calls, in that connection, on the Member States and the Commission to share best practices and make a greater investment in thorough coordination between both civilian and military expertise; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/19 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Urges the Commission to continue identifying needs which must be met in order to improve civil protection capacities, with a view to common procurement projects; calls, in that connection, for a particular focus on defining the EU\u2019s needs in terms of CBRN preparedness and response capability, including medical counter-measures, so that the availability of medical counter-measures in the event of a CBRN incident is assessed at both EU and Member State levels; 58. Calls for the organisation of joint exercises between EU Member States, and between Member States and third countries, to prevent dangerous situations arising with regard to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security; 59. Welcomes the planning of EU exercises to simulate CBRN incidents or attacks and stresses that an EU CBRN Action Plan should make provision for the results and assessments of such exercises to feed into what should be an ongoing debate on the development of pan-European standards; 60. Draws attention to the fact that the Commission should be taking the lead in setting standards based on the needs of counter-measure capacities; stresses that this is the only way to achieve the highest possible standard of security throughout the EU, as it would be the only possible way to ensure that all Member States are following the same guidelines and applying the same principles when building up capacities and preparing the appropriate human and material resources to respond to a disaster, whether accidental or intentional; 61. Stresses the need to create regional/EU-wide stockpiles of response resources, the scale of which should, as far as possible, reflect the current level of threat, whether in the form of medical or other types of relevant equipment, under the coordination of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, funded by the EU and in line with commonly agreed EU guidelines; stresses the importance of keeping well-managed stockpiles to ensure that the response resources, medical or other relevant equipment, are fully functional, current and up to date; urges that until such time as this EU/regional pooling of resources comes into effect, the EU CBRN Action Plan should point to a possible way in which Member States would share counter-measures and resources in the event of a CBRN accident or terrorist attack, so as to put the new Solidarity Clause into practice; stresses that any act of assistance to specific EU Member States must be the result of a request from the relevant political authorities in the countries affected and should not collide with a Member State\u2019s ability to protect its own citizens; 62. Calls for a revision of the rules governing the European Solidarity Fund to make it more accessible in the event of natural disasters, and available in the event of industrial and man made disasters, and calls on the Member States to make use of the resources available under the the Structural Funds to enhance prevention and preparedness; 63. In order to prepare for the unfortunate event of an accident, outbreak or deliberate use of CBRN, calls on the Commission to establish reporting mechanisms to provide a link between the work of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and other EU early-warning systems in the relevant areas of health, the environment, food production and animal welfare; calls also on the Commission to establish mechanisms for exchanges of information and analyses with international bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the World Meteorological Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation; 64. Calls for the creation of EU/regional specialised response teams, including medical personnel, law- enforcement staff and military personnel, and notes that, if such teams are created, special training and operational exercises should be scheduled regularly; 65. Calls on the Commission to provide sufficient funding to develop improved equipment for the detection and identification of biological agents in the event of an attack or incident; deplores the fact that existing detection equipment has capacity and speed limitations resulting in the loss of valuable time in EN C 169 E/20 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Calls on the various EU and national bodies involved in information gathering to review their organisational structures and, where they are lacking, appoint appropriate persons with experience and understanding of identifying and assessing CBRN threats and risks; 67. Calls on the Commission to report regularly to Parliament on CBRN threat and risk assessments; 68. Calls for training and public awareness programmes to be launched at European level, considering the opportunities provided by the Internet as a key resource in informing citizens of CBRN issues; stresses the importance of coordinating early warning and information mechanisms for EU citizens in relation to CBRN incidents; notes with interest the feasibility study for a European nuclear security training centre within the JRC; Environmental and health impacts 69. Notes the uncoordinated over-investment in vaccines during the A/H1N1 pandemic; welcomes the Draft Council Conclusions \u2018On lessons learned from the A/H1N1 pandemic - health security in the European Union\u2019 (12665/2010), which envisage the development of a mechanism for the joint procurement of vaccines and antiviral medication to be applied in the Member States on a voluntary basis, and encourages Member States to develop together regional preparedness solutions, including the sharing of existing capacity and the coordination of cost-effective procurement of medical countermeasures, whilst ensuring high levels of CBRN preparedness across the EU; 70. Notes that EU legislation (Council Decision 90/424/EEC, as amended by Council Decision 2006/965/EC) provides for a Community approach to the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses, including the purchase and stockpiling of veterinary medical countermeasures to protect animals from infection; regrets that no such Community approach is in place to coordinate the purchase and stockpiling of medical countermeasures to protect the EU\u2019s human population from infection by dangerous biological pathogens; 71. Points out that an incident or attack involving biological pathogens \u2013 for example, but not restricted to, anthrax \u2013 will contaminate the affected area for decades, seriously harming plant, animal and human life and health, and resulting in long-term economic costs; calls on the Commission to include recovery and decontamination strategies in the CBRN policy; 72. Stresses that an incident involving CBRN materials which affects the condition of the soil and/or the drinking water supply has the potential to produce devastating and far-reaching effects on the health and welfare of all the people in the affected area; calls on the Commission to take this into account when drafting the EU CBRN Action Plan; 73. Stresses the importance of ensuring that there is effective control of water-based contamination incidents, which involve pollution of the environment, soil contamination, disposal of waste and/or release of radioactive substances; 74. Regrets the insufficient attention paid to preparedness and response in the Commission Communi\u00ad cation and the Council Conclusions on the EU CBRN Action Plan, which focus heavily on detection and prevention; calls on the Commission and the Council to give greater importance to developing the preparedness and response mechanisms required to protect public health and the environment should a CBRN incident actually take place on EU territory; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/21 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Is alarmed by cases of individuals and activists being able to acquire nuclear waste material from various reprocessing installations in Europe, and calls for urgent, concerted action to enhance the security of radioactive and nuclear materials and facilities; 77. Regrets the lack of focus in the Commission Communication and Council Conclusions on the CBRN Action Plan on adequately protecting public transport networks and the health of their users, given the many terrorist attacks on transport in recent years and the generally increased risk of CBRN incidents occurring during transport of CBRN materials; calls on the Member States to guarantee pre-exposure protection of first responders to CBRN incidents and post-exposure treatment of victims, in particular against biological pathogens; 78. Points out that a CBRN incident could have long-lasting effects on the growth of food crops and thus has the potential to adversely affect EU food safety and food security; invites to Commission to take this into account when drafting the EU CBRN Action Plan; 79. Encourages cooperation and the sharing of best practices with countries which have developed expertise in the field of CBRN risk assessment, prevention, detection, communication and response, such as the United States, Australia and India; 80.

Welcomes the CoR White Paper on multi-level governance and the recognition of sub-national subsidiarity in the Lisbon Treaty; stresses that the multi-level approach should be applied not only vertically but also horizontally, among actors of the same level, in all shared-competence Union policies including the cohesion policy; 2. Welcomes the conclusions of the M\u00e1laga informal ministerial meeting of March 2010 and considers that multi-level governance is a precondition for achieving territorial cohesion in Europe; calls for this principle to be made compulsory for Member States in policy areas with a strong territorial impact in order to ensure balanced territorial development in line with the subsidiarity principle; points out that such a provision should in no way lead to more burdensome procedures; 3. Considers that satisfactory multi-level governance should be based on a bottom-up approach, taking account of the diversity of administrative arrangements existing in the different Member State; calls on the Member States to identify the most efficient means of implementing governance at the various levels and to improve their cooperation with the regional and local authorities as well as with the Community\u2019s adminis\u00ad tration by, for example, inviting officials from all tiers of government to the periodic meetings organised with the Commission or by establishing European Territorial Pacts that link on a voluntary basis the different tiers of government concerned; 4. Recommends that the territorial impact analysis should become standard practice through the involvement, upstream of the policy decision, of the various parties concerned in order to understand the economic, social and environmental repercussions on the regions of Community legislative and non- legislative proposals; 5. Stresses that multi-level governance allows better exploitation of the potential of territorial cooperation thanks to the relations developed among private and public actors across borders; urges those Member States which have not yet done so to adopt as soon as possible the necessary provisions allowing the setting up of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation; recommends that the Commission promote exchange of information between the EGTCs already created and those in the process of being set up in the framework of existing programmes; congratulates the Committee of the Regions on the quality of its work on EGTCs and calls for its available instruments, in particular its Lisbon Monitoring Platform and its Subsidiarity Monitoring Network, to be used to promote the exchange of best practices between regions and Member States with a view to the joint identification and determination of objectives, subsequent planning actions, and, finally, a comparative evaluation of the outcomes of cohesion policy; 6. Calls on national, regional and local authorities to intensify their use of the integrated approach during the current programming period; proposes that this approach be made compulsory in the context of the future cohesion policy; considers that a flexible and integrated approach should not only take into account the economic, social and environmental aspects of territorial development but also enable coordination of the interests of the various partners, in the light of territorial characteristics, in order to respond to challenges at local and regional level; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/25 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Recommends that the Committee of the Regions use the 2011 Open Days, and as far as still possible at this stage, the 2010 Open Days as an occasion to promote and deepen the debate on identifying the most suitable means of promoting multi-governance; suggests that a European multi-level governance label be launched and put in place in all regions across the EU as from 2011; 9. Notes that decentralised delivery mechanisms are a key factor for multi-level governance; given the necessity for simplification, urges Member States and regions to sub-delegate the implementation of a part of an operational programme, where appropriate and in particular to better exploit the use of global grants; calls on them to take the decentralisation measures required, at both legislative and budgetary levels, so that the system of multi-level governance can work effectively and in keeping with the principles of partnership and subsidiarity; stresses that regional and local authorities, especially those having legislative powers, should be more closely involved, as they are the best informed on their regions\u2019 potentialities and needs and could therefore contribute to an improved implementation of cohesion policy; 10. Urges the Member States to involve relevant regional and local authorities and civil society actors from the very early stages of negotiations on Union legislation and on programmes benefiting from the Structural Funds so as to allow a timely dialogue between the different layers of government; calls for these authorities to participate in the responsible decision-making bodies on an equal footing with the national representatives; 11. Emphasises that for the efficient absorption of funds and maximisation of their impact there must be sufficient administrative capacity both at EU and at regional and local level; calls therefore on the Commission to improve its administrative capacity in order to increase the added value of the cohesion policy and ensure the sustainability of the actions and on the Member States to ensure adequate adminis\u00ad trative structures and human capital in terms of recruitment, remuneration, training, resources, procedures, transparency and accessibility; 12. Calls on the Member States also to strengthen, where appropriate, the role of regional and local authorities in programme preparation, management and implementation as well as boosting the resources at their disposal; recommends the adoption in the cohesion policy of the local development methodology based on local partnerships, in particular for projects related to urban, rural and cross-border issues; calls on the Commission to encourage partnership between regions having a similar specific development potential and to ensure that there is an appropriate framework at EU level put in place for the coordination of macroregional cooperation; 13. Considers that the principles of partnership and co-financing foster the assumption of responsibility by sub-national authorities in the implementation of cohesion policy; reiterates its commitment to these principles of good management and calls for their continued application despite the restrictions on public spending arising from the economic crisis; 14. Recommends enhancing partnership practice and urges the Commission to come up with an agreed definition of the concept of partnership as a condition for building up real partnerships with regional and local authorities and civil society actors; asks the Commission to seriously verify the implementation of this principle by developing specific evaluation tools and to spread best practices in this area through ICT tools; emphasises that partnership can contribute to effectiveness, efficiency, legitimacy and transparency in all the phases of Structural Fund programming and implementation and can increase commitment to and ownership of programme outputs; underlines the important role of the voluntary sector in the partnership process; EN C 169 E/26 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Takes the view that the European networks of regions should broaden their work in the area of good practices in governance and partnership, should put more emphasis on political and strategic lessons learnt from previous programme cycles and should ensure public access to key information on best practices in all European Union languages and thus help to ensure that good practices are in fact implemented; Strengthening the Commission\u2019s role in supporting regional and local authorities 19. Is of the opinion that a stronger role for the regional and local level must correspond to a strengthened supervisory role for the Commission focusing on checking audit systems rather than single projects; calls in this connection for an EU certification system for national audit bodies; urges the Commission to complete the approval of the compliance assessment reports so as to avoid delays in payments and loss of funds due to decommittment, and to come up with a proposal on the tolerable risk of error before 2012; 20. Welcomes the findings of the Commission report on the February 2010 Action Plan and the corrective and preventive actions begun so far; calls on DG REGIO to continue with this exercise during the whole period of implementation to keep up the momentum generated by the Action Plan; 21. Stresses that European initiatives in the field of cohesion and structural policy need to be better coordinated so as not to jeopardise the coherence of regional policy; calls therefore for strengthened coordination in the Commission between DG REGIO, which is responsible for cohesion and structural policy, and the DGs responsible for the relevant sector-specific initiatives; calls, in view of the Lisbon Treaty\u2019s strengthening of the rights of regional and local authorities, for these authorities to be more closely involved in the development of policy at Commission level, in order to enhance project responsi\u00ad bility among project promoters; also calls, however, for more control of results by the Commission on the spot, so as to improve evaluation both of the efficiency of project structures and of the effectiveness of measures in terms of the objective they seek to achieve; 22.

Urges the Commission to quickly launch the new portal in the SFC 2007 database allowing direct access to relevant information for all actors dealing with Structural Funds; recommends that Member States promote and circulate information on this instrument among regional and local authorities as well as final beneficiaries; 24. Invites the Commission to put in place additional technical assistance mechanisms to promote knowledge at regional and local level on implementation-related problems, especially in Member States where, according to the Commission\u2019s ex-post evaluation of Cohesion Policy programmes 2000-2006, there are very persistent problems regarding their administrative capacity when it comes to the implementation of these programmes; 25. Asks for a standardised application of the single information, single audit (SISA)- model at all audit levels to avoid duplication of audits and over-control; urges the Commission to issue a single audit manual including all the guidance notes produced so far; 26. Invites Member States to further exploit the financial engineering instruments as a means to increase the quality of the projects and the participation of private actors, especially SMEs, in European projects; calls on the Commission to simplify the functioning rules of these instruments, whose current complexity limits their use; 27. Is convinced that compliance with the procedures cannot be at the expense of the quality of inter\u00ad ventions; asks the Commission for a more result-oriented policy in the future, focused on quality performance and strategic project development rather than on controls; to this end, urges the Commission to develop objective and measurable indicators which are comparable across the Union for better moni\u00ad toring and evaluating systems and to give further consideration to the need for flexible rules in the event of economic crises; 28. Emphasises that transparent and clear procedures are factors in good governance; therefore welcomes the ongoing simplification of the Financial Regulation and of the Structural Funds rules and calls on the Member States to fully comply with the requirements of the revised Financial Regulation and to disclose information on final beneficiaries of Structural Funds; urges the Commission to propose understandable rules, which will not require frequent modifications; calls for a simpler architecture for the Funds after 2013, not as a consequence of the economic crisis but as a general principle of the future cohesion policy, in order to facilitate absorption of the funds, and recommends greater transparency and flexibility in the use of the EU Funds in order to avoid an additional administrative burden which may discourage potential partners from taking part in projects; 29. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s Strategic Report on the implementation of the Cohesion Policy Programmes 2010 as it can feed important information back to the policy-making process; considers that its findings also have to be seriously taken into account when formulating proposals for improving the effective implementation of Cohesion Policy programmes; 30. Reiterates its commitment to a strong and properly funded cohesion policy that ensures that all European Union regions develop harmoniously; calls for the budget for the policy to be maintained after 2013 and for any attempt to renationalise it to be rejected; 31. Calls on the Commission to take on board the principles of differentiation and proportionality in future regulations and to adapt requirements according to the size of programmes and nature of partners, especially when small public authorities are involved; asks for wider use of lump-sums and flat rates for all Funds, in particular for overheads and technical assistance; proposes that provision be made for more flexible evaluation criteria with a view to encouraging innovative projects and softer control requirements for pilot projects; encourages the Commission to develop the principle of a \u2018bond of trust\u2019 with Member States which undertake to, and succeed in, making good use of the Funds; EN C 169 E/28 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Highlights the achievements of the EU cohesion policy and the fact that its implementation is indispensable for the success of the EU 2020 strategy as an instrument for eliminating the disparities between regions, making them more competitive, facilitating the launch of structural reforms and enhancing the regions\u2019 ability to adapt to the global economic climate; 2. Appreciates that, for the period 2007-2013, all the Member States have devoted a significant amount of their total financial allocations to R&D, innovation and development of a knowledge-based economy, resulting in 246 National or Regional Operational Programmes, with around EUR 86 billion allocated to research and innovation, of which EUR 50 billion has already been allocated for core R&D and innovation activities; stresses that, since research and innovation are essential for the improvement of EU competi\u00ad tiveness in the face of global challenges, investments in these fields must continue and regular results-based assessments of progress must be conducted; recommends, therefore, with a view to the next programming period, that the Member States and the Commission allocate sufficient resources from the structural funds for research and innovation, in particular sustainable innovation, and strengthen research capacities; stresses the need to promote and apply successful models in the knowledge triangle to ensure the sustainable development of regional research and strategic frameworks for innovation, in collaboration with enterprises, research centres, universities and public authorities; highlights the potential of knowledge-intensive regional innovative clusters in mobilising regional competitiveness and calls for better coordination of the structural funds and the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development; 3. Stresses that enhancing the concentration of cohesion-policy resources can ensure that this policy makes a significant contribution to fostering competitiveness, innovation and employment in the EU; 4. Stresses the key role played by both the public sector, at all levels of government, and the private sector in the implementation of cohesion policy, in rebuilding confidence and solidarity in times of recession and thereafter by guaranteeing equal opportunities in terms of access to public investment, especially in infrastructure, new technologies and human capital, and by ensuring sustainable development; 5. Underlines the fact that the economic competitiveness of the EU regions is closely linked to the existence of adequate levels of employment, educated and skilled workforces, social security and access to public services; notes, in this regard, that the support for social cohesion provided by the cohesion policy increases the importance of this policy in terms of overall regional competitiveness on a global scale; EN C 169 E/32 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "6. Takes the view that, in accordance with the spirit of the Treaties, a cohesion policy which aims at reducing disparities in levels of development and prepares the regions to meet long-term and short-term challenges (globalisation, demographic change, the depopulation of rural areas, climate change and biodi\u00ad versity protection), by taking into account their specific strengths and weaknesses, has proved to be essential to the process of European integration; 7. Points out that, by increasing the synergies between research, development and innovation and cohesion policies, the EU 2020 strategy challenges can be better met; stresses that cohesion policy must play a significant role in the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy, since it stimulates structural change across Europe and supports key investment priorities at all levels, local, regional, national and cross-border, ensuring social, economic and territorial cohesion; points out, however, that, while the priorities of the cohesion policy should be aligned with the EU 2020 objectives, it must remain an independent policy capable of accommodating regional specificities and of supporting the weaker and neediest regions so that they overcome their socio-economic difficulties and natural handicaps and reduce disparities; takes the view that ensuring the continuity of cohesion-policy guidelines already in operation will safeguard the regional dimension of RDI and generate jobs in innovative sectors; Territorial cohesion \u2013 a reflection of the local-level impact of EU policies 8. Endorses the views expressed in the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion concerning competitiveness, which \u2018depends on building links with other territories to ensure that common assets are used in a coor\u00ad dinated and sustainable way\u2019 in order to release the potential inherent in the EU\u2019s territorial diversity; stresses, in that connection, that the smooth and coordinated operation of transport services, sufficient access to telecommunications and the pooling, where appropriate, of energy, healthcare, research, education, environmental protection and infrastructure are basic conditions for further boosting competitiveness; calls on the Commission to bring forward concrete proposals for the definition and consistent implementation of the objective of territorial cohesion; 9. Takes the view that the Member States must support a place-based approach to framing and imple\u00ad menting cohesion policy; acknowledges that the role of the regions varies between Member States depending on their political and administrative structure; requests that the principle of subsidiarity, in its strengthened and widened concept as defined in the TFEU, should be duly applied and that improvement should be sought, over the current programming period, by promoting the principle of decentralisation down to local-authority level, with a view to improving the absorption of funds; considers it to be counter\u00ad productive, in this context, that regions administer on average only 30,5 % of the overall budget allocated to cohesion policy, with the remainder being administered by central governments; considers, therefore, that in future the partnership principle must be significantly strengthened; 10. Takes the view that border territories, in particular, highlight the problems that the EU faces in connection with the challenges of opening up borders, completing the internal market and globalisation; emphasises that the competitiveness of such territories may be undermined by the need to cope with competing fiscal and welfare systems, complex administrative arrangements and migratory flows between regions and states; stresses the importance of developing the tools needed for cross-border cooperation and multi-level governance and calls on the Commission to encourage exchanges of information and best practice; 11. Points out that territorial cohesion has a horizontal, multi-sectoral character and that Union policies must therefore contribute to its achievement; reiterates that this concept is not confined to the effects of regional policy but also implies coordination with other Union policies which target sustainable devel\u00ad opment and offer tangible results at regional level, with a view to developing and fully using the specific forms of regional potential and increasing their impact on the ground, boosting regions\u2019 competitiveness and attractiveness and achieving territorial cohesion; is of the opinion that \u2018concentration, cooperation and connection\u2019 are the key coordinates of territorial cohesion with a view to more balanced territorial devel\u00ad opment in the EU; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/33 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "12. Stresses that multi-level governance entails the devolution of responsibility for programmes, allowing for better exploitation of the potential of territorial cooperation, and that, therefore, in order for the Union to be able to pursue common objectives, using coherent and result-oriented measures while establishing specific regional and local priorities, the principles of multi-level governance should be implemented; 13. Welcomes the results of the URBAN and LEADER initiatives and highlights the need to use this past experience and the associated examples of best practice in providing the framework for integrated, balanced rural-urban development, in accordance with the necessities of each region; calls on the Commission to examine and propose working methodologies that promote urban-rural partnerships, combat the depopu\u00ad lation of rural areas and, at the same time, stimulate sustainable urban development, since nearly 80 % of the EU population lives in urban areas; points out that both urban and rural areas play a dynamic role in regional economic development and stresses the need, with a view to the next programming period, for investment in urban as well as sub-urban projects and for better coordination with rural development programmes; Maximizing the impact of cohesion policy to increase economic competitiveness 14. Views partnership as a key principle in the determination of cohesion-policy content, with the \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach enhancing administrative capacities and the quality of the programming process; believes that all levels of government need to play a cohesive, complementary and productive role in boosting the economic competitiveness of the EU; calls on the Commission to give a clearer definition of the partnership principle in order to ensure that real partnerships with regional and local authorities are set up and to facilitate exchanges of best practice between regions; 15. Points out that co-financing is a principle fundamental to the sound management of cohesion policy; calls for its continued application despite the restrictions on public spending which the economic crisis has brought about; 16. Highlights the need to promote entrepreneurship and support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), recognising the key role they have played in fostering economic competitiveness and creating jobs; stresses the need to review and consolidate the role of the EU instruments that support European competi\u00ad tiveness with a view to rationalising administrative procedures, facilitating access to funding, especially for SMEs, introducing innovative incentive mechanisms based on achieving objectives linked to intelligent, sustainable and integrative growth, and promoting closer cooperation with the European Investment Bank and other financial institutions; appreciates, in this context, the added value offered by financial engineering instruments and encourages their use, as well as that of revolving funds and global grants, on the widest possible scale, with a view to achieving positive synergies and maximising results; calls, too, for simplified access to risk capital and micro-finance; 17. Emphasises, moreover, that the efficient implementation of cohesion policy depends strongly on how it is conceived and that it is, therefore, crucial to involve local and regional authorities at an early stage in shaping and implementing future cohesion policy; highlights, likewise, the need to develop horizontal and vertical partnerships between public authorities at all levels with a view to achieving the most efficient governance possible at a number of levels; recalls that multi-level governance is one of the key principles of cohesion policy and that it is fundamental to ensuring the quality of the decision-making process; stresses too, in this context, the importance of the partnership that regional authorities have with the Committee of the Regions; 18. Welcomes the amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 simplifying the procedures for utilisation of the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund and invites the Commission to continue simplifying such procedures to ensure their flexibility and reduce the administrative burden on funding beneficiaries, so that the authorities can address major challenges in a timely manner and with the appro\u00ad priate resources; takes the view that public-private partnerships can provide genuine support by supple\u00ad menting the efforts made at local and regional level, and calls on the Commission to bring forward concrete proposals for the consolidation of public-private partnerships within the framework of cohesion policy; EN C 169 E/34 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "19. Stresses the importance, in the interests of eliminating disparities, of continuing to provide support primarily for projects aimed at regions that are lagging behind, so that the impact expected in this programming period can be maintained and will be in line with initial estimates; notes that improving accessibility and infrastructural facilities will help to make those regions which lag behind in the internal market more competitive, and will thus contribute to the external competitiveness of the EU as a whole; takes the view that withdrawing this support would reduce the impact of the positive initial results; 20. Stresses that, although cohesion policy traditionally focuses on the least prosperous regions, it concerns all European regions, regardless of their level of development; emphasises, therefore, the need to encourage the objective of regional competitiveness and employment; reiterates that a strong and well financed cohesion policy, with a budget at least equivalent to the current one in both absolute and relative terms, is a precondition for delivering the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, in order both to secure an intelligent, sustainable and integrative economy, making the EU globally competitive, and to ensure that all regions develop harmoniously, achieving the objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion; 21. Takes the view that GDP must remain the principal criterion for determining the eligibility of regions for cohesion-policy assistance, while other measurable indicators might be added if proven to be relevant, leaving room for national authorities to apply, at the appropriate level of decision making, other indicators which take into account the specific attributes of regions and cities; 22. Stresses the importance of taking into account, in the allocation of funds, the specific characteristics of, for example, coastal, mountainous outermost regions, regions suffering from depopulation, or remote border regions and towns; encourages the regions to put forward initiatives for exploiting their regional specificity; calls on the Commission to adapt the various financial instruments so as to create added value in the short and medium term, while also taking into consideration the effects of the economic and financial crisis; 23. Invites the Commission to study ways in which new techniques in financial engineering can improve the effectiveness and impact of the cohesion policy, with a view to obtaining the best possible results in the projects chosen; 24. Emphasises the positive effects of gender equality on the EU\u2019s economic growth and social cohesion and, therefore, on its competitiveness; Cohesion policy as a key policy for the post-2013 period 25. Emphasises the decisive role which regional development and territorial cohesion throughout Europe play, by virtue of their European added value, in enhancing the economic competitiveness of the EU and meeting the EU 2020 targets, with the place-based approach being one of the main ways of achieving economic balance; 26. Stresses the need for an integrated approach to the application of the structural funds as an important means of helping regions to achieve sustainable growth, employment and prosperity; 27. Stresses the need to keep transitional arrangements in place to consolidate and improve the current level of development, which could fall if financing is significantly reduced once a given objective is met; points out that this would ensure equal treatment for regions in similar situations, which would in turn lead to the efficient organisation of programmes; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/35 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "28. Reminds the Commission and the Member States that the expectations of the European public are based on people\u2019s needs, and especially on the desire for access to adequate infrastructure and quality public services, which must be provided equitably and at prices affordable by all European citizens regardless of where they live and work; insists that the right to equal opportunities must be respected and stresses the need for disabled access to all infrastructure and projects financed under the structural funds; 29. Stresses that, in order to consolidate knowledge and innovation as motors of future economic growth and European competitiveness, it is necessary to improve the quality of education, build on the results of research, promote innovation and the transfer of knowledge Union-wide, exploit ICTs to the maximum, ensure that innovative ideas are reflected in new products and services which generate growth and quality jobs and contribute to meeting the challenges of social change in Europe and the world, encourage entrepreneurship, prioritise user needs and market opportunities, and guarantee accessible and adequate funding on the basis of a key role for the structural funds; 30. Highlights the fact that economic, social and territorial cohesion provides an opportunity to harness the full potential of research, development and innovation and to ensure that the European public have better living standards and greater confidence in the EU; selective and combined investment in research, development and innovation must take into account regional and urban capacities and potential and help to develop key areas such as e-health, pharmaceuticals, transport and logistics, environment, digital content, energy and security, by means of institutional development and capacity-building programmes; 31. Takes the view that some of the funding allocated to research, development and innovation under the cohesion policy should be used to attain and maintain the role of world leader in sectors where Europe already has a competitive advantage and in those where it has a fresh opportunity to become a world leader; 32. Takes the view that, in order to consolidate the internal market, specific measures are needed to stimulate competition at European level, without however creating an imbalance among Member States; believes that in this way a comfortable level of stability and economic prosperity can be achieved at European level; 33. Recommends that the Member States and the Commission pay greater attention to supporting major projects covering two or more operational programmes with a major impact at European level, which will generate added value, create high-quality jobs and safeguard the sustainable development of the regions; 34. Takes the view that the cohesion policy should continue promoting measures that will generate the greatest possible number of jobs, making it possible to harness local human resources and ensure their ongoing development so as to guarantee high productivity; 35. Maintains that the achievement of economic, social and territorial cohesion is a necessary condition but that it is not sufficient to guarantee economic competitiveness at world level, which requires significant investments in key areas such as energy, the environment, infrastructure, education, research and devel\u00ad opment, creative industries and services, logistics and transport; * * * 36.

Notes that this work programme is the first to be adopted under the new programming cycle, and underlines that the dialogue established with the Commission needs to be deepened in order to improve the obvious link between the political priorities and the budget to finance them at EU level; 2. Urges the Commission to commit itself to performing a realistic and operational programming exercise which must be effective and be translated into reality and better implemented than in the past; asks for a clearer timetable relating to major proposals to be put forward; 3. Urges the Commission to adapt the acquis to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU as soon as possible, according to a clear timetable; Introduction 4.

Draws attention to its resolutions, as well as its oral questions with debates and its findings from missions in 2009 on concrete cases of fundamental rights, such as on privacy, personal dignity and data protection, on the prohibition of torture, on freedom of thought, conscience and religion, on freedom of expression and information, on freedom of the press and media, on non-discrimination, on the use of minority languages, on the situation of the Roma and on free movement, on Roma women, on discrimi\u00ad nation against same sex marriages and civil-partnership couples, on minors, on retention centres for immigrants, and on the alleged illegal detention of prisoners under the CIA rendition programme; stresses that all these resolutions reflect the values enshrined in the Charter, show its clear commitment to the everyday protection of fundamental rights, and send political messages to all individuals in the EU, the Member States and the EU institutions as well as international partners; 3. Regrets that the Council and Commission have not followed up any of the recommendations contained in the European Parliament\u2019s 2007 report on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners ( 1 ) nor shared with the European Parliament information on EU-US discussions on this topic; 4. Considers it necessary to reflect on developments in relation to the protection of fundamental rights in the post-Lisbon period and, in that context, intends this resolution to clarify the role that each institution and mechanism should play in the new European architecture of fundamental rights; 5. Reiterates that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009 has fundamentally changed the legal face of the EU, which should establish itself increasingly as a community of shared values and principles; thus welcomes the new, multi-level EU system of fundamental rights protection that emanates from multiple sources and is enforced through a variety of mechanisms, including the legally binding Charter; the rights guaranteed by the ECHR, recognition of which flows from the Union\u2019s obligation to accede; and the rights based on the Member States\u2019 constitutional traditions and their interpretation according to the jurisprudence of the ECtHR and the CJ; 6. Reaffirms that the Charter has the same legal value as the Treaties and represents the most modern codification of fundamental rights, offering a good balance between rights and solidarity and encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as well as \u2018third generation\u2019 rights (i.e. the rights to good administration, freedom of information, a healthy environment and consumer protection); considers that the EU should develop a regulatory framework to protect against fundamental rights abuses by businesses; 7. Stresses that the incorporation of the Charter into primary EU law, while not extending the Union\u2019s competences and respecting the principle of subsidiarity as defined in its Article 51, creates new respon\u00ad sibilities for the decision-making and implementing institutions, as well as for Member States when imple\u00ad menting EU legislation at national level, and that the Charter\u2019s provisions have thus become directly enforceable by European and national courts; calls on the EU institutions and Member States to increase coherence among their various bodies responsible for monitoring and implementation, with a view to effective application of the established comprehensive framework, and to reinforce a cross-EU monitoring mechanism, as well as an early warning system, such as the Universal Periodic Review; 8. Recalls that respect for the core values of the EU and protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute common ground in the Union\u2019s relations with third countries, and stresses that the EU is bound by the Charter also in this respect; in this regard, recalls that the promotion of democracy and of the rule of law goes hand in hand with the respect, protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms; underlines the fact that, within the new institutional structure of the EU, the European External Action Service (EEAS) can only offer an opportunity to enhance coherence and effectiveness in the sphere of external policy efforts to promote human rights and democracy if a human- rights-based approach to the service\u2019s structure, resources and activities is endorsed; emphasises that the Union plays a leading role in the promotion of human rights in the world; in this regard, calls on the EU to ensure the effectiveness of the human rights clauses in the international agreements and to take into account the principles of the Charter when entering into agreements with third countries, as well as to maintain coherence between its internal and external human rights policy; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/51 ( 1 ) OJ C 287 E, 29.11.2007, p. 309.

        "9. Reaffirms that EU accession to the ECHR will constitute the minimum level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe and provide an additional mechanism for enforcing human rights, namely the possibility of lodging a complaint with the ECtHR in relation to a violation of human rights derived from an act by an EU institution or a Member State implementing EU law, falling within the remit of the ECHR; and that ECtHR case law will thus provide extra input for current and future EU action on the respect for, and promotion of, fundamental freedoms in the areas of civil liberties, justice and home affairs, in addition to the case law of the Court of Justice in this field; 10. Calls on all the Member States of the EU and of the Council of Europe to express their clear political commitment to and their will to support the accession process and agreement as well as to ensure the transparency of the accession process while stressing the need for proper consultation with relevant stakeholders; calls on the Commission to finalise its internal consultations, as well as the negotiations with the Council of Europe, by finding adequate solutions to the main technical questions in order to complete the accession process within a reasonable time limit and in order to ensure the highest possible level of protection of human rights in Europe; 11. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to raise awareness of the benefits of accession to the ECHR and of all the requirements to be fulfilled by the applicants, by developing guidelines on the adequate application and the effects of this additional mechanism in order to ensure that it can be used efficiently and effectively, as well as by including it in the training of all relevant professionals; 12. Welcomes, furthermore, the new horizontal obligations created by the Treaty of Lisbon to combat social exclusion and discrimination and to promote social justice and protection, equality between men and women, respect for private and family life, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child, and to develop a common policy on asylum and immigration and combat trafficking in human beings, as well as its explicit reference to persons belonging to minorities, which reflects another founding value of the Union; welcomes the fact that the Union has acquired legal personality allowing it to accede to international treaties, the improvement in judicial protection with the extension of the jurisdiction of the CJ to areas of obvious relevance to the protection of fundamental rights, such as police and judicial cooperation in the field of criminal law, the strengthened role of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the European decision-making process, especially in evaluating the implementation of EU policy in the AFSJ, the increased role of European citizens, now invested with the power to initiate EU legislation through the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative, and the obligation to maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society (Article 11(2) TEU); 13. Calls for full and consistent implementation, in compliance with international and European human rights law, of the Stockholm Programme, which converts the obligations and principles deriving from the Treaty into practice by setting the strategic guidelines for the AFSJ; Institutions implementing the new fundamental-rights architecture 14. Considers that the European institutions have often acted in parallel in the field of protection of fundamental rights and therefore calls for reflection on actions taken and for improved cooperation among these institutions, such as established inter-institutional cooperation for the annual monitoring of the situation of human rights in the EU, so that each institution can build upon other institutions\u2019 reports; 15. Notes the creation of a new \u2018Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship\u2019 portfolio within the Commission as an indication of its commitment to step up its efforts in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms and as a positive response to Parliament\u2019s repeated requests in this regard; such a division between justice and security should not reinforce the misconceived dichotomy between the need to protect the human rights of all people and the need to guarantee their security; the new Commissioner should pay particular attention to EU policies on fighting irregular migration and terrorism, and the full support of the College of Commissioners is crucial to enable the new Commissioner to maintain a high profile; 16. Calls on the Commission to make 2013 the European Year of Citizenship in order to give momentum to the debate on European citizenship and inform EU citizens of their rights, in particular the new rights resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon; EN C 169 E/52 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Reminds the Commission to monitor all new legislative proposals for compliance with the Charter, and to check existing instruments in this respect; suggests that the impact assessments accompanying Commission proposals should clearly indicate whether such proposals comply with the Charter, so that this consideration becomes an integral part of the bringing forward of legislative proposals; recalls the Commission of its explicit task to involve parties concerned by broad consultations in order to ensure coherence and transparency in the Union's actions (Article 11(3) TEU); underlines in this regard the importance of the FRA Platform as a significant resource for fulfilling this task; 19. Reminds the Commission to undertake objective investigations and start infringement proceeding whenever a Member State, in implementing EU legislation, violates the rights enshrined in the Charter; further reminds the Commission to request that Member States provide reliable data and facts and to collect information also from non-governmental sources, as well as to request the FRA and other human rights bodies for input; 20. Draws attention to the recent revival of nationalism, xenophobia and discrimination in some Member States and stresses the central role that the Commission should take in order to prevent and combat these possible violations of fundamental rights; 21. Emphasises the importance of the Commission\u2019s annual monitoring of compliance with the Charter, and notes that its monitoring reports should contain an assessment of the implementation of the guaranteed rights, an evaluation of the most contentious issues and of the situation of the most vulnerable groups in the Union, existing protection gaps, key trends and structural problems at national and EU level, with a view to proposing concrete initiatives and measures, recommends the dissemination of best practices to the Member States; 22. Welcomes the Commission Communication on the Strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European Union referring among others to its preventing approach in the effective implementation, the importance of internal training on fundamental rights, the systematic check of the fundamental rights aspect of the Commission's impact assessments by the Impact Assessment Board, as well as the targeted communication measures tailored to various situations needed in this respect; furthermore welcomes the emphasis of the above-mentioned Commission Communication regarding the importance of the political criteria for accession laid down by the 1993 Copenhagen European Council requiring candidate countries to have stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; the preservation of this criterion is supporting the protection of fundamental rights in the future Member States; 23. Calls on the Commission to enforce the values and principles enshrined in the Treaty and Charter and the strategy set out in the Stockholm Programme through concrete legislative proposals while having regard to the jurisprudence of the ECtHR when carrying out these activities; furthermore, calls for the \u2018Lisbonisation\u2019 of the current acquis in the field of police and judicial cooperation and for a strengthening of democratic accountability in the AFSJ; 24.

Calls on the Council to adapt to the changes required by the Treaty and to comply with the Charter when legislating; therefore welcomes the establishment of the Council\u2019s standing Working Party on Funda\u00ad mental Rights, Citizens Rights and Free Movement of Persons and underlines the importance for this new body to have a broad mandate to include issues in relation to fundamental rights with EU and Member States relevance and provide a forum for a Council exchange of views on internal human rights matters, and for the work of this new body to be transparent and efficient, also in relation to the European Parliament; 27. Reaffirms the inter-institutional agreement Common Approach to Impact Assessment ( 1 ) referred to in the Commission Communication on the Strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European Union, which states that the Parliament and the Council are responsible for assessing the impact of their own amendments; 28. Calls on the Council to ensure that the Council Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens Rights and Free Movement of Persons (FREMP) has a broad mandate that could include, for example, discussing and responding officially to reports of the FRA (in addition to recommendations of UN treaty bodies, special procedures and mechanisms), assessing the external human rights impact of EU instruments and policies, in coordination with the Council Human Rights Working Group (COHOM), ensuring coor\u00ad dination with agencies without a human rights mandate but human rights impacts (e.g. EIB or FRONTEX), examining EU and Member States signature, ratification and compliance with international human rights instruments and providing a forum for Council exchanges on internal human rights matters; 29. Calls for respect of its right to democratic scrutiny based on the treaties; insists on the necessity of enhancing transparency and access to documents between EU institutions, in order to develop more effective interinstitutional cooperation, including accountability on matters related to fundamental rights; underlines its role in following up its resolutions related to fundamental rights in the EU and its role in evaluating the work of other EU institutions in terms of their action or inaction when assessing devel\u00ad opments in the field (e.g. through annual reports), combining as it does political messages with a facts-based approach; underlines its right, enshrined in Article 218(10) TFEU, to be immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure for concluding international agreements between the Union and third countries or international organisations; 30. Reaffirms the fact of the CJ\u2019s enhanced role in ensuring that all EU institutions, agencies and Member States implementing EU law respect the Charter accordingly, and notes that this will enable the CJ to strengthen and further develop its case law on fundamental rights; stresses the need for established cooperation between national courts, the CJ and the ECtHR in furthering the development of a coherent system of case law in the field; 31. Emphasises the role of the FRA in the continued observance of the fundamental rights situation within the Union and the implications of the Treaty of Lisbon in this field, by providing analysis, assistance and expertise, a task which requires quality, objectivity, effective impartiality and transparency; calls on the Commission to review and strengthen the mandate of the FRA in order to align its work with the new requirements based on the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter; points out that, within the reviewed mandate, the monitoring role of the FRA should extend to the acceding countries; therefore adequate resources are needed for the increased tasks following the implementation of the Charter; reiterates its request to be fully associated in revising the multi-annual programme of the FRA; welcomes the inclusion of an Annex in the FRA\u2019s Annual report, indicating the ratification by Member States of international human rights instruments; 32. Stresses that the main task of the FRA is to provide the decision-making institutions with facts and data on matters related to fundamental rights and that, to this end, it collects and analyses information and data, as well as raising awareness by carrying out scientific research and surveys based on thorough methodologies, publishing thematic and annual reports and networking and promoting dialogue with civil society; welcomes its 2009 annual report and its approach of providing a comparative overview and highlighting good practice in the 27 Member States; EN C 169 E/54 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 ( 1 ) Council document 14901/05 of 24.11.2005.

Underlines the fact that the EU and the Member States share obligations in the field of the imple\u00ad mentation and/or enforcement of human and fundamental rights, in their respective spheres of responsi\u00ad bility, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, and that this shared responsibility and competence represents both an opportunity and an obligation on the part of the Member States and of EU institutions; highlights the enhanced role of the national parliaments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon and supports the establishment of a formal ongoing dialogue between the European Parliament and national parliaments; 37.

Maintains that the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive provides an essential legal framework for combating misleading and aggressive advertising, in relations between companies and consumers; recognises that although it is not yet possible to undertake a comprehensive evaluation, several difficulties with implementation and interpretation are already apparent (especially regarding the new, more pervasive forms of advertising), as demonstrated by European Court of Justice judgements ruling against existing national measures for going beyond the provisions of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which may call into question the efficacy of the Directive; 2. Emphasises that differences in its interpretation and implementation at national level have precluded the desired level of harmonisation, creating legal uncertainty and undermining cross-border trade in the single market; 3. Calls on the Commission to update, clarify and strengthen its guidelines on the implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive on a very regular basis and ensure that they are translated into the EU\u2019s official languages, and calls on the Member States to take those guidelines into account as far as possible; 4. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention of finalising and publishing in November 2010 a database of national measures adopted to transpose the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the applicable case law and other relevant documents; 5. Recalls that the scope of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is limited to business-to-consumer relations while the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive deals with business-to-business relations; underlines that certain entities do not fall within the scope either of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive or of the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive, such as NGOs or interest groups; therefore calls on the Commission to conduct a separate analysis of the impact of misleading advertising practices targeting those categories apparently not covered by either Directive; calls on the Member States to improve coordination between themselves and to provide adequate solutions for those categories that have been subjected to intra-EU cross-border misleading advertising practices; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/61 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Calls on the Member States to provide the competent national authorities with the necessary financial, human and technological means and resources for their effective action; urges the Commission, on the basis of the Consumer Protection Cooperation network experience, to further facilitate the cooperation between national authorities and improve the effectiveness of their control; 8. Asks the Commission to prepare an analysis of the obligations and control functions of the national consumer authorities and to share best practices so as to improve the effectiveness of their work; 9. Calls on the Commission to extend the scope of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 to include counter\u00ad feiting and illegal products, and to boost the exchange of information between Member States under that Regulation, so as to improve the fight against fraud connected with illegal advertising; 10. Considers the practice of self-regulation as a dynamic, flexible and responsible adjunct to the existing legislative framework; suggests that those Member States that do not yet have self-regulatory bodies should facilitate the establishment of such bodies, on the basis of best practices from other Member States, and/or grant them formal recognition; 11. Emphasises nevertheless the limits of self-regulation, which cannot in any case take the place of legislation, particularly as regards the establishment of rules to protect the personal data of consumers and the penalties applicable if such rules are not respected; 12. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to evaluate the implementation of national codes of conduct relating to the media and new information and communication technologies; calls on the Member States to assess the effectiveness of national self-regulatory bodies; 13. Underlines the societal responsibility that comes with the impact and reach of widespread and pervasive advertising, and emphasises the role of advertising companies in cultivating a culture of corporate awareness and responsibility; 14. Encourages consultation of the various stakeholders involved in legislative developments; 15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure by appropriate means that the media and advertising professionals guarantee respect for human dignity and that they oppose direct or indirect discriminatory or stereotyping images or any incitement to hatred based on sex, race, ethnic origin, age, religious or other beliefs, sexual orientation, disability and social status; 16. Calls on those Member States that have not yet implemented the Audiovisual Media Services Directive to do so immediately; awaits with interest the publication by the Commission of the report on the application of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and stresses the need to address the use of new technologies (such as IPTV); Issues arising from the development of the internet and new technologies 17. Denounces the development of \u2018hidden\u2019 internet advertising that is not covered by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (consumer-to-consumer relationships), in the form of comments posted on social networks, forums and blogs, the content of which is difficult to distinguish from mere opinion; considers indeed that there is a risk that consumers will make wrong decisions in the belief that the information on which they are based stems from an objective source; denounces cases in which certain business operators finance directly or indirectly any action to encourage the dissemination of messages or comments appearing to emanate from consumers themselves when in reality these are messages of an advertising or commercial nature, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure proper application of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in this regard; EN C 169 E/62 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Suggests that the Member States encourage the emergence of forum observers/moderators who are alert to the dangers of hidden advertising, as well as the development of information campaigns aimed at warning consumers of these \u2018hidden\u2019 forms of advertising; 19. Points out that the campaign at European level against this hidden advertising is of great importance for cleaning up the market and boosting consumer confidence, as to some professionals it may be a means of bending the competition rules and artificially over-valuing, without cost, their own company or even unfairly maligning a competitor; 20. Voices its concern about the routine use of behavioural advertising and the development of intrusive advertising practices (such as reading the content of e-mails, using social networks and geolocation, and retargeted advertising) which constitute attacks on consumers' privacy; 21. Emphasises the risk presented by companies that are both content providers and advertising sales houses (owing to the potential for cross-referencing data collected in the course of each of these activities); calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure that different levels of data collection are kept wholly separate; 22. Stresses that consumers must receive clear, accessible and comprehensive information about how their data are collected, processed and used and urges advertisers to work towards a standard use of the consumer-friendly opt-in format; notes that this personal data should be kept and used only with the explicit agreement of the consumer; 23. Stresses the need for consumers to be informed fully when they accept advertising in exchange for discounts based on behavioural marketing techniques; 24. Underlines the need to incorporate privacy issues as standard in future technological solutions which involve personal data; considers that developers of new technology must, from the very beginning of the development process, incorporate data security and protection in line with the highest standards and with reference to \u2018Privacy by Design\u2019; 25. Calls on the Commission to explore the various means (whether legislative or not) and ascertain the technical options at European Union level to effectively implement the following measures: \u2014 carry out an in-depth study of new advertising practices involving online communication or portable devices; report the results of the study to Parliament; \u2014 prohibit as soon as possible the systematic, indiscriminate sending of text message advertisements to all mobile phone users within the coverage area of an advertising poster equipped with Bluetooth tech\u00ad nology without their prior consent; \u2014 ensure that advertising practices respect the confidentiality of private correspondence and legislation applicable in this area; prohibit as soon as possible the reading by a third party, particularly for advertising or commercial purposes, of the content of private e-mails; \u2014 require as soon as possible advertisements sent by e-mail to contain an automatic link enabling the recipient to refuse all further advertising; \u2014 ensure as soon as possible the application of techniques making it possible to distinguish advertising tracking cookies, for which free and explicit prior consent is required, from other cookies; \u2014 ensure that the use of default settings for computer systems sold to the public and for social networking services is systematically established in accordance with the strictest data protection standards (\u2018privacy by design\u2019); EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/63 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "\u2014 develop an EU website labelling system, modelled on the European Privacy Seal, certifying a site\u2019s compliance with data protection laws; considers that this should include a thorough impact assessment and must avoid duplication of existing labelling systems; \u2014 pay particular attention, in cooperation with national advertising authorities and/or self-regulatory bodies, to misleading advertising, including online, in specific sectors such as the selling of food products, pharmaceuticals and medical care, where the health of consumers, on top of their economic interests, is likely to be affected, with potential serious consequences; \u2014 modify the limited liability regime for information society services in order to make the sale by search engines of registered brand names as advertising keywords subject to prior authorisation from the owner of the brand name in question; Protecting vulnerable groups 26. Calls on the Commission to conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of misleading and aggressive advertising on vulnerable consumers, in particular children and adolescents, by 2012, and to guarantee the proper application of the relevant laws on the protection of children and adolescents; 27. Calls on the Commission to carry out as a matter of priority an in-depth study on the precise socio- psychological effects of advertising, in view of the new refined techniques being deployed; 28. Stresses that children and adolescents are especially vulnerable categories of people in view of their great receptiveness and curiosity, lack of maturity, limited free will and high potential to be influenced, especially through the use of new means of communication and technologies; 29. Urges Member States to promote greater protection of vulnerable consumers, such as children, to encourage the media to restrict TV advertising addressed at children during TV programmes watched mainly by the young (such as children\u2019s educational programmes, cartoons, etc.), given that similar measures are already being implemented in some Member States; 30. Calls for all children's specific interests to be free from targeted advertising; 31. Draws attention to the vulnerability of consumers to mimetism, which can lead to inappropriate behavioural attitudes, violence, tensions, disappointment, anxiety, harmful addictions (smoking, drugs), eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, and disturbance of mental equilibrium; calls on all advertising agencies and media professionals to reconsider the promotion of extremely skinny models (men or women) in order to avoid harmful messages about appearance, body imperfections, age and weight, taking into account the influence and impact of advertising on children and young people; Guaranteeing gender equality and human dignity in advertising 32. Calls on the Commission and Member States to take appropriate means to ensure that marketing and advertising guarantee respect for human dignity, without any discrimination based on gender, religion, convictions, disability, age or sexual orientation; 33. Takes the view that advertising can be an efficient tool in challenging and confronting stereotypes and a lever against racism, sexism and discrimination, essential in today\u2019s multicultural societies; calls on the Commission, Member States and advertising professionals to strengthen training and education activities as a way to overcome stereotypes, combat discrimination and promote gender equality, especially from a young age; urges the Member States in particular to introduce and develop close cooperation with existing schools of marketing, communication and advertising, so as to help provide sound training for the sector\u2019s future workforce; 34. Urges the Commission to promote comparative research and documentation among the Member States concerning the image of women being projected by advertising and marketing content and to identify good practices for effective and gender-friendly advertising; EN C 169 E/64 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "35. Urges the Commission and Member States to consolidate the role and encourage the consultation of user and/or consumer organisations responsible for evaluating the impact of advertising on gender outlook and elsewhere; 36. Stresses that advertising often communicates discriminatory and/or undignified messages based on all forms of gender stereotyping, which hinder gender equality strategies; calls on the Commission, Member States, civil society and advertising self-regulatory bodies to cooperate closely to combat such practices, notably by using effective tools which guarantee respect for human dignity and probity by marketing and advertising; 37. Stresses that, since the advertising of consumer goods is associated directly with the press, radio and television media, of which it is an inseparable component, and indirectly with the film industry and television series in the form of product placement, it follows that reliable advertising and the promotion of healthy role models may have a positive influence on society\u2019s perceptions of issues such as gender roles and the human body image and normality; encourages advertisers to be more constructive in their adver\u00ad tisements, in order to promote the positive role of women and men in society, at work, in the family and in public life; Educating and informing the various stakeholders 38. Stresses the crucial importance of transparency and consumer information in the advertising field, and the need for consumers to develop a critical attitude to the quality of media content; 39. Calls on the Commission to: \u2014 include some additional advertising-related indicators in the Consumer Markets Scoreboard (as well as the data already included on fraudulent or mendacious advertising); draws attention, however, in this connection to the terms of its resolution of 9 March 2010 ( 1 ) stipulating that adding further indicators may be useful when the five basic indicators and the associated methodology have been developed to a sufficiently high level; \u2014 devise information campaigns on consumers\u2019 rights in respect of advertising, including the use of their personal data, and to develop educational material explaining how they can protect their privacy on the internet and what they can do to put a stop to any situation that undermines their privacy or dignity; \u2014 develop an EU programme designed to teach children to be wary of advertising, modelled on the United Kingdom\u2019s Media Smart initiative; \u2014 require, as soon as possible, the insertion of the clearly readable words \u2018behavioural advertisement\u2019 into the relevant online advertisements, as well as a window containing a basic explanation of this practice; 40.

        "D. whereas future energy price developments will encourage individuals to reduce their energy consumption; therefore significant energy efficiency gains can be reached by incentivising more efficient common infrastructures in buildings, heating systems and transport sector where otherwise decisions improving the use of energy are beyond the control and influence of individuals or companies, E. whereas academic evidence clearly supports that efforts need to be stepped up, including at the regional and the local level to reach the 20 % energy efficiency target by 2020, as at current rates of progress only around half of this target would be met by 2020, even though practices and tech\u00ad nologies to achieve this target already exist, F. whereas although many legislative measures designed to achieve energy savings have been introduced at EU and national level, not all of them are producing the desired results, G. whereas the payback period for investments in energy efficiency is relatively short compared to other investments and investments have the potential to create a significant number of new local jobs in rural as well as in urban areas which can to a large extent not be outsourced, in particular in the construction sector and within SMEs, while public awareness and skilled workers are needed to make it happen, H. whereas using public funds in revolving financial instruments for giving financial incentives to energy efficiency measures has the advantage, at times of budgetary constraints, that it makes it possible to sustain most of these funds over time, I. whereas the demand side has been an important driver for increased energy consumption and there is a real need to address market and regulatory barriers to more energy-efficient products and to promote their use, in order to decouple energy consumption from economic growth, J. whereas a range of barriers stand in the way of full exploitation of energy saving opportunities, including upfront investment costs and non-availability of suitable finance, lack of awareness, split incentives such as between landlords and tenants, and lack of clarity over who is responsible for delivering energy savings, K. whereas mandatory targets have been shown in the case of other priority areas such as renewable energy and air quality to provide the drive, ownership and focus at EU and national level that are needed to ensure sufficient ambition in specific policies and dedication to their implementation, L. whereas progress on energy saving is hampered by a lack of accountability for and commitment to delivering the 20 % target, M. whereas buildings are responsible for about 40 % of energy consumption and about 36 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU and whereas construction represents a large part of the EU economy with about 12 % of the EU GDP; whereas the refurbishment rate of existing buildings is too low and whereas adequate measures to reduce the energy consumption of existing buildings are still missing; whereas increasing the number and level of deep renovations in the existing building stock is essential in order to reach the 2020 and 2050 EU policy goals on climate and energy and could create a substantial number of jobs thus contributing significantly to EU economic recovery, and whereas energy efficiency solutions on building envelope and with technical systems and installations already exist and can be implemented on both existing and new buildings leading to significant energy savings, N. whereas homes are not prepared for climate change: there are homes not being comfortably cool in the summer in all countries and there are homes not being comfortable warm in the winter (above 15 % in Italy, Latvia, Poland, Cyprus and 50 % in Portugal) and in country like Cyprus and Italy houses are not prepared for having cold winter, O. whereas industrial electrical motors consume 30 %-40 % of the electrical energy generated worldwide and whereas proper optimisation of relevant motor systems by using speed regulation and other techniques can save between 30 % and 60 % of energy consumed, EN C 169 E/68 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "P. whereas between 50 and 125 millions of Europeans are suffering from energy poverty and these figures may rise with the economic crisis and the increase in energy prices; whereas causes for energy poverty are universal across the EU and involve a combination of low household income, poor heating and insulation standards and unaffordable energy prices; underlines that energy savings and energy efficiency policies are strategic remedies to energy poverty, Q. whereas transport is responsible for almost 30 percent of the total European greenhouse gas emissions, a move from conventional fossil fuels cars to green technology vehicles powered by renewable energy, would contribute to substantial CO 2 reduction, and create an optional energy storage, enabling the power grids to cope with the fluctuating production of renewable energy sources, R. whereas an estimated 69 % of the housing stock in Europe is owner-occupied and 17 % is private rented predominantly by individual landlords and whereas the private housing sector face financial constraints to carry out energy refurbishments, S. whereas the current economic crisis could lead to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon and energy efficient economy and to fostering a change of citizens' behaviour regarding energy consumption, T. whereas it is essential that new, cutting-edge energy technologies which make for sustainable energy production and more efficient energy use should be developed and marketed, U. whereas reaching the binding renewable energy target of 20 % of final energy consumption by 2020 will only be achieved if the existing buildings stock is addressed, V. whereas European companies have impressive track records for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and, more importantly, for enabling emission reductions across European society and across the world through innovative products and solutions, W. whereas the aim must be to maintain the competitiveness of energy-intensive European undertakings facing global competition, Compliance with and implementation of existing legislation 1. Calls on Member States, local authorities, and especially on the Commission, to give energy efficiency the attention it deserves, and put in place resources (staffing and finance) which match their ambitions; 2. Points out that energy efficiency should be integrated into all relevant policy areas, including finance, regional and urban development, transport, agriculture, industrial policy and education; 3. Calls on the Commission to present in sufficient time before the 4th February 2011 Energy Summit within its revised EEAP an evaluation of the implementation of the existing legislation; considers that based on the result of the evaluation the EEAP should include measures to be put forward by the Commission to close this gap to reach the overall energy efficiency target in 2020, such as individual energy efficiency targets that correspond to at least 20 % improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 at EU level and which take into account relative starting positions and national circumstances as well as an approval in advance of each Member States' national energy efficiency action plan; considers that such additional measures should be fair, measurable, have an effective and direct impact on the implementation of national energy efficiency plans target; calls on the Commission and Member States to agree on a common methodology for measuring national energy efficiency targets and monitoring progress on achieving these targets; 4. Attaches great importance to planning processes at European level. Energy efficiency should be given due attention in the Energy Action Plan 2011-2020. The new European Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be presented as soon as possible, and energy efficiency should have an important role in the future Roadmap towards a low carbon energy system and economy by 2050; 5. Calls for the EU to adopt a binding target on energy efficiency by at least 20 % by 2020, and thereby advance the transition into a sustainable and green economy; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/69 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "6. Considers that the Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be ambitious and focus on the full energy supply chain, which takes stock of the progress achieved with all measures contained in the 2006 Action Plan, reinforces implementation of energy efficiency measures adopted as outlined in the 2006 Action Plan, which are still under way, and includes additional measures which are cost-efficient and adequate principles in line with the criteria of subsidiarity and proportionality, that are required to achieve the 2020 target; 7. Calls on the Commission to design the new EEAP taking into account the needs of vulnerable energy consumers; notes that energy consumers would benefit the most from energy efficiency improvements but lack resources to undertake the necessary investments; calls on Members States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty and to report regularly on their actions to address this concern; welcomes the fact that the Energy Council addresses the problem of energy poverty and supports the efforts of the Belgian presidency in this regard; asks the Commission to tackle energy poverty in all energy policies; 8. Calls for a revision of the Energy Services Directive (ESD) in 2011 that includes an expanded time framework until 2020, a critical assessment of National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and their imple\u00ad mentation, including common standards for reporting containing binding minimum elements on e.g. all relevant energy efficiency policies including soft and supporting tools like financing; evaluation and ranking Member State\u2019s actions as well as merging reporting requirements from the ESD, energy labelling and eco- design where appropriate and where it is shown to remove burdens from Member States; 9. Urges Member States to implement quickly and efficiently market surveillance and compliance-moni\u00ad toring programmes for Directive 2009/125/EC establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products, Directive 2010/30/EU on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products, and Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters, and calls on the Commission to facilitate and monitor the implementation of these programmes and start infringement procedures if necessary; 10. Suggests that, understanding the challenge and importance of market surveillance, which is a national competence, the Commission should facilitate cooperation and sharing of information among Member States, in particular by creating an open EU database of test results and of non-compliant products identified in Member State and by taking steps to ensure that a non-compliant product identified in one Member State is quickly removed from all 27 Markets; 11. Following the entry into force of the revised Energy Labelling Directive, encourages the Commission to assess, before the 2014 date mentioned in the Directive, the impact of the new energy labelling layout, and the mandatory reference to the energy-label scheme in advertisements on consumers' behaviour and to take further measures if necessary to increase their effectiveness; 12. Calls upon the Commission and the Member States to promote measures to raise the level of awareness for and the know-how of energy efficiency issues among all relevant stakeholders and all professional actors involved at all stages (assessment of existing energy performance, design and implemen\u00ad tation of energy efficiency solutions, energy efficient operation and maintenance); 13. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to review the effectiveness of legislative measures to save energy and increase energy efficiency; 14. Considers that long-term agreements with the industry sector ensure a high compliance rate with energy efficiency requirements and thereby are able to result in an annual 2 % energy efficiency improvement; EN C 169 E/70 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "Energy infrastructure (production and transmission) 15. Considers that a stronger focus is needed on system innovations such as smart grids (for electricity but also for heating and cooling), smart metering, gas networks integrating biogas and energy storage which can facilitate energy efficiency by means of reduced congestion, fewer grid disconnections, easier integration of renewable technologies including the decentralised production, reduced reserve generation requirements and greater and more flexible storage capacities; asks to ensure that a fair share of these gains accrue to the end-use customers; 16. Underlines that district heating and cooling networks contribute to achieve a energy-efficient economy by 2050 and stresses that an explicit and comprehensive strategy for heat generation and use (industrial heat, domestic heating, cooling) is needed (including a method of multi-fuel benchmarks for district heating and cooling networks) that builds on synergies between sectors; calls on the Commission to undertake an inquiry on increasing their efficiency; stresses that these networks must be open to competition; notes that improvements to the energy efficiency of the housing stock will lead to a reduction in heat demand which should be factored in when assessing district heating capacity; 17. Emphasises the important role of supply side energy efficiency; points out that transmission and distribution, contribute considerably to energy loss (notably in generators and transformers, as well as those resulting from excessively high resistances during transmission) and that shortening excessively long conversion chains for converting one type of energy into another electricity represents a major source of savings; stresses the role that microgeneration and decentralised and diversified generation might play in guaranteeing supply security and reducing losses; considers that incentives should be created aimed at improving infrastructure and asks the Commission to make proposals to unlock the untapped savings potential, including by introducing sustainability reports for power stations and taking measures to facilitate the retrofitting and modernisation of power stations; 18. Stresses the fact that second to energy efficiency at the source (i.e. in primary energy production), tackling losses of (electrical) energy during transport through the grids should be considered a priority. Moving towards a more decentralised production system would reduce transport distances and thus energy losses during transport; 19. Urges the (petro) chemical industries throughout the EU to enhance energy recovery during flaring; 20. Considers that a stronger focus is needed to increase the overall energy system efficiency, in particular to reduce heat losses; therefore calls for a revision of the CHP Directive within the 2011 working programme to promote highly efficient CHP, Micro-CHP, use of waste heat from industry, and district heating/cooling, by encouraging Member States to set up a stable and favourable regulatory framework by introducing integrated energy demand planning for heat/cooling electricity, by considering priority access to the electricity grid for CHP, the use of industrial heat, and by promoting use of highly efficient CHP, Micro-CHP and district heating in buildings and sustainable funding for CHP, e.g. by encouraging Member States to introduce financial incentives; 21. Underlines the importance of a distributed combined heat and power (CHP) or tri-generation network, which in practice allows a doubling of overall energy efficiency; points out, moreover, that heat or cooling storage could add flexibility to the grid during peak hours, allowing production of electricity and heat storage when production exceeds local needs; 22. Calls on Member States, not only to support high efficiency industrial CHP generation, including by changing from fossil fuel to biomass, but also, for those which have of district heating infrastructure, to promote the use of CHP by supporting the establishment and refurbishment of district heating systems through appropriate financing and regulatory measures; 23. Considers it to be necessary in waste treatment processes to avoid biogas and heat losses through recovery and generation of steam and/or electricity. Takes the view that waste treatment plants without any form of heat recovery or production of energy should not be granted permits; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/71 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "24. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s ongoing work on smart grids and smart meters; considers it important to ensure a long-term and stable harmonised regulatory environment for smart grids and smart meters; urges the Commission to support and incentivize the development of smart grids and smart meters by setting common standards, which have to include requirements on privacy, data and frequencies; recommends that Smart Grids task force within the Commission, takes due account of the opinions of all stakeholders; asks the Commission to provide Parliament with regular progress reports on its work; 25. Welcomes the Commission's work \u2018towards a single energy network\u2019 and, in that connection, calls on the Commission to submit practical proposals to simplify and speed up authorisation procedures for priority infrastructure projects; 26. Calls on the Commission to step up cooperation between the EU and energy grid operators (expanded role for ENTSO) with the aim of improving cross-border grid connections and performance; 27. Asks the Commission to support and promote the setting up and development of a European high- voltage direct current (HVDC) grid able to optimise the harnessing of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and hydropower. This grid would provide long-range energy transmission at low energy loss, while making possible a synergy among all renewable energy sources; Urban development and buildings 28. Supports a multi-level, decentralised approach to energy efficiency policy; highlights that energy efficiency can play a decisive role in the development of urban and rural areas; underlines the need to increase support for initiatives which focus on the local and regional level to enhance energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions such as the Covenant of Mayors and the Smart Cities initiative; stresses the potential of encouragement and implementation of best practices with regard to Energy Efficiency at the level of municipal and regional agencies; furthermore, aligning Cohesion policy with the EU2020 strategy can contribute to smart and sustainable growth in Member States and regions; 29. Calls on the Commission to assess the potential for efficiency in existing buildings starting with public administration buildings including schools and propose a cost-efficient target for the reduction of the primary energy consumption of buildings; calls on the Member States to implement practicable programmes to support deep renovations by which the energy demand will initially be reduced by more than 50 % over pre-renovation performance and where the level of financial and/or fiscal and other, support is propor\u00ad tionally linked to the level of improvement; asks that Member States should be required to include set annual refurbishment targets in their national action plans on Energy Efficiency and calls on the Commission to propose policy options on how to achieve a nearly zero level building stock in the context of the 2050 energy roadmap; 30. Calls on the Commission to broaden the scope of buildings policy to encompass eco-districts, with a view to ensuring that resource optimisation at local level results in lower primary energy consumption in buildings and reduced costs for consumers; 31. Believes it is essential that the homes of energy poor households are improved to the highest possible energy efficiency standards and without raising the daily costs for the energy poor; Stresses that this will often require substantial investment in homes but will on the same time generate a lot of non energy benefits, e.g. by reduced mortality, improved general wellbeing, lower levels of indebtedness and reducing healthcare costs by reducing indoor pollution and thermal stress; 32. Calls on the Commission and Member States to use investment grade audits in order to assess the quality of Energy Performance Certificates; based on these assessments, calls on the Commission to provide guidelines for Member States to ensure the quality of their Energy Performance Certificates and of the energy efficiency improvement of the measures undertaken as a result of recommendations from these certificates; EN C 169 E/72 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "33. Is convinced that it is key for achieving the energy savings target that public authorities at national, regional and local level lead the way; calls on public authorities to go well beyond the requirements set in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, in particular by renovating their existing stock as early as possible to a level comparable to nearly zero energy standard, where technically and economically feasible; acknowledges on the other hand that existing budgetary restrictions in particular at regional and local level often limit the capability of public entities to invest up front; calls on the Commission and the Member States to facilitate and promote the emergence of innovative solutions to address this problem including Energy Performance Contracting or market-based instruments, as well as inviting public authorities to consider cost-savings through multi-annual budget frameworks where this is not being done already; 34. Acknowledges the pioneering role of the European Union; believes that the EU institutions and agencies should set an example, in particular in those buildings that have been identified as having an energy efficiency potential, by refurbishing these buildings in a cost-efficient manner to nearly zero level by 2019 as part of a wider audit of energy use by the institutions; 35. Acknowledges the potential of energy savings in buildings, both in cities and rural areas; notes that various barriers exist for energy refurbishments in particular in the residential sector, such as upfront costs, split incentives or complex negotiations in multi-apartment buildings; asks for innovative solutions to removing these barriers, such as district refurbishment plans, financial incentives and technical assistance; stresses that EU schemes should provide incentives for retrofitting buildings to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and address only buildings with an energy efficiency potential; asks to promote refur\u00ad bishment techniques which are more economical while ensuring a high level of savings; 36. Stresses the importance of reducing high fuel costs to poorer households by supporting deep refurbishment to drive down energy consumption and expenses; asks the competent authorities at local, regional, national and EU level to pay particular attention to the social housing by ensuring that additional costs of energy savings investments are not passed to vulnerable tenants; 37. Asks the Commission to promote new initiatives in support of building refurbishments in the context of the forthcoming innovation strategy, such as an innovation partnership on energy efficiency in energy-efficient/zero-emissions cities; 38. Encourages Member States to promote the replacement of certain non-heritage inefficient buildings, where refurbishment would not be sustainable or cost-effective; 39. Calls on the Member States to accelerate the introduction of Energy Performance Certificates which are issued in an independent manner by qualified and/or accredited experts, as well as to create one-stop shops providing access to technical advice and support as well as financial incentives available at regional, national and European level; 40. Asks the Commission and the Member States to ensure the wider use of energy audits and structured processes for energy management in companies and industrial buildings and to devise mechanisms for assisting SMEs; thereby supporting the enhancement or establishment of national schemes or voluntary agreements; 41. Calls on the Commission to pull in all the resources necessary in order to consult widely, so as to avoid a backlash with Member States, before coming forward by 30 June 2011 with its comparative methodology framework for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive; believes that once in place, the comparative methodology will motivate market players to invest in energy-efficient solutions; 42. Asks the Commission to propose energy benchmarks or requirements with regard to the installation of street lighting by public authorities including the use of smarter controls and energy saving use patterns by 2012; urges that these measures include specification on total lifetime costs for all public procurement of lighting installations; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/73 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "43. Urges Member States to systematically use energy efficient public procurement practices; takes the view that defining energy efficiency systematically as an award criterion in public procurement and making it a condition for publicly funded projects would give this policy a major push; ICT and products 44. Calls on the Commission to develop a Product Policy that ensures greater consistency between environmental product policies by better coordinating the articulation, revision and implementation of the different policy instruments, to foster greater dynamism in market transformation and more meaningful consumer information on energy savings; calls therefore on the Commission to revise the Ecodesign and Energy Labelling directives together (i.e. advancing the revision date of the energy labelling directive); ideally Ecolabel and Green Public Procurement rules should also be revised at the same time and implemented in coordination with Ecodesign and Energy Labelling measures; 45. Calls for the rapid and proper implementation of the Directives on Ecodesign and Energy Labelling and regrets current long delays; suggests clearer and stricter deadlines for adoption, by proposing imple\u00ad menting or respectively delegated acts covering new energy-related products; regrets that the Commission up until now has not exploited the full potential of the Ecodesign Directive and strongly believes that it should cover more products including, if appropriate, new household appliances, ICT, energy-related products for use in buildings (such as industrial electrical motors, machinery, air conditioning, heat exchangers, heating and lighting equipment and pumps), industrial and agricultural equipment, building materials, and products for the efficient use of water; calls on the Commission to take into account the differences between consumer goods and investment goods when adopting implementing acts, and to prove the energy saving potential and practicability before issuing implementing acts; urges that energy efficiency minimum requirements within the eco-design directive include specification of total lifetime costs and emissions for all products including the recycling process; 46. Calls on the Commission to combine existing European legislation such as the Eco-Design-Directive and the Energy Labelling Directive, in order to implement EU legislation most efficiently and make use of synergies, especially for the consumer; 47. Calls on the Commission to take concrete initiatives to improve the resource efficiency of products such as through legislative measures; (+ENVI paragraph 35)notes that improving resource efficiency would also lead to significant energy efficiency gains. 48. Insists that more emphasis should be given to an analysis of the consequences of energy efficiency standards including the link between price and the quality of the end products, the effects of energy efficiency and the benefits for consumers; recognises that the Commission analyses all these effects but insists that the Commission and Member States must put much more effort on communication and control of all products including imports, such as for example energy efficient light bulbs; 49. Finds in this context that uniform technical standards are the appropriate means of achieving higher market penetration for energy efficient products, pumps and engines, etc.; 50. Calls on the Commission to make sure that legislation addresses products, systems and their energy use and considers it necessary to increase the awareness of EU citizens including relevant sales professionals, regarding the energy and resource efficiency of consumer and energy-related products; considers that when evaluating energy consumption, single products and components should be considered as a whole rather than individually; 51. Emphasises that Europe should be at the cutting edge in the development of energy related Internet and ICT low-carbon technologies and applications; stresses that ICT can and should play a major role in promoting responsible energy consumption in households, transport, electricity generation and distribution as well as in the ICT sector itself (accounting for some 8 % of electricity consumption); calls therefore to assess in particular the energy efficiency potential of data centres; considers that enhanced support for innovation must always be accompanied by a reduction of red tape for applicants; acknowledges the need to support partnerships between the ICT sector and major emitting sectors to improve the energy efficiency and emissions of these sectors; EN C 169 E/74 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Underlines that the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to the road transport sector and its interfaces with other modes of transport will make a significant contribution to improving energy efficiency, safety and security of road transport and even more if it is combined with logistics improvements and other rationalisation of transport, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure a coordinated and effective deployment of e-Freight and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) within the Union as a whole; 59. Stresses that in order to meet the energy-efficiency targets mentioned above, it is crucial to invest in the transport sector, especially railway and urban transport systems, in order to minimise the use of the more energy-demanding ones; 60. Stresses the need for increasing the energy efficiency of the overall transport system by a modal shift from high energy intensive transport modes such as trucks and cars to low energy intensive ones such as rail, cycling and walking for passengers or rail and environmentally friendly shipping for freight; 61. Recognises that greater fuel efficiency in vehicles can lower fuel consumption considerably, asks the European Commission to evaluate the progress being made to reach emission reductions for different transport modes and secure a long term planning horizon, in particular in the automotive sector and road transport by setting further targets, if appropriate, and promoting further energy efficiency standards, such as for mobile air conditioning and is of the opinion that the EU should aim at realising efficiency gains that are leading in the world; notes that consumer information and advertising can have an important part to play in orienting consumers towards more efficient purchase choices and driving habits; 62. Calls on the Commission to promote the development and the use of innovative devices to improve energy efficiency (e.g. spoilers for trucks and other forms of improved aerodynamics, or functioning) for all means of transport in a cost-efficient manner; 63. Encourages, in this context, the promotion of the use of energy-efficient tyres without compromising on safety and asks the Commission to set minimum energy efficiency requirements for vehicles purchased by public authorities and tyres fitted on those vehicles; asks the Commission to present by the end of 2011 a strategy for lowering the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions of heavy duty vehicles, which are currently barely addressed; 64. Calls on the Commission to consider adopting a single mandatory pan-European system of labelling for passenger vehicles which would have a positive effect on reducing market distortions, increasing public awareness in Europe and assisting technological innovation in reducing energy consumption and pollutant emissions from vehicles; also calls on the Commission to examine the possibility of extending the proposed single labelling system to include electric and hybrid vehicles; 65. Calls on the Commission to ensure, at the latest by mid 2011, framework conditions for the development of electric vehicles, notably concerning standardisation of infrastructures and charging tech\u00ad nologies which will guarantee interoperability and safety of infrastructures and promote putting into place of charging infrastructure in the Member States; calls furthermore on the Commission to set up harmonised requirements for the approval of electric vehicles, with specific regards to health and safety, for both workers and end-users; calls on the Commission to ensure comparable framework conditions for the development of vehicles using fuel cells or other more sustainable energy sources; 66. Reiterates the need to promote inter-modal transport solutions as well as the development of intelligent transport systems in order to achieve energy savings in the transport sector (including congestion charging, traffic management information technologies, train infrastructure, etc); 67. Asks Member States to abolish tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-inefficient cars and replace them with tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-efficient cars; 68. Acknowledges that the deployment of modular road trains is a sustainable solution which contributes to a higher energy efficiency level in the road transport sector; further acknowledges that the EN C 169 E/76 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",
        "diverging set of rules which modular road trains encounter when crossing country borders are detrimental for an increased use of this method of road transport; calls upon the Commission to inquire which differences in rules can easily be bridged and how an increased level of cross-bordering transport by modular road trains can be ensured; 69. Believes that price signals are crucial in order to increase energy efficiency and that a revised Energy taxation should be part of the revised Energy Efficiency Action Plan, as the use of economic instruments is the most cost-effective way of promoting energy savings; Incentives and financing 70. Reminds the Commission and Member states of the trias energetica, according to which energy demand should be reduced before any investment in additional energy supply is agreed; 71. Calls on the Commission to submit a report on the need for further financial assistance in order to increase energy efficiency in the existing building stock and which evaluates current financial instruments; the Commission should put forward proposals on how to establish an EU framework of revolving financial instruments to support or guarantee complementary energy efficiency measures, existing national schemes and distribution channels (e.g. by means of risk sharing) and to encourage the setting-up and improvement of energy efficiency schemes in Member States; asks the Commission to propose within the EEAP policy options on how to ensure that energy efficiency funds are in place at national, regional or local level; considers that these funds could, i.e. through financial intermediaries, play an important role in the devel\u00ad opment of such instruments, which would deliver financing possibilities to private property owners, SMEs and ESCOs; supports the idea that such instruments promote greater support for more demanding energy- saving measures; 72. Believes that, while developing this framework, attention should be given to all financial resources available in the Member States, in order to create synergies and avoid overlaps with other financial instruments; 73. Welcomes the support given in the Europe 2020 Strategy to shifting the tax burden to energy and environmental taxes which can create incentives to consumers and the industry for energy efficiency and job creation; invites the Member States to consider the possibility to reduce VAT rates for energy efficiency refurbishment works; 74. Calls on the Commission to submit an annual report on whether and how appropriate (fiscal and subsidy-linked) incentives at national level were created, such as, in the private sphere and in SMEs, depreciations of small-scale industrial equipment up to EUR 10 000 or, in the industrial sphere, progressive depreciations of 50 % in the first year or the creation of appropriate investment incentives and of research subsidies, in order to push forward energy efficiency measures; 75. Highlights the EU ETS as an enormous resource potential for energy efficiency investments; recognises that billions of Euros will be raised by auctioning of EU emission allowances; reminds that according to the ETS directive at least 50 % of these revenues should go to adaption and mitigation measures including energy efficiency; stresses that these revenues as well as revenues from carbon taxation should be prioritised for cost-effective energy efficiency financing and technology diffusion; notes furthermore that EU companies are buying millions of CDM credits, mostly in China and India, while they could be investing in CDM in Least Developed Countries or energy efficiency in Europe; 76. Considers that this framework should take into account experience of existing revolving instruments provided by public financial intermediaries, involve existing EU funds and be designed to attract other public or private funds to create the highest leverage possible; considers that the European Commission cannot always be the sole source of all financial resources; calls upon the commission to fulfil a key role in unlocking and leveraging funding that is available in both public and private financial institutions; considers that the Commission should encourage financial institutions as well as funding programs such as the European Investment Bank to give high priority to innovative energy efficiency initiatives, especially when these contribute to other EU goals such as job growth; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/77 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Recognises the lack of upfront finance as a major barrier to building refurbishment in the residential and SME sectors and calls on the Commission to list innovative solutions and best practice in overcoming this problem such as successful \u2018pay as you save\u2019 mechanisms, revolving funds and green investment banks (on the model of KfW in Germany or Caisse Depots in France); 78. Acknowledges that one of the greatest obstacles to realising energy efficiency at local and regional level is the need to invest upfront; is convinced that any measure taken at EU level should take due account of the implications for, and budgetary restrictions of, municipalities and regions; therefore recommends the Commission to consult local and regional representatives in order to set up development guidelines in the energy field and to provide financial support to local and regional projects through innovative programmes using existing energy resources and structural funds; 79. Welcomes the agreement between the Parliament and the Council to use uncommitted funds under the EEPR Regulation for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives on the local and regional level; notes, at the same time, that, despite its significant job-creation potential, investment in energy efficiency is receiving undeservedly little support in the European Economic Recovery Programme; 80. Stresses the need to improve the use of existing EU funds such as the ERDF and EAFRD for energy efficiency measures; urges the Member States to make energy efficiency a priority in their operational programmes, and calls on the Commission and the national authorities to develop ways to facilitate the use of structural funds for energy efficiency measures, such as ensuring better information flow to the local level or establishing one-stop shops and finally reminds that those measures should be evaluated and that energy efficiency gains be an important parameter in this evaluation; 81. In the light of the expected revision of the cohesion and regional policy and of the EU Financial Perspective, calls for energy saving to be integrated into the conditionality for granting EU assistance and for consideration to be given to the possibility of directing a higher proportion of the national allocations toward energy efficiency and renewable energy measures; 82. Calls on the Commission to use the mid term review in order to allocate more funds for energy efficiency programmes and to promote the possibility to use up to 15 % of the ERDF for energy efficiency; 83. Stresses the need to develop technical assistance and financial engineering at local and regional authority level in order to support local players in setting up projects \u2013 e.g. by harnessing the EIB\u2019s ELENA technical assistance facility and the experience of ESCOs; 84. Calls on the Commission to strengthen the financing facilities (e.g. ELENA) and to consider setting up complementary facilities funded under the Intelligent Energy Programme; 85. Points out that policies for energy efficiency should be oriented towards involving as many parties as possible, public as well as private, to obtain the largest possible leverage effect, create jobs, contribute to greener growth and encourage the creation of a competitive, connected, and sustainable European market for energy efficiency; 86. Notes that mandating energy companies to fulfil energy saving obligations could provide additional sources of financing for energy efficiency measures, such as wire charges applied to TSOs or DSOs, funds provided by suppliers as a means of fulfilling their obligation, or fines paid for non-fulfilment of require\u00ad ments; 87. Notes that while much of the upfront capital required to deliver energy saving investments will need to come from the private sector, public intervention is needed to help overcome market failures and ensure that the low carbon transition occurs in time to comply with EU renewable energy and emission reduction targets; EN C 169 E/78 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Acknowledges that a well-functioning energy market incentivises energy savings; calls on the Commission to assess and report on the role of energy companies, including Energy Service Companies (ESCO's) in promoting energy efficiency and calls on the Commission and the Member States to take effective measures to push energy companies to invest in energy efficiency and facilitate end-user energy efficiency improvements; calls on the Commission present recommendations based on best practices from which Member States can select the most suitable model for their domestic situation, such as a white certificate scheme, tax reliefs, direct incentives, etc.; 90. Calls on Commission, Member States as well as local and regional levels of government to increase their efforts to enhance education and training of energy efficiency experts of all kinds, but particularly of intermediary technicians, and in all sectors, but especially in the entire building value chain and in SMEs to upgrade skills of construction crafts; thereby creating green local jobs while facilitating the implementation of ambitious energy efficiency legislation; calls in this context for a full exploitation and increase of the structural and cohesion funds for training purposes; 91. Calls on the Commission to examine the applicability of innovative forms of regulation which can effectively combine the substantial potential for energy saving in the new Member States with the capital and technological potential of the more developed Member States; 92. Stresses the need to improve the development of markets for energy services; asks the Commission to consider, when revising the Energy Services Directive, measures to foster energy performance contracting in the public and private sector; Considers that energy services companies are in many respects the best placed to help households, SME\u2019s and the public sector to over-coming the barrier of high up-front investment costs when refurbishing existing buildings for energy efficiency purposes; proposes the Commission to do a study to assess best practices in the Member States as well as identify obstacles and barriers to fully exploiting the potential of the finance mechanism; 93. Points out that enterprises, through their innovation efforts, play a vital role in devising and implementing energy-saving measures; hopes that structural funding will encourage enterprises actively to participate in projects in the field of energy efficiency; 94. Reiterates its request that an energy efficiency chapter should be reinforced within the European neighbourhood policy and included systematically in EU-third country dialogues; 95. Recognises the chances and potential opportunities arising for European undertakings from the development, manufacture and marketing of energy efficient technologies (e.g. for applications in the area of engines and drives, lighting, electrical appliances, etc.); EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/79 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Considers, in this context, the development and placing on the market of innovative technologies to be the basis for improving energy efficiency in all fields of application, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and for increasing the share of renewable energies; 97. Insists that energy efficiency must be a priority under the next Research Framework Programme (FP 8); 98. Calls on the Commission to make energy efficiency one of the key priorities of the 8th Framework Research Programme and to allocate a significant part to energy efficiency sub-programmes similar to the current Intelligent Energy Programme; stresses the need for an increase in the funds for research, devel\u00ad opment and demonstration in the energy area, including a significant increase in the EU\u2019s future budget, particularly for renewable energy, smart grids and energy efficiency, by 2020 compared with the current level; 99. Takes the view that more importance should be given to the significance of energy saving measures in the context of international climate talks; believes that ambitious energy efficiency policies can be better enforced and have less impact on competitiveness if they are harmonised internationally; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to convince the EU's international partners at the forthcoming talks in Cancun of the need for coordinated energy efficiency measures; 100. Endorses the call by the G20 group of countries in its Toronto Summit Declaration of 27 June 2010 for fossil fuel subsidies to be phased out over the medium term, and points out that doing so would liberate billions of Euros which could be redirected to supporting energy efficiency measures, thus contributing far better to the EU's strategic energy objectives of sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply; 101. Considers that the social dimension to the energy dialogue, covering aspects such as human rights, energy poverty and the protection of low income consumers, should always be taken into account while developing energy policies; 102. Recognises that energy efficiency policies have not so far addressed the social acceptance factor sufficiently in the reduction of energy consumption; emphasises that not only is the behaviour of users crucial for the success of energy efficiency measures but consumer trust should also be enhanced; calls for the future energy efficiency action plan to provide additional supporting measures to increase social acceptance; stresses the vital role that regional and local levels can play in reaching consensus; 103. Stresses the importance of an intensified information policy of the Commission and the Member States regarding energy efficiency and energy savings issues towards all relevant stakeholders and calls upon the Commission and the Member States to improve and further facilitate such access to information on energy efficiency and energy savings issues; * * * 104.

Calls on Russia to put a moratorium on the implementation of the 2002 Law on Fighting Extremist Activity as it is used and abused to restrict religious freedom, and to repress and attempt to ban non-violent religious groups; notes furthermore with great concern that 265 religious and faith-based organisations are on a black list of so-called extremist organisations; 136. Urges, furthermore, the following countries to stop restrictions on freedom of association and assembly of religious groups and to respect freedom of religion or belief: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Belarus, North Korea and Laos; 137. Underlines the obstacles still existing in parts of the world such as Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan to the unhindered profession of faith, at both the individual and the collective level, as well as growing intolerance of religious minorities in countries with grounded democratic traditions such as India, and calls on the Commission to emphasise such issues in the context of its relevant political dialogues; 138. Firmly condemns any criminalisation or punishment for \u2018apostasy\u2019 in relation to cases of conversion from one religion to another or from one religious denomination (subgroup) to another, as still carried out in most of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa; calls on the EU institutions to exert pressure on these countries to reject such practices, in particular where capital punishment is the prescribed penalty; is deeply concerned about forced conversion practices still existing in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and asks for a clear commitment on the part of the EU institutions to the fight against such human rights violations; 139.

Encourages the HR/VP to take the lead in adopting a position and developing concrete policies for the EU to act as a global player when it comes to internet freedom by covering not only ways of addressing threats to human rights through the use of new technologies, but also using them as a means of enhancing opportunities to protect and support human rights; 144. Urges countries that limit access to the internet to lift restrictions on the free flow of information; notes that according to \u2018Reporters without Borders\u2019 the \u2018internet enemy list\u2019 includes the following states which engage in pervasive internet censorship: Belarus, China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam; 145. Urges the Commission to draw up a list of individuals responsible for severe human rights viol\u00ad ations, such as torture, censorship, rape and extra-judicial executions, in Iran, particularly after the 2009 elections, and to consider imposing sanctions on them in the form of asset freezes and travel bans; 146.

Condemns terrorism in all its forms; recalls that terrorism worldwide has resulted in thousands of deaths of innocent civilians and has shattered the lives of many families; takes the view that in the case of terrorist attacks it is imperative to talk first and foremost about the rights of the victims and not the perpetrators; stresses the need to make sure that terrorists are brought to justice; 149. Notes that measures to fight terrorism have resulted in violations of basic human rights in a number of countries around the world, in the form of the application of disproportionate surveillance measures, illegal detentions and the use of torture as a means of extracting information from suspected terrorists; expresses concern that certain countries are using the fight against terrorism as a cloak to crack down on ethnic minorities and local human rights defenders, and urges that the fight against terrorism not be used as an argument to restrict or ban the lawful and legitimate action of human rights defenders; condemns these violations of human rights, underlines the EU\u2019s position that the fight against terrorism must be conducted with full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law and is convinced that civil liberties should not be compromised in the fight against terrorism; 150.

Notes that following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty the codecision procedure applies to directives and other forms of legislation on the fight against terrorism and organised crime, whereas international agreements related to this subject will have to be assented to by Parliament; notes that these changes will give Parliament additional leverage on the right balance between security and human rights; undertakes, therefore, to act in line with its new prerogatives by consistently calling for respect for, and promotion of, human rights, civil and political liberties and democracy in all the EU\u2019s relations with non-EU countries and regional organisations; 155. Reiterates that each Member State has a positive obligation to protect identifiable potential victims who are at real and immediate risk of terrorist acts, and adds that all Member States must take all reasonable measures to put in place procedures to prevent terrorist activity and to minimise the collateral impact of counter-terrorism activities; 156. Recalls the EU Council Framework Decision of March 2001 on victims of terrorism: emergency assistance, continuing assistance, investigation and prosecution, effective access to the law and justice, administration of justice, compensation, protection of the private and family life of victims, protection of the dignity and security of victims, information for victims and specific training for those responsible for assisting victims; Human rights dialogues and consultations with non-EU countries 157. Expresses its disappointment at the lack of progress achieved by a number of human rights dialogues and consultations; notes the fact that the involvement of civil society in these dialogues and consultations is not systematically guaranteed and is sometimes subject to constraints imposed by the non- EU parties; is concerned that even when cases are raised, governments are not fulfilling their commitment to report back to the EU on the individual and structural issues raised within the framework of the dialogue; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/103 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",

Calls for strong coordination between EU Member States, the European Commission and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights of every EU human rights dialogue with non-EU countries; points out the need for the EU to be able to tackle human rights violations inside the Union itself if it is to be viewed as a beacon of human rights on the world stage; 167.

Stresses that human rights include, inter alia, the right to food, water and sanitation, education, adequate housing, land, decent work and social security; these rights should be granted as fair access to natural resources on a sustainability basis, including for future generations; recognises that poverty and the lack of good governance are important factors behind many of the situations of non-compliance with such rights; calls for the EU to invest greater efforts in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), given the evidence that the world is falling far short of the goals set for 2015; in this context, reiterates the importance of implementing human-rights-based policies for the realisation of the MDGs; 174.

Stresses the importance of using the EIDHR as a way of reacting to human rights threats and a way of providing increased support to human rights defenders and victims of human rights abuses; supports a network of 11 EIDHR-funded organisations focusing on protecting human rights defenders and responding rapidly in emergency situations; encourages the development of specific strategies to respond to the needs of different categories of human rights defenders, including those defending LGBTI rights and those associated with investigations of human rights and humanitarian law violations; 182.

Reminds Parliament\u2019s delegations to systematically include debates on human rights in the agendas of interparliamentary meetings, to include in their visits projects and institutions seeking to improve respect for human rights, and to meet human rights defenders and provide them, where appropriate, with inter\u00ad national visibility and protection; 194. Welcomes the establishment of the Sakharov Prize Laureates Network; urges that the necessary resources be found without delay to achieve its objectives and to facilitate communication between Sakharov Prize winners and Parliament by granting special status to the prize-winners, allowing them to enter Parliament\u2019s premises with facilitated entrance procedures; * * * 195.

        "K. whereas in July 2010 the US Congress called for an audit on billions of dollars of past funding for Afghanistan and voted for a provisional cut of almost USD 4 billion in aid to the Government of Afghanistan, L. whereas Afghanistan\u2019s Finance Minister, Omar Zakhilwal, has criticised, firstly, NATO/ISAF contracting practices for not benefiting the local Afghan economy and, secondly, ISAF\u2019s one-sided interpretation of the rules on tax-free provisions in the ISAF-Afghan Government agreement, and whereas the Minister has blamed foreign contractors for taking the bulk of ISAF-financed contracts, amounting to up to USD 4 billion, and reportedly causing a constant outflow of money from the country; whereas the Afghan Government is calling for an international investigation, M. whereas it has become obvious that no military solution is possible in Afghanistan, and whereas the US has stated that it will start to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan in summer 2011, other countries have either already withdrawn or are making plans to do so, and others still have not indicated an intention to withdraw; whereas, however, the withdrawal of the military has to be a gradual and coordinated process in the framework of a political project that guarantees a smooth transition of responsibility to the Afghan security forces, N. whereas the Kabul Conference stipulated that the Afghan National Army should reach a personnel complement of 171 600 and the Afghan National Police 134 000 by October 2011, with the necessary financial and technical support from the international community, O. whereas the main objective of the EUPOL Afghanistan mission is to contribute to the establishment of an Afghan police system in accordance with international standards, P. whereas Afghanistan is not only the world\u2019s leading source of opium production and the main supplier to heroin markets in the EU and the Russian Federation, but also one of the world\u2019s leading cannabis producers, according to a recent UNODC report; whereas, however, opium production in Afghanistan has dropped by 23 % in the last two years and by a third since its peak in 2007; whereas UNODC has established that there is a clear correlation between opium cultivation and the territories where the insurgency is in control, and that in the parts of Afghanistan where the government is more able to enforce the law nearly two-thirds of farmers have said they do not grow opium because it is banned \u2013 whereas in the southeast, where the authorities\u2019 reach is weaker, just under 40 % of farmers have cited the ban as a reason for not cultivating poppies, Q. whereas, according to a recent UNODC report, the number of Afghan citizens addicted to drugs has increased sharply in recent years, a trend which will have major social repercussions for the country\u2019s future, R. whereas the EU has played an active role in supporting counter-narcotics efforts from the outset of the reconstruction process, without achieving any significant results in restricting the pervasive influence of the drugs industry on the economy, the political system, state institutions and society, S. whereas some poppy eradication in Afghanistan has been carried out using chemical herbicides, and whereas this practice results in serious harm to people and to the environment in terms of soil and water pollution; whereas, however, there is now a consensus on the need to concentrate repressive measures on the drug trade and heroin-producing labs, and not on farmers; whereas the main effort is currently focused on providing alternative livelihoods for farmers, T. whereas Afghanistan has remarkable natural resources, including rich mineral reserves such as gas and oil, estimated at a value of USD three trillion, and whereas the Afghan Government is relying on these resources to spur economic development after peace and security have been established in the country, EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/111 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "A new EU strategy 1. Is aware of the set of factors hampering progress in Afghanistan but has chosen to focus in this report on four main areas where, it believes, efforts expended could result in improvements: international aid and coordination; the implications of the peace process; the impact of police training; and the elimination of opium cultivation through alternative development; 2. Expresses support for the new concept of a counter-insurgency strategy geared to protecting the local population and rebuilding areas where security has been ensured, and for the EU\u2019s Action Plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan; 3. Believes, therefore, that the EU strategy for Afghanistan will have to take as its starting point two premises: an acknowledgement of the continuing deterioration in security and socio-economic indicators in Afghanistan despite almost a decade of international involvement and investment; and the need to further encourage the shift in the mindset of the international community \u2013 which in the past, and in particular prior to the counter-insurgency strategy, has all too often shaped plans and decisions with scant regard for Afghan involvement \u2013 so that in future its plans and decisions are shaped in close cooperation with the Afghans; notes that the conferences in London and Kabul were an important step in this direction; 4. Welcomes and supports the Council Conclusions of October 2009, entitled \u2018Strengthening EU Action in Afghanistan and Pakistan\u2019 and outlining a more coherent and coordinated EU approach towards the region and highlighting the importance of regional cooperation and of a more civilian focus in the policy towards Afghanistan; 5. Stresses that any long-term solution to the Afghan crisis has to start from the Afghan citizens\u2019 interest in their internal security, civil protection and economic and social development, and should include concrete measures for the eradication of poverty, under-development and discrimination against women, for enhancing respect for human rights and the rule of law, strengthening reconciliation mechanisms, ensuring an end to opium production, engaging in a robust state-building exercise, and fully integrating Afghanistan into the international community, as well as banishing Al-Quaeda from the country; 6. Welcomes the conclusions of the Kabul International Conference on Afghanistan; stresses that commitments by the Afghan Government to improve security, governance and economic opportunities for Afghan citizens, as well as the commitments by the international community to support the transition process and the shared objectives, need to be respected; 7. Reiterates that the EU and its Member States should support Afghanistan in the reconstruction of its own state, with stronger democratic institutions capable of ensuring national sovereignty, security based on a democratically accountable army and police, a competent and independent judiciary, state unity, territorial integrity, equality between men and women, media freedom, an emphasis on education and health, sustainable economic development and the prosperity of the people of Afghanistan, and respect for the historical, religious, spiritual and cultural traditions and rights of all ethnic and religious communities on Afghan territory, while recognising the need for fundamental change in the attitude towards women; calls for more support to be given to local-authority development projects in those provinces where there is evidence of good governance; 8. Notes that 80 % of the population is settled in rural areas, and that arable land per capita diminished from 0,55 ha in 1980 to 0,25 ha in 2007; highlights the fact that Afghanistan continues to be highly vulnerable to adverse climatic conditions and to rising food prices on the world market, while the wide\u00ad spread and indiscriminate use of landmines poses a significant risk to successful rural development; considers, in this context, that it is of primary importance to continue and enhance funding geared towards rural development and local food production, in order to achieve food security; 9. Takes note of the Afghan Government\u2019s commitment to implementing over the next 12 months, in a phased and fiscally sustainable manner, the Sub-National Governance Policy, strengthening local authorities and their institutional capacities and developing sub-national regulatory, financing, and budgetary frame\u00ad works; EN C 169 E/112 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "10. Notes that more substantial Afghan involvement in the rebuilding process can be hampered by weak public administration and civil service capacity; is therefore convinced that more attention needs to be paid to these important areas; welcomes the idea that the Commission and the Member States should devise a special long-term flagship programme to address the issue of strengthening public administration by developing a curriculum, helping to build or use existing premises, linking up with the network of EU public administration institutes, as well as mentoring civil service institutes in a number of metropolitan cities in Afghanistan such as Kabul, Herat and Mazar i Sharif; 11. Points out that development efforts must focus on improving the capabilities of Afghan government structures and that the Afghans themselves must be closely involved both in setting priorities and during the implementation phases, with a view to fostering the process of taking ownership and responsibility at national and community level; draws attention, therefore, to the essential role of civil-society organisations in ensuring that Afghan citizens are involved in the process of democratisation and reconstruction and in guarding against the risk of corruption; 12. Remains deeply concerned, despite some improvements in women\u2019s lives since the end of the Taliban rule in 2001, about the general situation regarding human rights in Afghanistan and particularly about the deterioration in women\u2019s fundamental, political, civil and social rights over the past few years, and expresses its concern about negative developments such as the fact that the majority of prisoners in Afghan jails are women escaping oppressive relatives, and about the recent changes to the electoral code which reduce the quotas for parliamentary seats for women; 13. Believes that women\u2019s rights are part of the security solution and that it is impossible to achieve stability in Afghanistan without women enjoying their full rights in political, social and economic life; calls, therefore, on the Afghan authorities and the representatives of the international community to include women in every stage of the peace talks and reconciliation/reintegration efforts, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 1325; calls for special protection to be provided for women who are publicly or politically active and therefore endangered by fundamentalists; points out that progress in the peace talks may not, under any circumstances, involve any loss of the rights acquired by women in recent years; calls on the Afghan Government to improve the protection of women\u2019s rights by amending existing legislation, such as the criminal code, to avoid discriminatory practices; 14. Calls on the Commission, the Council and EU Member States to continue to raise the issues of discrimination against women and children, and of human rights in general, in bilateral relations with Afghanistan, in line with the Union\u2019s long-term commitment to assisting Afghanistan in peace and recon\u00ad struction efforts; 15. Calls on the EU and the international community to increase the level of funding and political and technical support for policies to improve the situation of Afghan women and non-governmental women\u2019s organisations, including those defending women\u2019s rights; 16. Notes that, despite improvements since the fall of the Taliban regime, the situation has worsened in recent years with regard to freedom of expression and of the press; notes that armed groups and the Taliban attack and threaten journalists to prevent them reporting on areas under their control; calls for action to be taken in this field to allow journalists to exercise their profession with certain safety guarantees; 17. Notes with concern that the parliamentary elections which took place in Afghanistan on 18 September 2010, with a turnout of around 40 % despite the security conditions in the country, were, once again, marred by fraud and violence, in which, according to NATO, 25 people lost their lives; regrets that many Afghans have been prevented from exercising their fundamental right to vote; 18. Notes irregularities in the country\u2019s judicial processes, which do not comply with international standards of justice; deplores the execution in 2008 of 16 people sentenced to death; calls on the EU to seek approval for a moratorium on the death penalty, in accordance with UN Resolution 62/149 of 2007, with a view to its subsequent abolition; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/113 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "International aid \u2013 use and abuse 19. Recalls that the combined EU (European Community and Member States) budget for aid to Afghanistan for the period 2002-2010 totalled around EUR 8 billion; 20. Highlights the importance of strengthening media freedom and civil society in Afghanistan to enhance democratisation in the country; also commends the conclusions of the 2009 EU Election Obser\u00ad vation Mission; 21. Notes that, despite the huge injections of foreign aid, the situation in Afghanistan continues to be discouraging, preventing humanitarian and medical aid from reaching the most vulnerable sections of the population, that more Afghans are dying through poverty than as a direct result of the armed conflict, and that, shockingly, infant mortality has risen since 2002, while life expectancy at birth and levels of literacy have declined markedly, and that since 2004 the number of people living below the poverty threshold has increased by 130 %; 22. Emphasises the importance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals and deplores the fact that, although progress has been made in some areas, Afghanistan\u2019s ranking in the UNDP Human Devel\u00ad opment Index has descended from 173 in 2003 to 181 (out of 182 countries), while mortality rates among children aged under five and maternal mortality rates in Afghanistan remain among the highest in the world; considers that specific objectives in these areas, and on access to health and education, in particular for women, should not be neglected, but urges that special attention be paid to improved income generation and the construction of a functioning justice system; 23. Underlines the revelation by UNODC in its study of January 2010 that corruption is the biggest concern of the population and that revenues generated by bribery amount to almost one quarter (23 %) of Afghanistan\u2019s GDP; 24. Calls on the Commission to ensure transparency and accountability in relation to the financial assistance provided to the Afghan Government, international organisations and local NGOs, in order to ensure the coherence of aid and the success of Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development; 25. Calls for humanitarian aid to be distributed on a geographically more homogenous basis, in the light of an analysis of needs and in keeping with the requirement for urgency; 26. Notes, however, the limited progress made on infrastructure, telecommunications and basic education \u2013 usually cited by donors and the Afghan Government as areas of achievement; 27. Draws attention to the huge cost of the war prosecuted in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2009, estimated at over USD 300 billion and equivalent to more than 20 times Afghanistan\u2019s GDP, and set to rise to over USD 50 billion per year with the additional military \u2018surge\u2019 that is foreseen; 28. Acknowledges the widespread perception that Afghan Government corruption is solely responsible for the lack of provision of essential services to citizens, but also notes that the majority of resources for socio-economic development have been channelled through international organisations, regional devel\u00ad opment banks, NGOs, international contractors, consultants etcetera, and not through the central Government; urges the Afghan Government and the international community to exercise greater control in order to eliminate corruption and to ensure that aid reaches its target; 29. Takes the view that the fight against corruption should be at the core of the peace-building process in Afghanistan, since bribery causes misallocation of resources, constitutes an obstacle in terms of access to basic public services such as health and education, and represents a huge impediment to the country\u2019s socio- economic development; emphasises likewise that corruption undermines confidence in the public sector and the government, and consequently constitutes a major threat to national stability; therefore, urges the EU, when providing assistance to Afghanistan, to pay special attention to the fight against corruption; EN C 169 E/114 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "30. Notes that, according to the Afghan Minister of Finance, as corroborated by other independent sources, only USD 6 billion (or 15 %) out of a total of USD 40 billion in aid actually reached the Afghan Government between 2002 and 2009, and that, of the remaining USD 34 billion, which was channelled through international organisations, regional development banks, NGOs, international contractors, etcetera, between 70 % and 80 % never reached the intended beneficiaries, the people of Afghanistan; notes the decision taken at the Kabul Conference that 50 % of the international aid should be channelled through the Afghan national budget by 2012, in accordance with Afghanistan\u2019s request; 31. Points out the urgent need to establish coordination mechanisms among international donor countries and to provide for detailed evaluations of European and international aid to combat the lack of transparency and the limited mechanisms for donor accountability; 32. Condemns the fact that a significant proportion of European and other international aid money is lost along the distribution chain \u2013 a situation drastically highlighted in the recent scandal around the Kabul Bank \u2013 and draws attention to the four main ways in which this happens: waste, excessive intermediary and security costs, overbilling and corruption; 33. Notes, however, that EU losses are mitigated by the fact that 50 % of the Union\u2019s aid (as compared with 10 % of US aid) is allocated through multilateral trust funds, whose rate of effectiveness is very high (around 80 %); 34. Calls on the EU to set up a centralised database on, and to analyse the costs and impact of, all EU aid to Afghanistan, as the lack of comprehensive, up-to-date and transparent data undermines aid efficiency; 35. Calls, too, on all the main humanitarian and development bodies active in Afghanistan, including the EU and its Member States, the US, UNAMA, the UN agencies, the main NGOs and the World Bank, drastically to prune their operating expenses by allocating funds to concrete projects implemented in real and balanced partnership with Afghan institutions, and to ensure that aid actually reaches its target; emphasises, in that regard, that Afghan institutions shall have the right to decide on the use of the funds, while ensuring due transparency and accountability; 36. Stresses the importance of coordinating reconstruction and development efforts at regional level in order to promote cross-border development in a region where ethnic and tribal links often transcend national borders; 37. Notes that increased involvement by Afghan local and regional governments should be promoted, and emphasises that, at this level, allegiance, the rule of law and democracy are imperative for the proper use of funds; points out that the allocation of funds at local and regional level shall require the approval of the central Government, thus enhancing its role and responsibility; 38. Calls on the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, the Council and the Commission to set up a joint team of researchers to evaluate all EU and Member State measures and missions in Afghanistan once a year, using explicit qualitative and quantitative indicators, especially with regard to development aid (including public health and agriculture), good governance (including the justice sector and respect for human rights) and security (especially the training of Afghan police); calls too, in this context, for an evaluation of the relative impact of EU measures on the overall situation in the country and of the level of coordination and cooperation between EU bodies and other international missions and measures, and for the findings and recommendations of such an evaluation to be published; 39. Stresses that the security situation and the geographical distribution of assistance are mutually dependent and calls, therefore, for help to be dispatched directly to the population in Afghanistan immediately affected; 40. Stresses that combating corruption in Afghanistan must be a priority; recognises that local corruption exists but hopes that this will be countered through strengthening the legitimacy of Afghan state institutions by making them responsible for approving the allocation of funding and ensuring the effectiveness of aid; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/115 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "41. Advocates a policy of increasing procurement within Afghanistan itself wherever possible rather than importing goods or services; 42. Takes the view that impartial humanitarian bodies should be responsible for the distribution of aid in the country and that military personnel should be involved only in entirely exceptional circumstances, in recognition of the neutral, impartial and independent nature of the work of humanitarian bodies and in full compliance with the relevant international standards, as codified in the \u2018Guidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets in Humanitarian Emergencies\u2019 (MCDA) and advocated in the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid; 43. Points out that any perceived breach of the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence by such bodies in their work makes them more vulnerable on the ground, particularly as they will continue to be present on the ground long after troops have been withdrawn; 44. Notes that, as widely reported in the press and in the US House of Representatives report \u2018Warlord, Inc.\u2019, the US military in Afghanistan has outsourced most of its logistics to private contractors, who in turn subcontract the protection of military convoys to local Afghan security providers, with disastrous consequences; 45. Notes that the decision to place the US military supply chain in private hands without any reliable criteria for assuring accountability, transparency and legality is fuelling extortion and corruption, as warlords, local mafia bosses and ultimately Taliban commanders end up taking a significant share of the USD 2.2-3 billion business of military logistics in Afghanistan; 46. Is appalled by the fact that protection money and extortion at every level of the military supply chain constitute the most significant source of funding for the insurgency, as recognised by US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in her testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December 2009; 47. Is equally appalled by the fact that, since US and NATO/ISAF military logistics follow similar lines, the full traceability of EU financial contributions might not be fully guaranteed in all cases; 48. Fully welcomes the new guidelines issued in September 2010 by the NATO military command in Afghanistan on contracting \u2013 currently worth around an estimated USD 14 billion per year \u2013 which aim to reduce corruption and decrease the funds that flow indirectly to the insurgency and the Taliban; hopes this change of orientation in contracting policy will be implemented quickly; 49. Welcomes, in this context, the recent decree by President Karzai setting a four-month deadline for all local and foreign private security firms in Afghanistan to cease operation; The peace process 50. Stresses that good governance, the rule of law and human rights are the foundations for a stable and prosperous Afghanistan; stresses, therefore, that a credible justice process is a fundamental aspect of the peace process and that respect for human rights and the prevention of widespread impunity should be non- negotiable aspects at all stages of the peace process; calls, in this respect, on the Afghan Government to implement a judicial reform strategy as a matter of priority; 51. Believes that much of the blame for the present stalemate in Afghanistan rests with early miscalcu\u00ad lations made prior to the new counter-insurgency strategy by coalition forces who foresaw a speedy military victory over the Taliban and an easy transition to a stable country run by a legitimate government with strong Western backing; 52. Believes, consequently, that the presence of the Taliban was underestimated and the ability of the Karzai government to provide governance overestimated, and that, as a result, little attention was paid to the task of rebuilding and developing the country; EN C 169 E/116 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "53. Fears that these errors have fuelled the resurgence of the Taliban in over half the country, exacer\u00ad bating the deterioration in security in the entire region and in respect for human rights, particularly those of women; 54. Points out that the military focus of the past did not achieve the desired results, and therefore strongly supports a more civilian approach; 55. Recognises that the only possible solution is a political one and that this should include negotiations \u2013 which should eventually take place against the backdrop of a ceasefire \u2013 with the Taliban and other combatant groups, as well as other political players in the country, who are ready to participate in a government of national unity capable of putting an end to the civil war that has raged there for almost three decades and of ensuring full respect for the rule of law and fundamental human rights; believes that, in order to achieve the political solution, the new counter-insurgency policy must be given time to show results in line with the timetable announced by President Obama; 56. Firmly believes that the EU\u2019s three main prerequisites for such a peace process and the involvement of Taliban groups must be a commitment by all parties involved in negotiations to banish from the country Al-Qaeda and its promotion of international terrorism, as well as any other terrorist group; to take action to eliminate poppy cultivation; and to establish a policy of promoting and respecting fundamental human rights and the Afghan Constitution; 57. Believes, too, that all other issues should be left to the will and capacity of the Afghan people themselves; 58. Recognises that the Taliban are not a single uniform entity and that there are at least 33 top leaders, 820 mid-level/junior leaders, and 25 000 to 36 000 \u2018foot soldiers\u2019 distributed among 220 communities, some fighting for ideological and others for monetary reasons; believes, therefore, that negotiations should, from now on, be encouraged at local level between the democratically elected local government and members of the armed opposition \u2018who renounce violence, have no links to international terrorist organi\u00ad sations, respect the Constitution and are willing to join in building a peaceful Afghanistan\u2019, in accordance with paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Kabul communiqu\u00e9 of 20 July 2010; 59. Welcomes the Afghan Government\u2019s Peace and Reintegration Programme, which is open to all Afghan members of the armed opposition and their communities on the basis of the above-mentioned paragraphs 13 and 14 of Kabul communiqu\u00e9; 60. Points out that any disarmament and reintegration strategy must take close account of the problem of the return of ex-combatants and refugees to their villages of origin; 61. Highlights the importance of increasing the credibility, responsibility and competence of the Afghan Government and administration, in order to improve its reputation among its own citizens; 62. Stresses the key role of Pakistan, as there is no incentive for the Taliban to undertake any serious negotiations as long as the Pakistan border remains open to them; recommends wider international coor\u00ad dination and involvement in the process, including that of other neighbouring countries and leading regional players \u2013 notably Iran, Turkey, China, India and the Russian Federation; 63. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the strategic and political implications for Afghanistan and the broader region of the recent disastrous floods in Pakistan, and to take every necessary step to assist the affected population of the country and the Afghan refugees whose camps were overwhelmed by the flooding; 64. Stresses the importance of good water management in and around Afghanistan and highlights the benefits of regional and cross-border cooperation in this field, inter alia in terms of confidence-building among neighbours in South-West Asia; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/117 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "65. Notes the involvement of the Pakistan Intelligence Service (ISI) aimed at making sure that Pakistan, too, gets a satisfactory outcome from any peace dividend; 66. Stresses, however, that for peace to be allowed to take root in Afghanistan will require political deals among key regional powers, including India, Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian States, Russia, China and Turkey, and a common position of non-interference and support for an independent Afghanistan; calls, too, for normalisation of the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan, namely through a final settlement on the issue of the international border between the two countries; 67. Calls on the EU to continue to support the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan as well as Afghan efforts to reintegrate those ready to renounce violence, allowing the Karzai Government enough flexibility in its choice of dialogue partners, but insisting that the Afghan Constitution and respect for fundamental human rights form the overall legal and political framework for the peace process; 68. Welcomes the National Priority Programmes prepared by the Afghan Government in line with the Afghanistan National Development Strategy and supported by the Kabul Conference, and calls for their full and effective implementation; 69. Cannot stress strongly enough the need for a much more active EU role in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, as no lasting peace is possible in the country itself or in the region as a whole without significant poverty reduction and sustainable development; recognises that there is no development without security, as there is no security without development; 70. Urges the EU and its Member States to work together with the United States to channel more of the international aid effort through domestic authorities and the Kabul Government, and to ensure that drones, special forces and local militias against Taliban leaders are used according to General Petraeus' orders for zero tolerance on the loss of innocent civilians\u2019 lives; 71. Pays tribute to the servicemen and women of all the Allied Forces who have lost their lives in defending freedom, and expresses its condolences to their families, as well as to the families of all innocent Afghan victims; 72. Points out that the military presence of some EU Member States and their allies in Afghanistan is part of the NATO/ISAF operation and its objectives of combating the threat of international terrorism and tackling drug cultivation and trafficking; 73. Stresses that this presence can help create the security conditions that would allow for recent plans by the Afghan Government to exploit the country\u2019s potentially vast mining and minerals industry to be put into practice, thus providing it with sorely needed own resources for the national budget; 74. Stresses that the potentially vast mining and minerals resources on Afghan territory belong exclusively to the people of Afghanistan, and that \u2018protection\u2019 of these assets can never be used as an excuse for the permanent presence of foreign troops on Afghan soil; Police and the rule of law 75. Notes that there can be no stability or peace in Afghanistan without the state first of all guaranteeing security for its citizens on its own responsibility; 76. Welcomes President Karzai\u2019s objective that, by the end of 2014, only the Afghan National Security Forces should lead and conduct military operations in all provinces, as well as the Afghan Government\u2019s commitment to a phased exercise of full authority over its own security; EN C 169 E/118 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "77. Stresses that Afghanistan must be provided with an efficient police force and an autonomous army capable of ensuring security so as to permit a subsequent withdrawal of the foreign military presence from the country; 78. Sees merit in General Petraeus\u2019s idea that local, democratically elected authorities could be given a local gendarmerie to maintain law and order and protect the local population; 79. Recognises, however, that having self-sustaining security forces is a somewhat long-term goal and therefore draws particular attention to the need for a more coordinated and integrated approach in the training of police, as well as, separately, the training of army officers, and draws attention to the funding being invested in police training, with limited results; calls on all those involved to coordinate their work closely in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and to fulfil complementary tasks at strategic and oper\u00ad ational levels; 80. Highlights the need for a comprehensive reform of the Interior Ministry, without which the efforts to reform and build a new police force could fail, and points in this context to the importance of monitoring, support, advice and training at Interior Ministry, regional and provincial level, in line with a further objective of EUPOL; 81. Believes that the undeniable vagueness of EUPOL\u2019s remit and its limited achievements to date prevent it from acquiring the leading EU role it deserves; deplores the fact that three years after its deployment EUPOL still has not reached three-quarters of its authorised strength; and reiterates its call to the Council and the EU Member States to honour in full their commitments towards this mission; 82. Welcomes the setting up by EUPOL Afghanistan of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office with the aim of investigating cases against high-profile public officials and other officials suspected of corruption; 83. Is disturbed by the ISAF figures indicating that of the 94 000 men in the Afghan National Police almost 90 % are illiterate, 20 % are drug users, and over 30 % go missing after a year, not to mention the 1 000 or so killed in service every year; 84. Believes that major factors behind the ineffectiveness of the overall training are a lack of coordination of the various aspects of police training and the practice of transferring duties to private military and security companies (PMSC); 85. Notes that the commitment by the EU and its Member States to the creation of a professional Afghan police force risks being compromised by the prevalence of practices such as the \u2018fast-track\u2019 approach (poor vetting of recruits, six weeks of training with no textbooks because of trainee illiteracy, minimal field training, recruits then given a badge, uniform and gun and sent out on patrol) implemented by a few big US security companies; emphasises the need for more coherent and sustainable police training enabling different Afghan police forces to work together; stresses that police training missions should not only focus on technical aspects but must guarantee recruits\u2019 literacy and give them a basic knowledge of national and international law; 86. Is disturbed to learn of the poor financial controls being applied to these private companies, and cites a 2006 joint US Defense and State Department report, the findings of which are still valid today, concluding that the police force in Afghanistan was incapable of carrying out routine law enforcement work and that no effective field training programme existed; acknowledges the attempts by the general command, and under the counter-insurgency policy, to exercise some degree of control over the private foreign militias operating with impunity in Afghanistan; 87. Recommends that police training should, as soon as possible, cease to be carried out by private contractors; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/119 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "88. Calls for improved international cooperation and coordination to increase police training capacities significantly and to further improve the effectiveness of training programmes; proposes that a large-scale training programme be launched by EUPOL and NATO/ISAF, incorporating the national police units as agreed with the Afghan Government and thereby eliminating duplication, waste and fragmentation; 89. Urges the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and the EU Member States to intensify police training in Afghanistan and to increase significantly the number of police trainers on the ground so that the objective of the London Conference to reach 134 000 trained Afghan police officers by the end of 2011 becomes a realistic scenario; urges the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy to amend EUPOL Afghanistan\u2019s mission by also mandating training for low-grade personnel in all provinces, by increasing the number of weeks dedicated to basic training, and by ensuring that patrols and other policing activities are conducted jointly in the field; urges the EU Member States not only to merge their bilateral police training mission with EUPOL but also to refrain from imposing caveats for national police deployed in EUPOL; 90. Recommends that salaries for the Afghan police be increased and that the whole recruitment process be reviewed, giving preference to recruits with a basic standard of literacy who are not drug users and are better qualified psychologically and physically than the present cohort; 91. Stresses that police training cannot deliver without a properly functioning judiciary and calls, therefore, on the international community to provide increased financial and technical support to strengthen the judicial system, including through an increase in the salary of judges at all levels; further requests the Council to put in place, in coordination with the UN, a specialised mission to train judges, as well as public officials in the Ministry of Justice and the penal system, in Afghanistan; 92. Welcomes the fact that the Afghan Government pledged at the Kabul Conference to improve, with the support of international partners, access to the delivery of justice throughout the country by imple\u00ad menting concrete measures within the next 12 months, as well as the capacity of judicial institutions, including through the design and implementation of a comprehensive human resources strategy; Narcotics 93. Points out that Afghanistan is the source of 90 % of the world\u2019s illicit opium, and yet that when coalition forces entered Kabul in 2001 no opium poppies were being grown in Afghanistan owing to the UN\u2019s success in achieving a ban on their cultivation; 94. Opines that a large, well-resourced military force should, subsequently, have found it easy to sustain this opium-free situation through local agricultural development projects, protected by its troops against the Taliban and local warlords; 95. Notes, however, that opium production is still a key social, economic and security issue, and calls on the EU to consider this as a strategic priority in its policies towards Afghanistan; 96. Points out that more than 90 % of heroin in Europe originates from Afghanistan and that the cost to public health in European countries runs into billions of dollars; emphasises that the challenges posed by the drug economy in Afghanistan must be tackled not only nationally but internationally by addressing all links in the drug chain and that this requires, in particular, assistance to farmers to reduce supply, as well as drug prevention and treatment to curb demand, and law enforcement against the intermediaries; proposes, in particular, massive investment in the establishment of a comprehensive agricultural and rural policy to offer opium producers a credible, lasting alternative; insists also on the need to integrate environment into the agriculture and rural strategy, as degradation of the environment \u2013 caused for instance by poor management of water resources or the destruction of natural forest \u2013 is one of the main barriers to the development of the agricultural economy; 97. Notes that, as a result of the impunity given to growers and traffickers, within two years cultivation reached pre-2001 levels, with a small number of powerful warlords running a huge cartel; EN C 169 E/120 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "98. Expresses deep concern at the sharp increase, indicated in the recent UNODC report, in the number of Afghans addicted to drugs; calls for targeted measures to be taken immediately to reduce the number of drug addicts and provide them with medical care; with this in view, stresses the need to fund programmes to set up rehabilitation centres in the country, particularly in those areas which do not have access to medical treatment; 99. Points out that, despite an earlier dip in prices caused by excessive production, in 2009 trade in narcotics totalled USD 3,4 billion and the potential gross export value of opium was 26 % of Afghanistan\u2019s GDP, with around 3,4 million Afghans (12 % of the population) said to be involved in the illicit narcotics industry; 100. Draws attention, however, to the findings of the recent UNODC report indicating that the Taliban net only 4 % of the profits from the annual narcotics trade, and local farmers 21 %, with 75 % going to government officials, the police, local and regional brokers, and traffickers; notes, in short, that NATO\u2019s Afghan allies are in fact getting the lion\u2019s share of the profits from the drugs trade; 101. Notes that between 2001 and 2009 the US and the international community spent USD 1.61 billion on counter-narcotics measures without having any significant impact on production and trafficking, and recalls Richard Holbrooke, US Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, describing US counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan to date as \u2018the most wasteful and ineffective programme I have seen in and out of government\u2019; 102. Points out that, unless the dependence of the Afghan economy on drugs is ended once and for all and a viable alternative economic growth model found, the goals of restoring security and stability to the region will not be achieved; 103. Emphasises the importance of efforts to phase out opium cultivation in Afghanistan \u2013 which have had little success so far \u2013 and calls, in this connection, for viable alternative livelihoods to be provided for the 3,4 million Afghans who make a living from opium, and for the situation of rest of the Afghan rural population to be improved; 104. Notes successful attempts in Pakistan, Laos and Thailand to phase out the cultivation of opium through its replacement by alternative crops; notes, too, the emergence in Afghanistan of promising new crops, such as saffron, that can deliver a much higher income than opium poppies; 105. Notes that a similar process of phasing out opium poppy cultivation could be envisaged for Afghanistan at a cost of EUR 100 million per year by specifically earmarking 10 % of the EU\u2019s annual aid to the country for a period of five years; 106. Notes that the recently signed Afghanistan-Pakistan Trade and Transit Agreement will give an opening to producers of pomegranates, the most famous legal crop in the area, and one repeatedly been cited by foreign development workers as a key to creating decent alternative livelihoods for poppy-growers in the south of Afghanistan; 107. Commends UNODC for its active work to support the Government of Afghanistan in its struggle against illicit drugs, and calls for the strengthening of UNODC and its programmes in Afghanistan; 108. Calls for a five-year national plan for the elimination of illicit opium crops, with specific deadlines and benchmarks, to be implemented through a dedicated office with its own budget and staff; 109. Stresses that this plan should be promoted through cooperation between the EU and the Russian Federation, the latter being the major victim of Afghan heroin and the world\u2019s second-largest opioids market after the EU; 110. Calls on the Government and Parliament of Afghanistan to enact specific legislation aimed at prohibiting all eradication practices that may involve the use of non-manual and non-mechanical means; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/121 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",

Recognises that, while it is in the interest of all Member States that a workable crisis mechanism is established, not all Member States will be members or candidate members of the euro area by the time such a mechanism is set up, and notes that their particular situations should be clarified, especially for those moving towards the euro area and which have sovereign debt in euros; recalls that non-euro area members benefit from the balance of payments facility under Article 143 TFEU; 11. Notes therefore that Member States outside the euro area should be involved in the creation of such a mechanism and that those Member States which are willing to participate in the mechanism should have such a possibility; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/125 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",

Stresses that this strict and incremental conditionality should serve to restore sustainable growth and not be achieved at the expense of the most vulnerable and therefore should not equate to lowering minimum incomes and aggravating poverty and inequalities; 14.

Insists that rules should be adapted to provide for case-by-case participation of private-sector creditors, fully consistent with IMF policies; 16.

Calls on the Commission to maintain the requirement for a ban on battery cages by 1 January 2012, as laid down in the Welfare of Laying Hens Directive (1999/74/EC), and strongly to oppose any attempts by Member States to secure a deferral of that deadline; 2. Stresses that, as a matter of principle, postponement of the ban or derogations from it would seriously harm the welfare of laying hens, distort the market and penalise those producers who have already invested in non-cage or enriched-cage systems; believes, nevertheless, that a solution should be found, subject to clearly defined conditions, for those producers who have started to change their rearing systems, by intro\u00ad ducing new cages or alternative rearing methods, but who will not have completed this process by 1 January 2012; 3. Expresses its deep concern at the substantial numbers of Member States and egg producers behind schedule for meeting the 2012 deadline; 4. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention to meet the main stakeholders and competent authorities in January 2011 in order to assess the state of play regarding implementation of the directive, but stresses that these efforts are long overdue; 5. Calls on the Commission urgently to provide clarity concerning the state of play in the Member States and reveal, at the latest by 1 March 2011, the measures it envisages taking in order to ensure compliance with the directive; 6. Emphasises that such measures should, first and foremost, maintain a level playing field and protect producers who are compliant by 1 January 2012 against unfair competition from producers inside and outside the EU who continue unlawfully to use battery cages after that date; 7. Calls on the Commission to monitor progress at frequent intervals and to take urgent action directed at Member States to make sure that their egg producers comply with the ban by 1 January 2012 and to urge them to develop national action plans, including dissuasive sanctions, with a view to ensuring that the use of battery cages is brought to an end on their territory by 1 January 2012; 8. Believes that egg producers and Member States that have made the effort to comply with Directive 1999/74/EC should not be penalised through unfair and illegal competition, in particular in the form of eggs and egg products imported from third countries; emphasises that eggs not produced in compliance with Directive 1999/74/EC cannot be legally marketed or be part of internal trade in the EU; urges the Commission, therefore, to take measures to avoid trade distortions and prevent non-compliant producers from exporting beyond their national territory; 9. Insists that the Commission should take no action against a Member State which prevents the marketing and import of eggs which have not been produced in accordance with EU law; 10. Notes that some, but not all, Member States have made use of the possibility of providing funding for producers to support the conversion to enriched cages; stresses, however, that the current constraints on the finances of some Member States and the difficulties faced by EU farmers in obtaining bank loans to finance on-farm investment may make the process of converting to enriched cages before 1 January 2012 more difficult; EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/131 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",

Underlines the need to raise consumer awareness about this issue and about the effects of non- compliance in terms of the welfare of laying hens and unfair competition between farmers; 13. Notes that eggs should be regarded as a basic and staple food and points out that non-compliance with Directive 1999/74/EC may give rise to a risk of egg shortages and significant price increases for consumers; emphasises, further, that such shortages and price increases could lead to increased imports of eggs or egg products from third countries that do not observe EU welfare standards; 14. Asks the Commission to step up its monitoring of the enforcement of the directive by means of more frequent inspections by the Food and Veterinary Office; 15. Requests the Commission to submit, at the latest by 31 December 2011, a list of egg and egg- product producers, processors and retailers not complying with the provisions of Directive 1999/74/EC; 16.

Addresses the following recommendations to the Council: (a) acknowledges that the inclusion of civil protection and humanitarian aid within the portfolio of a single Commissioner responsible for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response creates better synergies within the Commission and helps enhance the coherence of the overall EU disaster response; (b) calls for greater integration between civil protection and humanitarian working methodologies within DG ECHO, while preserving their specific features by maintaining a clear distinction and demarcation of roles between them, in order to maximize synergies and complementarities and to enhance efficiency; calls also for military and civilian personnel and humanitarian workers involved in disaster response or humanitarian operations to act in accordance with the principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality; (c) reiterates that the use of civil protection resources, where deployed in any humanitarian crisis, should be needs driven and complementary to, and coherent with, humanitarian aid, in accordance with the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid and the United Nations guidelines (Oslo guidelines), with a view to ensuring compliance with the humanitarian principles of neutrality, humanity, impartiality and independence; (d) insists that EU assistance in the event of natural or man-made disasters should aim, wherever possible, at helping the local economy, for example by purchasing locally or regionally produced foodstuffs as well as providing the necessary materials for farmers in order to relaunch the rural economy; (e) asks the Council and the Commission to clarify the arrangements for cooperation and coordination between the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission for the management of a large-scale disaster response outside the territory of the European Union; (f) suggests localised coordination efforts, in cooperation with the national government of the affected state, using EU and Member States' representatives on the ground to ensure a targeted and competent response to affected localities; (g) urges the Council to strengthen the EU\u2019s disaster response capacity as a high priority, especially in view of the discussions on setting up an EU Civil Protection Force, and to follow up the European Parlia\u00ad ment\u2019s repeated requests that the proposals put forward in the Barnier report in 2006 should be implemented; (h) calls for the immediate establishment of an EU Civil Protection Force which must be adequately equipped with the necessary technological and technical resources; (i) calls also, in the context of operations following a natural disaster, for better coordination between the humanitarian agencies and the civil protection mechanisms of the Member States and DG ECHO, and any future European civil protection force; (j) urges the Commission to develop programs with national governments, local authorities and civil society organisations in beneficiary countries with regard to community-based disaster prevention and response management capacity; EN C 169 E/142 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",

Stresses that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment; reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures restructuring companies or sectors; 4. Notes that the information provided on the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded from the EGF includes detailed information on the complementarity with actions funded by the Structural Funds; reiterates its call to present a comparative evaluation of these data in its annual reports as well, including an evaluation of the effects these temporary and personalised services have on the long-term reintegration into the labour market of the workers who have been made redundant; 5. Welcomes the fact that, in the context of mobilising the EGF, an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund has been proposed by the Commission, following the frequent reminders by the European Parliament that the EGF was created as a separate specific instrument with its own objectives and deadlines and that appropriate budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified; 6. Notes however that, in order to mobilise the EGF for this case, payment appropriations will be transferred from a budget line dedicated to the support of SMEs and innovation; regrets the severe short\u00ad comings of the Commission when implementing the programmes on competitiveness and innovation, particularly during an economic crisis which should significantly increase the need for such support; 7.

(2) Article 82(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union shall be based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions. (3) According to the Stockholm programme, adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 10 and 11 December 2009, mutual recognition could extend to all types of judgments and decisions of a judicial nature, which may, depending on the legal system, be either criminal or administrative. It also calls on the Commission and the Member States to examine how to improve legislation on and practical support measures for the protection of victims. The programme also points out that victims of crime can be offered special protection measures which should be effective within the Union. This Directive forms part of a coherent and comprehensive set of measures on victims\u2019 rights. (4) The resolution of the European Parliament of 26 November 2009 on the elimination of violence against women calls on the Member States to improve their national laws and policies to combat all forms of violence against women and to act in order to tackle the causes of violence against women, not least by employing preventive measures and calls on the Union to guarantee the right to assistance and support for all victims of violence. The resolution of the European Parliament of 10 February 2010 on equality between women and men in the European Union \u2013 2009 endorses the proposal to introduce the European protection order for victims. (5) In a common area of justice without internal borders, it is necessary to ensure that the protection provided to a natural person in one Member State is maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person moves or has moved. It should also be ensured that the legitimate exercise by citizens of the Union of their right to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Article 21 of the TFEU, does not result in a loss of their protection . (6) In order to attain these objectives, this Directive should set out rules whereby the protection stemming from certain protection measures adopted according to the law of one Member State (\u2018the issuing State\u2019) can be extended to another Member State in which the protected person decides to reside or stay (\u2018the executing State\u2019). \u2590 EN C 169 E/176 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 ( 1 ) Position of the European Parliament of 14 December 2010. Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "(7) This Directive takes account of the different legal traditions of the Member States as well as the fact that effective protection can be provided by means of protection orders taken by an authority other than a criminal court. This Directive does not establish obligations to modify national systems for adopting protection measures. (8) This Directive applies to protection measures which aim at protecting a person against a criminal act of another person which may, in any way, endanger his or her life, physical, psychological and sexual integrity, such as by preventing any form of harassment, as well as his or her dignity or personal liberty, such as by preventing abductions, stalking and other forms of indirect coercion, and aiming at avoiding new acts of crime or at reducing the consequences of previous acts of crime. These personal rights of the protected person amount to fundamental values recognised and upheld in all Member States. It is important to underline that this Directive applies to protection measures which aim at protecting all victims and not only the victims of gender violence, taking into account the specificities of each type of crime concerned. (9) This Directive applies to protection measures, independently of the nature \u2013 criminal, civil or administrative \u2013 of the judicial or equivalent authority that adopts the decision concerned, be it in the context of criminal proceedings or in the context of any other proceedings with regard to an act which has been or could have been the object of proceedings by a court having jurisdiction in particular in criminal matters. (10) This Directive is intended to apply to protection measures issued in favour of victims, or possible victims, of crimes; it should not apply to measures issued with a view to witness protection. (11) If a protection measure, as defined in this Directive, is issued for the protection of a relative of the main protected person, a European protection order may also be requested by and issued with regard to this relative, subject to the conditions laid down in this Directive. (12) Any request for the issuing of a European protection order should be treated with adequate speed taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the case, including the urgency of the matter, the date foreseen for the arrival of the protected person on the territory of the executing State and, where possible, the degree of risk for the protected person. (13) Where information is to be provided under this Directive to the person causing danger or to the protected person, this information should also be provided to the guardian or to the representative of the person concerned where relevant. Due attention should also be paid to the need for the protected person, the person causing danger or their representative in the proceedings, to receive information, as provided for by this Directive, in a language they understand. (14) In the procedures for the issuing and recognition of a European Protection order, competent auth\u00ad orities should give appropriate consideration to the needs of victims, including particularly vulnerable persons, such as. minors or persons with disabilities. (15) For the application of This Directive, a protection measure may have been imposed following a judgment, as defined by Article 2 of Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions ( 1 ), or following a decision on supervision measures as defined in Article 4 of Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA of 23 October 2009 on the application, between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention ( 2 ).

        "(16) In conformity with Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and with Article 47, paragraph 2, of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the person causing danger should be provided, either in the procedure leading to the adoption of a protection measure or before issuing a European protection order, with the possibility to be heard and to challenge the protection measure. (17) In order to prevent a crime or new crime being committed against the victim in the executing State, that State should be given a legal basis for recognising the decision previously adopted in the issuing State in favour of the victim, while also avoiding the need for the victim to start new proceedings or to produce evidence in the executing State again as if the issuing State had not adopted the decision. The recognition of the European protection order by the executing State implies inter alia that the competent authority of that State, subject to the limitations set out in this Directive, accepts the existence and validity of the protection measure adopted in the issuing State, acknowledges the factual situation described in the European protection order, and agrees that protection should be provided and should be continued to be provided in accordance with its national law. (18) This Directive contains a closed number of obligations or prohibitions which, when imposed in the issuing State and contained in the European protection order, should be recognised and enforced in the executing State, subject to the limitations set out in this Directive. Other types of protection measures may exist at national level, such as, if provided by national law, the obligation on the person causing danger to remain in a specified place. Such measures may be imposed in the issuing State in the framework of the procedure leading to the adoption of one of the protection measures which, according to this Directive, may be the basis for a European Protection Order. (19) Since in the Member States different kind of authorities (civil, criminal or administrative) are competent to issue and enforce protection measures, it seems appropriate to provide a high degree of flexibility in the cooperation mechanism between the Member States under this Directive. Therefore, the competent authority in the executing State does not in all cases have to take the same protection measure as adopted in the issuing State, but it has a degree of discretion to adopt any measure which it would deem adequate and appropriate under its national law in a similar case in order to provide continued protection to the protected person in the light of the protection measure adopted in the issuing State, and as described in the European protection order. (20) The obligations or prohibitions to which this Directive applies include, among others, measures aimed at limiting personal or remote contacts between the protected person and the person causing danger, for example by imposing certain conditions on such contacts or imposing restrictions on the contents of communications. (21) The competent authority of the executing State should inform the person causing danger, the competent authority of the issuing State and the protected person of any measure taken on the basis of the European protection order. In the notification of the person causing danger due regard should be taken of the interest of the protected person in not having his or her address or other contact details disclosed. Such details should be excluded from the notification, provided that the address or other contact details are not comprised in the obligation or prohibition imposed as an enforcement measure on the person causing danger. (22) When the competent authority in the issuing State has withdrawn the European protection order, the competent authority in the executing State should end the measures which it has adopted in order to enforce the European protection order, it being understood that the competent authority in the executing State may - autonomously, according to its national law - adopt any protection measure under its national law in order to protect the person concerned. (23) Given that this Directive deals with situations in which the protected person moves to another Member State, executing its provisions does not imply any transfer to the executing State of powers relating to principal, suspended, alternative, conditional or secondary penalties, or relating to security measures imposed on the person causing danger, if the latter continues to reside in the State that issued the protection measure. EN C 169 E/178 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "(24) Where appropriate, it should be possible to use electronic means with a view to putting into practice the measures adopted in application of this Directive, in accordance with national laws and procedures. (25) In the framework of cooperation among the authorities involved in ensuring the safeguard of the protected person, the competent authority of the executing State should communicate to the competent authority of the issuing State any breach of the measures adopted in the executing State with a view to executing the European protection order. This communication should enable the competent authority of the issuing State to promptly decide on any appropriate reaction with respect to the protection measure imposed in its State on the person causing danger. Such reaction may comprise, where appropriate, the imposition of a custodial measure in substitution of the non- custodial measure originally adopted, for example as an alternative to preventive detention or as a consequence of conditional suspension of a penalty. It is understood that such decision, since it does not consist in the imposition ex novo of a criminal sanction in relation to a new criminal offence, does not interfere with the possibility that the executing State may, where applicable, impose criminal or non-criminal sanctions in the event of breach of the measures adopted in order to execute the European protection order. (26) Considering the different legal traditions of the Member States, where no protection measure would be available in the executing State in a case similar to the factual situation described in the European protection order, the competent authority of the executing State should report any breach of the protection measure described in the European protection order of which it is aware to the competent authority of the issuing State. (27) In order to achieve the smooth application of this Directive in each particular case, the competent authorities of the issuing and the executing States should exercise their competencies in conformity with the provisions of this Directive, taking into account the principle of ne bis in idem. (28) The protected person should not be required to sustain costs for the recognition of the European protection order which are disproportionate with respect to a similar national case. When imple\u00ad menting this Directive, Member States should ensure that, after and as a direct consequence of the recognition of the European protection order, the protected person should not be required to initiate further national proceedings to obtain from the executing authority the decision adopting any measure that would be available under its national law in a similar case in order to ensure the safeguard of the protected person. (29) Bearing in mind the principle of mutual recognition on which this Directive is based, Member States should promote to the widest extent possible direct contact between the competent authorities in the application of this instrument. (30) Without prejudice to judicial independence and differences in the organisation of the judiciary across the Union, Member States should consider requesting those responsible for the training of judges, prosecutors, police and judicial staff involved in the procedures aiming at issuing or recog\u00ad nising a European protection order to provide appropriate training with respect to the objectives of this Directive. (31) In order to facilitate the evaluation of the application of this Directive, Member States should communicate to the Commission relevant data related to the application of national procedures on the European protection order, at least on the number of European protection orders requested, issued and/or recognised. In this respect, other types of data, such as for example the types of crimes concerned, would also be useful. (32) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to protect persons who are in danger, cannot be suffi\u00ad ciently achieved by the Member States alone, given the cross-border nature of the situations involved, and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/179 Tuesday 14 December 2010 ",
        "(33) This Directive should contribute to the protection of persons who are in danger, thereby comple\u00ad menting but not affecting the instruments already in place in this field, such as Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA and Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA. (34) When a decision relating to a protection measure falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( 1 ), Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility ( 2 ), or the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children ( 3 ), the recognition and enforcement of that decision should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of that legal instrument. (35) Member States and the Commission should include information about the European protection order, where it is appropriate, in existing education and awareness-raising campaigns on the protection of victims of crime. (36) Personal data processed when implementing this Directive should be protected in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters ( 4 ) and in accordance with the principles laid down in the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, which all Member States have ratified. (37) This Directive should respect the fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union and by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, in conformity with Article 6 of the TEU. (38) When implementing this Directive, Member States are encouraged to take into account the rights and principles enshrined in the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Objective This Directive sets out rules allowing a judicial or equivalent authority in a Member State, in which a protection measure has been issued with a view to protecting a person against a criminal act of another person which may endanger his or her life, physical or psychological integrity and dignity, personal liberty or sexual integrity, to issue a European protection order enabling a competent authority in another Member State to continue the protection of the person concerned in the territory of this Member State, following the commission in the issuing State of an act which has been or could have been the object of proceedings by a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters in particular.

Is of the opinion that, although the draft budget as modified by Council does not entirely meet the real need for a sustainable, coherent and efficient Union budget, Parliament's objective is to provide the Union with a budget that can be fully and predictably implemented from the beginning of the financial year; 2. Considers the way the EU system of own resources has evolved, gradually being replaced by national contributions and consequently being perceived as an excessive burden on national public finances, renders its reform more necessary than ever; takes note of the Commission's Declaration; reiterates nevertheless the importance of the Commission presenting by 1 July 2011 substantive proposals for new own resources for the EU, based on Article 311 TFEU, and calls for a commitment by the Council to discuss these proposals with Parliament within the negotiating process for the next multiannual financial framework (MFF), in line with Declaration No. 3 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006; 3. In line with Article 314(4) TFEU, considers some reserves on appropriations to be necessary to help the Commission to improve transparency of information and implementation of appropriations under Section III of the budget; approves the draft budget for 2011 as modified by Council's position; 4.

ANNEX JOINT STATEMENT ON PAYMENT APPROPRIATIONS \u2018Taking into account the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in Member States, the European Parliament and the Council agree on the level of payment appropriations for 2011 as proposed in the Commission's draft budget of 26 November 2010. They ask the Commission to submit an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2011 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure under sub-heading 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment), sub-heading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment), heading 2 (Preservation and management of natural resources), heading 3 (Citizenship, freedom, security and justice) and heading 4 (EU as a global player). In particular, the European Parliament and the Council urge the Commission to present by the end of September 2011 at the latest updated figures concerning the state of play and estimates regarding payment appropriations under sub-heading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment) and rural development under heading 2 (Preservation and management of natural resources), and, if necessary, to present a draft amending budget for this sole purpose. The European Parliament and the Council will take position on any draft amending budget as quickly as possible in order to avoid any shortfall in payment appropriations. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council undertake to process swiftly any possible transfer of payment appropriations, including across financial framework headings, in order to make the best possible use of payment appropriations entered in the budget and align them to actual execution and needs.\u2019 EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/201 Wednesday 15 December 2010 ",

Stresses that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment; reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures restructuring companies or sectors; 4. Notes that the information provided on the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded from the EGF includes detailed information on the complementarity with actions funded by the Structural Funds; reiterates its call to present a comparative evaluation of these data in its annual reports as well; 5. Welcomes the fact that, in the context of mobilising the EGF, an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund has been proposed by the Commission, following the frequent reminders by the European Parliament that the EGF was created as a separate specific instrument with its own objectives and deadlines and that appropriate budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified; 6.

Recalls that the functioning and the added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the IIA of 17 May 2006 within the process of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework mid-term review; 8.

It is also to be open to them at any other time, subject to compliance with the acts already adopted within that framework, in addition to those conditions. The Commission and the Member States participating in enhanced cooperation should ensure that they promote partici\u00ad pation by as many Member States as possible.

The agreement on the choice of applicable law should at least be expressed in writing, dated and signed by both parties. However, if the law of the participating Member State in which the two spouses have their habitual residence lays down additional formal rules, those rules must be complied with. For example, such additional formal rules may exist in a participating Member State where the agreement is inserted in a marriage contract. (17) Rules on material and formal validity should be defined so that the informed choice of the spouses is facilitated and that their consent is respected with a view to ensuring legal certainty as well as better access to justice. As far as formal validity is concerned, certain safeguards should be introduced to ensure that spouses are aware of the impli\u00ad cations of their choice. The agreement on the choice of applicable law should at least be expressed in writing, dated and signed by both parties. However, if the law of the partici\u00ad pating Member State in which the two spouses have their habitual residence at the time the agreement is concluded lays down additional formal rules, those rules should be complied with. For example, such additional formal rules may exist in a participating Member State where the agreement is inserted in a marriage contract. If, at the time the agreement is concluded, the spouses are habitually resident in different participating Member States which lay down different formal rules, compliance with the formal rules of one of those States would suffice. If, at the time the agreement is concluded, only one of the spouses is habitually resident in a participating Member State which lays down additional formal rules, those rules should be complied with.

These connecting factors have been chosen so that the divorce or legal separation proceeding is governed by a law with which the spouses have a close connection , and they are based first and foremost on the law of the spouses\u2019 habitual residence .

Such continuity would promote predictability for the parties and increase legal certainty. If the law applied to the legal separation does not provide for the conversion of legal separation into divorce, the divorce should be governed by the conflict-of-law rules which apply in the absence of a choice by the parties.

In such a case, the court should not be obliged to pronounce a decree of divorce by virtue of this Regulation. Where this Regulation refers to the circumstance that the law of the participating Member State whose court is seised does not deem the marriage in question valid for the purposes of divorce proceedings, this should be interpreted as meaning inter alia that such a marriage does not exist under the law of that Member State.

        "Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 1 ), After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) aims at an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe and Article 167 TFEU in particular gives the European Union the task of contributing to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore. Furthermore, Article 167(2) TFEU specifies that, in accordance with the principle of propor\u00ad tionality, the Union is to contribute to improvement of the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples. (2) A better understanding and appreciation, especially among young people, of their shared yet diverse heritage would help to strengthen the sense of belonging to the European Union and reinforce intercultural dialogue. It is therefore important to promote greater access to cultural heritage and to enhance its European dimension. (3) The TFEU also establishes citizenship of the Union, which complements national citizenship of the respective Member States, and which is an important element in safeguarding and strengthening the process of European integration. For citizens to give their full support to European integration, greater emphasis should be placed on their common values, history and culture as key elements of their membership of a society founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural and linguistic diversity, tolerance and solidarity. (4) An intergovernmental European Heritage Label scheme was launched in Granada in April 2006 by several Member States and Switzerland. (5) The Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on 20 November 2008 ( 3 ) aimed at trans\u00ad forming the intergovernmental European Heritage Label into a European Union action by inviting the Commission to submit to it an appropriate proposal for the creation of a European Heritage Label by the European Union and to specify the practical procedures for the implementation of the project. (6) The public consultation and the impact assessment carried out by the Commission confirmed that the intergovernmental European Heritage Label was a valuable initiative but that the action needed to be further developed to reach its full potential, and confirmed that the involvement of the European Union could provide a clear added value to the European Heritage Label and help the initiative to take a qualitative step forward. (7) The European Heritage Label should benefit from the experience hitherto gathered from the intergovernmental initiative. EN C 169 E/224 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 ( 1 ) OJ C 267, 1.10.2010, p. 52. ( 2 ) Position of the European Parliament of 16 December 2010. ( 3 ) OJ C 319, 13.12.2008, p. 11. Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "(8) The European Heritage Label should seek to supplement but not duplicate initiatives such as the UNESCO World Heritage List , the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity and the Council of Europe\u2019s \u2018European Cultural Routes\u2019. The added value of the new European Heritage Label should be based on the contribution made by the selected sites to European history and culture , including the creation of the Union , on a clear educational dimension reaching out to citizens, especially young people, and on networking between the sites to share experiences and best practices. The main focus of the initiative should be on the promotion of, and access to, the sites, thereby contributing to a shared historical and cultural heritage within the Union, and on the quality of the explanations given and of the activities proposed, rather than on the conservation of the sites, which should be guaranteed by existing protection regimes. (9) In addition to strengthening EU citizens\u2019 sense of belonging to the Union and stimulating inter\u00ad cultural dialogue, a Union action for the European Heritage Label could also contribute to enhancing the value and profile of cultural heritage, to increasing the role of heritage in the economic and sustainable development of regions, in particular through cultural tourism, to fostering synergies between cultural heritage and contemporary creation and creativity, to facilitating the sharing of experiences and best practices across Europe, and more generally, to promoting the democratic values and human rights that underpin European integration. (10) Those objectives are fully in line with the objectives of the European agenda for culture, which include fostering cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue and the promotion of culture as a catalyst for creativity ( 1 ). (11) It is crucial that the new European Heritage Label should be awarded on the basis of common, clear and transparent criteria and procedures. (12) Member States should be able to pre-select sites which have already been awarded the European Heritage Label under the intergovernmental European Heritage Label scheme. Those sites should be assessed on the basis of the new criteria and procedures. (13) Future evaluations of the European Heritage Label could examine the possibility of extending the initiative to include third countries participating in the Culture Programme. (14) The administrative arrangements for the European Heritage Label should be light and flexible in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. (15) Since the objectives of this Decision cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the need, in particular, for new common, clear and transparent criteria and procedures for the European Heritage Label, as well as a stronger coordination between the Member States, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Subject-matter This Decision establishes a European Union action entitled \u2018the European Heritage Label\u2019.

ANNEX STATEMENT BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION Article 5(2) of this Regulation requires the Commission to adopt a draft implementing act where the committee delivers a positive opinion. This provision does not preclude that Commission may, as is the current practice, in very exceptional cases, take into consideration new circumstances that have arisen after the vote and decide not to adopt a draft implementing act, after having duly informed the committee and the legislator. EN 15.6.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 169 E/235 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION The Commission will proceed to an examination of all legislative acts in force which were not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to assess if those instruments need to be adapted to the regime of delegated acts introduced by Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Commission will make the appropriate proposals as soon as possible and no later than at the dates mentioned in the indicative calendar annexed to this declaration. While this alignment exercise is underway, the Commission will keep the European Parliament regularly informed on draft implementing measures related to these instruments which should become, in the future, delegated acts. As regards legislative acts in force which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the Commission will review the provisions attached to this procedure in each instrument it intends to modify, in order to adapt them in due course according to the criteria laid down in the Treaty. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council will be entitled to signal basic acts they consider important to adapt as a matter of priority. The Commission will assess the results of this process by the end of 2012 in order to estimate how many legislative acts containing references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny remain in force. The Commission will then prepare the appropriate legislative initiatives to complete the adaptation. The overall objective of the Commission is that, by the end of the 7th term of the Parliament, all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny would have been removed from all legislative instruments. The Commission notes that it has recently launched a study which will provide a complete and objective review of all aspects of the EU's trade defence policy and practice, including an evaluation of the performance, methods, utilisation and effectiveness of the present TDI scheme in achieving its trade policy objectives, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the existing and potential policy decisions of the European Union (e.g., the Union interest test, the lesser duty rule, the duty collection system) in comparison with the policy decisions made by certain trading partners and an examination of the basic anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations in light of the administrative practice of the EU institutions, the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The Commission intends, in the light of the results of the study and of developments in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations to explore whether and how to further update and modernize the EU's trade defence instruments. The Commission also recalls the recent initiatives it has taken to improve the transparency of the operation of trade defence instruments (such as the appointment of a Hearing Officer) and its work with Member States to clarify key elements of trade defence practice. The Commission attaches substantial importance to this work, and will seek to identify, in consultation with the Member States, other initiatives which could be taken in this respect. Under the comitology rules based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC, where a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) management committee has delivered an unfavourable opinion, the Commission must submit the draft measure in question to the Council which may take a different decision within a month. However, the Commission is not barred from acting but has the choice to either put the measure in place or defer its application. Hence, the Commission may take the measure where it considers on balance that suspending its application would for instance provoke irreversible negative market effects. When afterwards the Council decides otherwise the measure put in effect by the Commission becomes of course redundant. Thus the current rules equip the Commission with an instrument that allows protecting the common interest of the whole Union by adopting a measure at least on an interim basis. Article 7 of this Regulation pursues the objective of maintaining this approach within the new comitology arrangements but limited to exceptional situations and on the basis of clearly defined and restrictive criteria. It would allow the Commission to adopt a draft measure despite the unfavourable opinion of the examination committee provided that its \u2018non adoption within an imperative deadline would create a significant disruption of the markets (\u2026) or for the financial interests of the Union.\u2019 The provision refers to situations where it is not possible to wait until the committee votes again on the same or another draft measure because in the meantime the market would be significantly disrupted e.g. due to the speculative behaviour of operators. To ensure the Union's ability to act it would give Member States and the Commission the opportunity to have another informed discussion on the draft measure without leaving things undecided and open to speculation with the negative consequences for the markets and the budget. EN C 169 E/236 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2012 Thursday 16 December 2010 ",
        "Such situations may namely arise in the context of the day-to-day management of the CAP (e.g. fixing of export refunds, management of licences, special safeguard clause) where decisions need often to be taken quickly and can have significant economic consequences for the markets and thus farmers and operators but also for the budget of the Union. In cases where the European Parliament or the Council indicate to the Commission that they consider a draft imple\u00ad menting act to exceed the implementing powers provided for in the basic act, the Commission will immediately review the draft implementing act taking into account the positions expressed by the European Parliament or the Council. The Commission will act in a manner which takes duly into account the urgency of the matter. Before deciding whether the draft implementing act shall be adopted, amended or withdrawn, the Commission will inform the European Parliament or the Council of the action it intends to take and of its reasons for doing so.
