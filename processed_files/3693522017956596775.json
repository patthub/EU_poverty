        "A PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF E U ROPEAN SOLI DARITY T he people of East Timor have endured great suffering over a long period. The crisis which erupted in September 1999, following the consultative process about the future status of the territory, resulted in many casualties, huge dis- placements of population and wide-scale destruction of property and infrastructures. Today, we cannot say that the problems are over. The recent murder of three UN aid workers, who were helping East Timorese refugees in West Timor, is all-too-tragic evidence of the violent undercurrents which remain on this troubled island. But there are also grounds for hope. Many of the displaced peo- pled have returned to their homes and the UN\u2019s transitional administration (UNTAET) is overseeing the gradual re-estab- lishment of basic services in East Timor, working in collaboration with local leaders and civil society. The European Commission\u2019s commitment to East Timor precedes the events of September 1999. Through its partners, the Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) was already active in provid- ing relief for the East Timorese. We were, therefore, able to move speedily, when the crisis took on a new and frightening dimen- sion, re-orienting our efforts to the immediate and urgent needs of the civilian population. And we have followed up our com- mitment with ongoing support. Refugees are among the most vulnerable people in the world and our assistance to them is a practical expression of the European Union\u2019s solidarity with those who are most in need. I hope that it will be possible, in the near future, to report that the EU Humanitarian Aid Office is no longer funding activities in East Timor \u2013 because this will mean that the humanitarian crisis is over. This does not mean, of course, that the European Commission will be disengaging. The aim must be to link our relief efforts to rehabilitation and then move on to the development phase. We are committed to helping developing countries tackle poverty and integrate into the global economy and are ready to help the people of East Timor in this regard.

ECHO is the European Union\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office, a service of the European Commission under the direct responsibility of Commissioner Poul Nielson. ECHO funds relief to victims of both natural disasters and manmade crises outside the EU. Aid is channelled impartially, straight to victims, regardless of race, religion and political beliefs. ECHO has more than 170 partners \u2013 organisations which have signed a Framework Partnership Contract with the Commission. Its partners are the specialist agencies of the United Nations, the Red Cross family, other international organisations and non- governmental organisations. ECHO is one of the biggest sources of humanitarian aid in the world. In 1999, it provided \u20ac 812 million in funding (not including aid that the EU\u2019s 15 Member States gave separately). ECHO support went to projects in more than 50 countries. The funds are spent on goods and services such as food, clothing, shelter, medical provisions, water supplies, sanitation, emergency repairs and mine-clearing. ECHO also funds disaster prepared- ness projects in regions prone to natural catastrophes. EU Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), 200 rue de la Loi, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium. Tel.

        "ECHO is present from the outset SEPTEMBER 1999 OUTBREAK OF VIOLENT CRISIS SEPTEMBER 1999 OUTBREAK OF VIOLENT CRISIS A t the time of the outbreak of the September post-consultation violence, six international non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) were operating ECHO-funded projects in East Timor worth \u20ac 2 million. Funding was approved in July 1999 as it was then clear that pre-consultation intimidation, violence and uncertainty had become a direct threat to vital services. The initial focus was on pre- serving or restoring essential medical services. However, the operations had to be reoriented following the intense violence, displacement and devastation. In effect, the NGOs were able immediately to put in place emergency assistance providing shelter, medical assistance, non-food items, and protection for internally displaced persons (IDPs). In September 1999, ECHO provided further aid of \u20ac 3 million in the same sectors. Because of the enormous devastation, ECHO made a third financing commitment of \u20ac 10 million in November 1999. The aid has enabled NGOs and UN agencies to carry out programmes in the fields of health and medical assistance, food and non-food aid, logistics, water and sanitation, transport of IDPs, tuberculosis control, rehabilitation and shelter. Additionally, two projects were funded specifically to provide training for local health and medical staff, there- by addressing an area of particularly acute need. By December, \u20ac 15 million had been disbursed to twelve NGOs, three UN Agencies (UNHCR, WFP and UNICEF) and to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) which is involved in the repatriation and resettlement of refugees and IDPs. Of the assistance provided, \u20ac 4.5 million was spent in support of operations protecting refugees, assisting refugees to return home, or direct assistance to East Timorese refugees in West Timor. stop-gap solution. Medium-term strategies for rebuilding local capac- ity are urgently needed. ECHO is collaborating closely with UNTAET and the World Bank to ensure that more sustainable solu- tions are found for the provision of basic health care at district level. Including the \u20ac 8.5 million to be approved towards the end of 2000, ECHO-financing will ensure that medical NGOs can continue to operate at the district level until the middle of 2001. Beyond that date alternative approaches need to be worked out in consultation with the Department of Health Services and the Health Sector component of the World Bank-managed Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET). Under the latest financing of \u20ac 8.5 million, assistance to medical NGOs will be increased and consolidated. \u20ac 3 million is included in this commitment to assist UNHCR in installing the last 8,000 units of its 35,000 unit shelter kit programme. For 2001, ECHO is in discussion with partners with a view to financing rural sanitation and water supply projects. The focus here is likely to be on household and school sanitation, and on ensuring that rural schools have reliable potable water points. During the period 2001-2002, ECHO will be phasing out its financing to East Timor as disbursements under the Trust Fund come on stream and development activities by other donors gain momentum. During this period, however, ECHO will continue responding to requests for humanitarian assistance, should developments and specif- ic circumstances warrant this. EXAMPLES OF ECHO-SUPPORTED ACTION \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022 The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has assisted the transport (over land and by sea) of refugees in West Timor who wished to return to East Timor. \u2022 CESVI (Cooperazione e Sviluppo,Italy), is helping with the rehabilitation of 500 private dwellings destroyed during last year\u2019s unrest. \u2022 Assistencia Medica Internacional (AMI, Portugal) has provided medical assistance in clinics in Dili, Manatuto and Ermera as well as nutritional support, health education, training and capacity building. \u2022 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o para a Coopera\u00e7\u00e3o Intercambio e Cultura (CIC, Portugal) operates a health centre serving 30,000 people and is helping to implement the national tuberculosis programme. \u2022 M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res/Artsen zonder Grenzen (MSF Belgium) is supporting the restoration and rehabilitation of primary and secondary health care in Baucau. \u2022 The Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Aide M\u00e9dicale (CAM, France) is supporting the rehabili- tation of community health services. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Other assistance by the European Commission to East Timor comprises: \u2022 UNTAET: ( \u20ac 10 million). Programme support to the United Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor. These funds were fully dis- bursed by the Commission in May 2000. \u2022 FOOD AID: The World Food Programme (WFP) received \u20ac 8.5 million from the Food Security budget line during a six-month period from November 1999 to April 2000. Through this, some 11,000 tonnes of cereals and 1,300 tons of vegetable oil were made available to East Timor. \u2022 Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET): The Commission has provided \u20ac 19 million for this World Bank-managed trust fund. A further \u20ac 20 million is pledged for 2001, with disbursement anticipated for the second quarter of 2001. The Commission is also providing resources for a liaison officer, a post created in the World Bank\u2019s office in Dili, East Timor. Further development assistance may be considered for 2002. OTHER EUROPEAN COMMISSION ASSISTANCE TO EAST TIMOR MSF dispensary at the temporary refugee camp in the Stadium, Dili ECHO financing will ensure that medical NGOs can continue to operate at the district level until the middle of 2001 \u2018 \u2018 2000 - ECHO\u2019S ONGOING OPERATIONS 2000 - ECHO\u2019S ONGOING OPERATIONS I n March and August of 2000, ECHO committed a further \u20ac 6 mil- lion and in November another \u20ac 8.5 million was earmarked,bringing the total commitment to East Timor, and to East Timorese refugees in West Timor, to \u20ac 29.5 million. In June 2000, donors and humanitarian agencies reviewed the overall situation in East Timor at a donor conference in Lisbon. It was agreed that the emergency period in East Timor had passed. However, rebuilding of houses has progressed much more slowly than anticipated, causing many families to remain in makeshift quarters. It was estimated that between 80,000 and 90,000 dwellings required repairs or rebuilding. By June, resources for only half of that amount had been committed. Repatriation from West Timor had slowed down to a trickle and it came to a complete halt in September when three UNHCR staff were brutally murdered in West Timor. By June it was also clear that the overall level of medical and social services in the districts remained rudimentary and that a lot of work was still needed on essential sanitation and drinking water supplies. In coordination with UNTAET, other donors and partners, ECHO\u2019s resources were increasingly directed to the health sector to ensure a backbone of basic medical care at the district level. Health ser- vices are thus provided essentially by international NGOs and church-related groups, together with medical units attached to the mil- itary contingents of the Peace Keeping Forces. ECHO funds are supporting NGO activities in eight of the 13 districts under overall District Health Plans developed in collaboration with the Interim Health Authority/Department of Health Services. Due to the scarcity of indigenous medical personnel, ECHO\u2019s financing of medical NGOs to provide basic health care is, at best, a P i c t u r e b y P o u l N i e l s o n "
