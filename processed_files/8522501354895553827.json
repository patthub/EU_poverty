        "Tackling Africa\u2019s infrastructure deficit by blending grants and loans. EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 1 The list of eligible African countries and more detailed information on the projects can be found on the EU-AITF website http://www.eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net/. What is the EU-AITF? Created in 2007, the EU-AITF is a trust fund set up by the European Commission and a number of European Union Member States. The EU-AITF\u2019s main objective is to promote investment in infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa 1 through various forms of grants which are blended with long-term investments by selected development finance institutions. In this way, the EU-AITF helps to mobilise additional finance for projects, thereby increasing access to energy, transport, water and communications services. Ultimately, such projects contribute to poverty reduction and help foster sustainable economic growth. EU-AITF funding is available from two different grant envelopes: \u2022 The regional envelope promotes infrastructure projects with a demonstrable regional impact. \u2022 The Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) envelope supports regional, national and local energy projects targeting SE4ALL objectives. What kind of grant support can the EU-AITF provide? \u2022 Technical assistance : for preparatory work, project supervision, targeted capacity building. \u2022 Interest rate subsidies : to lower interest rates and hence reduce the total amount of debt. \u2022 Investment grants : to finance project components or part of the investment, to increase the concessionality of the financing package. \u2022 Financial instruments : guarantee cost financing, equity or quasi-equity investments or participations, risk-sharing instruments. The EU-AITF contributes to the SE4ALL initiative The \u201cSustainable Energy for All\u201d (SE4ALL) initiative was launched by the United Nations to achieve three main objectives by 2030: \u2022 ensure universal access to modern, affordable and sustainable energy services; \u2022 double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and \u2022 double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Since July 2013, the EU-AITF has been supporting the SE4ALL initiative with grants from an envelope of EUR 330m earmarked for energy projects that meet SE4ALL eligibility criteria published by the European Commission.

        "2 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund What types of project can benefit? \u2022 Energy : geothermal, hydropower, solar power and wind power plants, transmis- sion lines, sustainable cooking fuels, etc. \u2022 Transport : road and railway networks, ports, maritime and river routes, air transport, etc. \u2022 Water : water supply, treatment and sani- tation plants, etc. \u2022 Information and communication tech- nologies : submarine internet cables, sat- ellite-based infrastructure, etc. Which projects are eligible? Projects eligible for EU-AITF support must be able to demonstrate both financial sus- tainability and a development impact, including: The total project cost of all projects in their investment phase is currently estimated at EUR 7.4bn Each euro of EU-AITF grant support for projects in their investment phase is expected to generate nearly 15.3 euros of total investment \u2022 a significant contribution to poverty reduction and economic development and trade; \u2022 economic viability; \u2022 provisions for sustainable operation and maintenance; \u2022 African ownership (projects identified as priority projects by the African Union or one of the African regional or national bodies). How is the EU-AITF governed? Three main bodies govern the EU-AITF: 1. The EU-Africa Infrastructure Partner- ship Steering Committee provides stra- tegic advice to the EU-AITF Executive Committee. It is composed of 29 rep- resentatives from the European Union and 29 representatives from the Afri- can Union. 2. The Executive Committee of EU-AITF Donors is the decision-making body of the EU-AITF. As the governing body, it is responsible for all key decisions. 3. The Project Financiers Group brings together development finance institu- tions (the EU-AITF Project Financiers) that have been nominated by the EU- AITF Donors, as well as experts from the European Commission. The European Investment Bank is the Manager of the EU-AITF, responsible for treasury and accounting. The EU-AITF Secretariat is housed at the European Investment Bank\u2019s headquar- ters and provides support to the EU-AITF Executive Committee and \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 the Project Financiers Group for some administrative tasks.

        "3 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund EU-AITF facts, figures and results since launch As at 30 June 2015, the cumulative total of grant operations 2 approved by the EU-AITF stood at EUR 579.3m \u2013 EUR 431.5m under the regional envelope (since 2007) and EUR 147.8m under the SE4ALL envelope (since July 2013). The cost of EU-AITF supported projects in their investment phase is currently estimated at EUR 7.4bn, which is 15.3 times the volume of EU-AITF grant support. How to request EU-AITF support? Identifying projects that may potentially benefit from EU-AITF support is the task of the Project Financiers. As a group, the EU- AITF Financiers review project proposals and prepare grant requests for submission to the Executive Committee. To request EU-AITF support, a project promoter must therefore approach and collaborate with at least one of the EU-AITF Financiers. If EU-AITF Financier(s) co-finance the project If PFG endorses the grant request Public/private or mixed project promoters submit request for project financing to EU-AITF Financier(s) Project Financiers Group (PFG) EU-AITF Financier submits the grant request to PFG for endorsement Executive Committee EU-AITF Financier submits the grant request to the EU-AITF Executive Committee for provisional or final approval \u25a0 East Africa \u25a0 West Africa \u25a0 Southern Africa and Indian Ocean \u25a0 African Continent \u25a0 Central Africa \u25a0 Interest rate subsidies (IRS) \u25a0 Investment grants (IG) \u25a0 Technical assistance (TA) \u25a0 Financial instruments (FI) \u25a0 Energy \u25a0 Transport \u25a0 Water \u25a0 Information and communication technologies (ICT) \u25a0 Multisector 23.4% 45.2% 21.0% 6.0% 4.4% Breakdown by region: Breakdown by type of grant: \u25a0 East Africa \u25a0 West Africa \u25a0 Southern Africa and Indian Ocean \u25a0 African Continent \u25a0 Central Africa \u25a0 Interest rate subsidies (IRS) \u25a0 Investment grants (IG) \u25a0 Technical assistance (TA) \u25a0 Financial instruments (FI) \u25a0 Energy \u25a0 Transport \u25a0 Water \u25a0 Information and communication technologies (ICT) \u25a0 Multisector 35.6% 34.3% 23.2% 6.9% Breakdown by sector: \u25a0 East Africa \u25a0 West Africa \u25a0 Southern Africa and Indian Ocean \u25a0 African Continent \u25a0 Central Africa \u25a0 Interest rate subsidies (IRS) \u25a0 Investment grants (IG) \u25a0 Technical assistance (TA) \u25a0 Financial instruments (FI) \u25a0 Energy \u25a0 Transport \u25a0 Water \u25a0 Information and communication technologies (ICT) \u25a0 Multisector 59.8% 0.2% 28.7% 8.1% 3.2% 2 From 2015 onwards, these figures are presented net of cancellations ",
