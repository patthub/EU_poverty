        "2 The European Investment Bank in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific and the overseas territories The European Investment Bank The European Investment Bank, the bank of the European Union, has been supporting EU develop- ment policies in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions since 1963. In its 50-year history, it has lent nearly EUR 16 billion for some 1 300 projects pro- viding sustainable economic, social and environmen- tal benefits to 92 countries/regional groupings. The EIB carries out its lending in these areas under regional EU cooperation agreements. It plays an active role in international development policy to ensure the alignment of activities with the European Consensus for Development and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Within this frame- work the EIB manages the EU\u2019s repayable aid, which it supplements with its own resources, borrowed on the capital markets. ",

        "4 The European Investment Bank in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific and the overseas territories The private sector as the engine of growth The Bank\u2019s core focus in ACP countries is on helping to generate long-term pri- vate sector-led economic growth and reduce poverty through job creation and improved access to productive resources. The Bank supports public sector projects in revenue-generating infrastructure that is vital to underpinning private sec- tor development and creating a thriving business environment, particularly for SMEs, which are the foundation of devel- oping countries\u2019 economies. EIB funding for private sector initiatives accounts for nearly 70% of the Bank\u2019s total lending in the ACP regions. Since 2003 this money has come from the ACP Investment Facility, a risk-bearing finan- cially self-sustaining facility. What does the EIB finance in the ACPs and overseas territories? EIB financing in the ACP regions covers a broad range of sectors, supporting: \u2022 the broadening and deepening of the local financial sector, including microfi- nance initiatives \u2022 small and medium-sized enterprises through credit lines and equity \u2022 sustainable infrastructure projects in the energy, transport, water and telecommu- nications sectors \u2022 industrial undertakings in areas such as manufacturing and mining \u2022 the expansion of the service sector, includ- ing tourism \u2022 food security \u2013 ensuring access to suffi- cient and safe food and with a top horizontal priority to help countries in the regions adapt to and miti- gate the negative effects of climate change. Who can benefit? \u2022 Private enterprises and commercially- run public sector entities established in an eligible country, with local and/or foreign investors \u2022 Small and medium-sized enterprises in ACP countries, through EIB lines of credit to ACP financial intermediaries and investments in private equity funds \u2022 Cross-border infrastructure projects with regional benefits in sub-Saharan Africa financed by the EIB with the support of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund More than a loan The EIB provides medium to long-term funding through a wide range of financial ",
        "5 The European Investment Bank in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific and the overseas territories Under the Mutual Reliance Initiative, the EIB, AFD and KfW 1 are harmonising their procedures and guidelines to avoid duplication and increase efficiency in supporting pro- jects. A pilot phase of 14 co-financed projects in sub-Saha- ran Africa and the Middle East/North Africa region has just been completed instruments adapted to the nature of each project and to the country\u2019s eco- nomic situation. As a general rule, the Bank finances up to 50% of a project\u2019s costs, thus encouraging the involvement of other financiers as well as other local and foreign investors. Cooperation at strategic and operational level with its European partners, in par- ticular the European Commission and the European External Action Service, is key to maximising the EIB\u2019s contribu- tion to meeting development needs in ACP countries. The EIB also provides grants for technical assistance to improve project identifica- tion, preparation and implementation, transferring the technical and economic expertise gained from its operations across the world to the recipients of its funding. It also seeks innovative ways in which to blend its loan and grant resources to ensure the long-term sustainability of the projects it finances, by helping to build local expertise but also by conferring financial discipline and ownership on its beneficiaries. Instruments In financing projects in the ACP regions, the EIB operates on market-related terms and conditions while offering flexibility via long maturities, grace peri- ods and innovative products. It uses the broad range of financing instruments at its disposal to tailor its funding to best meet the needs of each project. 1 Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau. *Also available under IF Investment Facility (IF) instruments \u2022 Junior or subordinated loans \u2022 Quasi-equity funding \u2022 Equity funding \u2022 Guarantees Local currencies EIB Own Resources instruments* \u2022 Senior loans \u2022 Intermediated loans \u2022 Interest rate subsidies \u2022 Technical assistance Widely traded currencies ",
