        "Social marginalisation has drastic negative consequences for any society. Marginalisation of children has even more dire eff ects \u2013 both for the present and in the future. Stereotypical presumptions about people, coupled with prejudiced views concerning specifi c religions and their followers, are dangerous with respect to the impact that these negative stereotypes can have on progress towards community cohesion and social integration. While many people in the EU have concerns about certain religions and their followers\u2019 possible support for, or engagement in, violence, it is essential that these stereotypes are confronted with evidence looking at the attitudes and experiences of these groups through the lens of social marginalisation and negative stereotyping. This report is about young people \u2013 those from the majority population and those who have identifi ed themselves as Muslims. It sets out to establish facts as to their attitudes on a range of issues and experiences of everyday life in three Member States. The data reported here can be read as proxy indicators that are useful in the development of specifi c policies relating to non-discrimination and social integration of young people in general \u2013 both Muslims and non- Muslims. By researching and analysing experiences of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence in three European Union Member States \u2013 France, Spain and the United Kingdom \u2013 the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights has been able to show that children between the ages of 12 and 18 (young people) who have experienced social marginalisation and discrimination are highly likely to be more disposed to physical or emotional violence in comparison with those not experiencing marginalisation. Moreover, when aspects other than social marginalisation and discrimination have been accounted for, there are no indications that Muslim youth are either more or less likely to resort to violence than non- Muslims. This strongly suggests that social marginalisation and discrimination needs to be addressed, as a priority, with respect to its impact on young people\u2019s support for violence. The research \u2013 even though limited in scope \u2013 shows that the overwhelming majority of Muslim youth have a very similar world view to that of their non-Muslim peers: that is, their concerns include the state of the world and major social issues. At the same time, given their exposure to discrimination, Muslim youth are more sensitive to issues of religious (in)tolerance and cultural identity, which resonate more with their personal experiences. Successful integration between people of diff erent ethnicity or religions hinges upon a clear understanding and application of fundamental rights; such as the right to non-discrimination. Such an approach is crucial in, for example, school policies, through to local and national educational and social strategies. There is also a clear need to ensure that the EU-legislation in place aimed at countering discrimination is implemented in Member States. This includes required mechanisms such as Equality Bodies that must be truly eff ective in addressing the underlying problems. The European Union is stepping up to the challenges of having to embed fundamental rights within programmes and responses to terrorism that both directly and indirectly impact on minority communities in the EU; in particular Muslim communities. The Stockholm Programme and its implementing Action Plan (COM (2010) 171), for instance, set out priorities for the Union in the area of freedom, security and justice; the Plan underscores the need to regard security, justice and fundamental rights as part of the same entity rather than as isolated parts. Moreover, the Plan includes a \u201crobust response\u201d to areas such as discrimination, racism and xenophobia, through deploying all available policy instruments. For the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, looking at the links between social marginalisation and attitudes to violence is essential for development of optimal and well-adapted policy measures at both EU and national level. Stereotypical perceptions, in particular about young members of Muslim communities in the EU, have long lasting and far-reaching negative consequences that should be addressed. It is, therefore, crucial to balance security concerns with concerns about non-discrimination and social integration that are developed within a fundamental rights framework. In sum, preventing marginalisation and violations of fundamental rights is part of the very solution to security problems. Morten Kj\u00e6rum Director Foreword Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",

        "Executive summary 7 Links between social marginalisation, violence and fundamental rights This report presents the fi ndings of a research study conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) during 2008/09 in France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which surveyed 1,000 children between the ages of 12 and 18 (young people) in each of the three Member States \u2013 3,000 took part in the research survey in total. The survey set out to explore possible relationships between young people\u2019s experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation, including experiences of racism, and their attitudes towards and actual engagement in violent behaviours. \u2018Youth\u2019 is often \u2018problematised\u2019 because of some young people\u2019s associations with anti-social behaviour and/or crime. Moreover, there is an on-going negative stereotyping of Muslim communities, and particularly Muslim youth, in many parts of Europe \u2013 in the aftermath of 9/11 (2001), the Madrid and London bombings, and rioting in Paris and other European cities. With this in mind, the Agency undertook to directly ask those between 12-18 years of age about their lives to identify and explain some of the possible diff erences and similarities in their attitudes towards and experiences of violence in relation to discrimination and social marginalisation. In order to explore these themes in the light of contemporary concerns about and potential discrimination against Muslim communities, the research specifi cally looked at young people who identify themselves as Muslim or non-Muslim. The political and policy responses to \u20189/11\u2019 have in many instances across the Union been reduced to oversimplifi cations that can easily lead to stereotypical perspectives; this research seeks to nuance these perspectives. The Stockholm Programme and its implementing Action Plan (COM (2010) 171) off ers an opportunity to appropriately balance security concerns with fundamental rights. The Commission states in its Action Plan that \u201c[a] European area of freedom, security and justice must be an area where all people \u2026 benefi t from the eff ective respect of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\u201d The Commission therefore concludes that \u201c[t]he Union must resist tendencies to treat security, justice and fundamental rights in isolation from one another. They go hand in hand in a coherent approach to meet the challenges of today and the years to come.\u201d The main fi nding of the study suggests a strong relationship between experiences of violence and discrimination; namely those who reported in the questionnaire survey (Appendix II) that they were discriminated against were signifi cantly more likely to have also experienced emotional (this could be teasing, bullying, or the like) and physical violence, both as a victim and as a perpetrator. In addition, those who had experienced these forms of violence were signifi cantly more likely to feel alienated or socially marginalised. This was equally the case for young people from a Muslim and non-Muslim background. This indicates that the experience of discrimination or violence is not necessarily related to religious background. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of results from the research. The rights of the child and child- centred evidence The FRA has a particular interest in examining the perspectives and experiences of children as one of its nine thematic areas of work, for the period 2007-2012, is \u2018the rights of the child, including the protection of children\u2019. In the context of this study, this thematic area cross-cuts with two others; namely: \u2018racism, xenophobia and related intolerance\u2019, and \u2018discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation and against persons belonging to minorities and any combination of these grounds (multiple discrimination)\u2019. This report is based on a survey of 3,000 children (between the ages of 12-18 years) in three diff erent EU Member States: France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Contributing to policies that are variously concerned with integration, violence and terrorism, this research brings fundamental rights aspects, in particular discrimination, into the equation by exploring the relationship between young people\u2019s experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation, and their attitudes towards and actual use of violence. Acts of injustice or exclusion towards Muslim youth, in particular, may cause alienation from wider society, and this may lead some young people to develop sympathy or support for the use of violence. The data reported here can be used as proxy indicators that are useful in the development of specifi c policies relating to non-discrimination and social integration of young people in general \u2013 both Muslims and non-Muslims. The main fi ndings show a strong connection between violence, discrimination and social marginalisation. Executive summary Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 8 Young people\u2019s views and accounts of their experiences are often not incorporated into work that seeks to formulate policy responses and action plans for children and/or ethnic minority groups; particularly in fi elds covered by areas in the Stockholm Programme. The results of the FRA research serves to fi ll a gap in current knowledge about how young people from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds experience their lives, by directly asking them about their opinions and experiences. Building on the need for child-centred research (which is refl ected in the Agency\u2019s on-going work on the rights of the child, see for example Developing indicators for the protection, respect and promotion of the rights of the child in the European Union , p. 15, and in Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child), the fi eldwork was conducted with children in schools in three Member States \u2013 France, Spain and the United Kingdom (England and Scotland) \u2013 and specifi cally in cities with signifi cant Muslim populations. Children between the ages of 12-18 years self-completed a questionnaire. Every eff ort was made to include equal numbers of girls and boys, and, as far as possible, students from both a Muslim and non-Muslim religious background. The subsequent analysis of the results is based on weighted data to correct for any defi ciencies in the age, sex and religious background of the achieved samples. A number of schools took part in the research in each Member State and the sampling approach served to ensure that the results are as representative as possible of the diff erent populations living in the areas surveyed. Children voluntarily took part in the research and were assured that their responses to the questionnaire were anonymous so that no single child could be traced from the survey fi ndings. The results provide valuable fi rst-hand evidence about how children from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds perceive and experience their everyday lives; the results of which off er new insights for policy development and action in the inter-related fi elds of social marginalisation, violence and fundamental rights. Building on existing research on discrimination The FRA, including its predecessor, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), has engaged in research on discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion in relation to several research projects and publications; with a number of reports having focused on Muslim communities in the European Union; these include (all reports available at www.fra. europa.eu under \u2018Publications\u2019): \u2022 Data in Focus 2 : \u2018Muslims\u2019 (2009) \u2022 Community Cohesion at the local level: Addressing the needs of Muslim Communities (2008) \u2022 Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia (2006) \u2022 The impact of 7 July 2005 London bomb attacks on Muslim Communities in the EU (2005) \u2022 Reports on Anti-Islamic reactions within the European Union after the acts of terror against the USA (2002) \u2022 Situation of Islamic Communities in fi ve European Cities \u2013 Examples of local initiatives (2001). A number of other projects by the FRA address racial and religious discrimination more generally, rather than focusing on Muslim communities specifi cally; for example, legal and social research projects that explore the impact of the Racial Equality Directive, as well as community outreach projects targeting children, such as the Agency\u2019s \u2018Diversity Day\u2019 that is aimed at school-aged children in diff erent European cities with messages about diversity and non-discrimination. FRA studies have highlighted the need for more comprehensive and reliable data on the extent and forms of discrimination experienced by Muslims in the European Union. The absence of comprehensive and robust data on Muslim communities presents a major gap for the development of policies that can address the particular discrimination experienced by, and the resultant needs of, Muslim communities. In response to the absence of data on ethnic minority and immigrant groups in most EU Member States, the Agency launched a major EU-wide survey on selected ethnic minorities and immigrants\u2019 experiences of discrimination and criminal victimisation \u2013 the European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS). The EU-MIDIS survey interviewed 23,500 people face-to-face about the extent and nature of their experiences of discrimination in diverse settings; among which 9,500 respondents identifi ed themselves as having a Muslim religious background (all EU-MIDIS reports available at www.fra. europa.eu/eu-midis). The EU-MIDIS results show the extent of discrimination experienced by various groups across Europe \u2013 including experiences of racist discrimination in nine areas of everyday life; experiences of racist criminal victimisation and policing; and rights awareness. One in a series of special Data in Focus Reports from the FRA EU-MIDIS survey ( Data in Focus Report 2 : Muslims) presents the survey\u2019s results with respect to the attitudes and experiences of 9,500 Muslim respondents. For example, the EU-MIDIS survey showed that half of Muslims, but only 20% of non-Muslims, believed that discrimination on the basis of religion or belief was widespread (\u201cvery\u201d or \u201cfairly\u201d). Reference to \u2018Muslim\u2019 youth in this report is proxy for young people with a stated religious affi liation with the Muslim faith. Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Executive summary 9 The results from the three country study reported here could be employed alongside results from the Agency\u2019s other research to inform policy and action at the Community, national and regional level \u2013 and particularly in those three countries where the survey was conducted with respect to policy and action addressing social marginalisation and issues related to integration. However, the general fi ndings are also applicable at a more general level, across national borders and in similar situations. For example, polices aimed at addressing youth violence and radicalisation should consider discrimination and social marginalisation rather than simply focusing on prevention among groups with a particular religious affi liation. Main fi ndings This report presents important fi ndings about the experiences of young people, from both Muslim and non- Muslim backgrounds, that can be used by policy makers to address some of the key issues facing young people in terms of experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation, and how this relates to their attitudes towards and their use of violence. General observations from the research Muslim and non-Muslims share the experiences of \u2018youth\u2019 The main fi ndings of this study centre on the many similarities in experiences among youth, irrespective of religious affi liation. There was no indication that Muslim youths were more likely than non-Muslims to be emotionally or physically violent towards others, once other aspects of discrimination and social marginalisation had been taken into account. Experiences of discrimination or social marginalisation are detrimental factors associated with stronger tendencies towards violence; regardless of religious affi liation or non- affi liation. Consequently, policies aimed at countering threats to society, ranging from terrorism to youth criminality (for example), should also be addressing everyday matters of exclusion and discrimination that can aff ect all young people. Religion and culture are important attributes of Muslim youth identity that need supporting Religious and cultural background are important aspects of young people\u2019s lives, particularly among those whose families have migrated from other countries. Young people are sensitive to cultural and religious diff erences, and individual identity must be understood in the context of such diff erences. Policies aimed at integrating young migrants into the dominant national culture need to be sensitive to these young people\u2019s perception of cultural identity and belonging. Muslim youths have greater levels of concern about tolerance towards cultural identities, both at a personal and a global level, which is likely to impact on their understanding of the way in which such issues are dealt with politically. With this in mind, the results indicated that young Muslims appeared to feel more powerless to participate in legitimate forms of protest or active citizenship than young non-Muslims. Muslim youths experience discrimination diff erently in Member States According to the fi ndings of this study, experience of discrimination and a personal sense of unhappiness or isolation are relatively rare. Nevertheless, young people from certain groups and Member States are at higher risk of having more negative experiences; for example, young Muslim respondents in Spain indicated in the study that they were the most \u2018unfairly picked on\u2019 group, while Muslims in the United Kingdom were the least \u2018unfairly picked on\u2019 Muslim group. Discrimination is experienced by young people on diverse grounds While religious discrimination was higher among Muslim than non-Muslim youths, there were many other reasons why young people felt discriminated against which were symptomatic of widespread intolerance of diff erences between individuals. It could be the case that experience of discrimination, on a range of grounds, may have an impact on subjective feelings of unhappiness and social marginalisation. Most young people \u2013 regardless of religious background \u2013 do not support \u2018mindless\u2019 violence Young people tend not to be supportive of violence that is carried out without a good reason; however, they do justify this in particular circumstances, such as for self-defence or protection of others. Support for global war and/or terrorism is very low, although attention needs to be paid to those young people who have stronger attitudes towards violence, regardless of religious background. Muslim youths are more concerned about issues of tolerance and cultural identity than non-Muslims, which is linked to their experience of discrimination and victimisation on these grounds. Joint conclusion by members of FRA stakeholder meeting, 26-27 January 2010 Young people from ethnically diverse backgrounds experience discrimination on a wide range of grounds, of which religious affi liation is only one.

        "10 Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States Patterns in experience of violence as victims and/or perpetrators vary considerably across Member States and there was no evidence of a Muslim bias in favour of violent behaviour in this study. Members of delinquent groups that have experienced discrimination are at greater risk of supporting violence Analysis revealed that young males and those who are involved in delinquent youth groups are at higher risk of having attitudes that are supportive of violence and of being involved in violent behaviour. This risk is even greater among these individuals when they have experienced some form of discrimination or feel that they are socially marginalised. Attitudes supporting violence do not equate to actual use of violence among youth The relationship between attitudes that are supportive of violence and actual experience of violence is not symmetrical, especially for Muslim youths who display more verbal support than actual engagement in violence (although the French Muslim youths were more violent overall, when asked to report on the extent to which they themselves engaged in emotional or physical violence). However, addressing attitudes that are supportive of violence may go some way towards tackling involvement in both emotional and physical violence. Discrimination and marginalisation are not restricted to Muslim youths, and religious affi liation is less important in determining young people\u2019s involvement in violence than their peer group characteristics and their broader experiences and attitudes. Policy responses have to be adapted to diff erent contexts Diff erent factors are signifi cant in explaining attitudes and behaviours across the three EU Member States. Policy responses have to be adapted to diff erent contexts Diff erent factors are signifi cant in explaining attitudes and behaviours across the three EU Member States. Policy responses to young people who are at risk of social marginalisation and discrimination are best adapted to the local, regional, or national setting. Violence \u2013 experienced as either a victim or a perpetrator \u2013 requires responses that are targeted with respect to the local context; responses that can take into account cultural diversity and local settings. Key research fi ndings \u2022 At least half of all Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in France, Spain and the United Kingdom said they associated themselves with more than one cultural background, which shows the ethnic diversity of the samples. \u2022 French youths do not receive religious education in schools, unlike in Spain and the United Kingdom, and therefore most of their religious teaching comes from home. Muslim youths in Spain also indicated that they learn about religion at home. A greater proportion of United Kingdom Muslims receive teaching from religious leaders than in Spain or France. \u2022 Around one in four young people in each Member State reported they had (ever) been unfairly treated or picked on. Muslim youths were signifi cantly more likely than non-Muslims to say that this had happened to them in France and Spain; although, there was no diff erence between them in the United Kingdom. \u2022 Generally in all Member States, experience of discrimination was signifi cantly related to feelings of happiness and alienation among young people. Respondents who had experienced discrimination were less likely to feel \u2018very happy\u2019 than those who had not. Similarly, mean scores on a scale of social alienation were signifi cantly higher for those who had experienced discrimination. \u2022 Generally in all Member States, young people rarely thought it was justifi able to use violence \u2018just for fun\u2019; however, most felt it was acceptable to use violence either all or some of the time to defend themselves or prevent someone else from being physically hurt. Around one in fi ve thought it was always acceptable for someone to use violence if their religion had been insulted, although Muslim youths in all three Member States were more likely than non-Muslims to agree that this was the case. \u2022 The majority of young people disagreed that using war and, especially, terrorism to solve the world\u2019s problems was justifi able. French respondents were most likely to agree that war or terrorism were justifi ed, while Spanish respondents were least likely; however, the proportion of young people who agreed with these statements was very small, and there were marginal diff erences between Muslims and non-Muslims. Young people \u2013 regardless of religious affi liation \u2013 are concerned about the state of the world and about major social issues, but lack trust in fi gures of authority, especially politicians. \u2013 Joint conclusions by members of FRA stakeholder meeting, 26-27 January 2010 Many young people experience violence (ranging from bullying and other forms of emotional violence to more physical forms of aggression), and there is a strong link between being a victim and an off ender. The main factors that lead to violence are being male, being part of a delinquent youth group / gang, being discriminated against and being socially marginalised \u2013 when these things are taken into consideration, religious background / affi liation plays no part in explaining violent behaviour. \u2013 Joint conclusions by members of FRA stakeholder meeting, 26-27 January 2010 Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Executive summary 11 \u2022 The relationship between victimisation and off ending was strong, for both physical and emotional violence (the latter could be teasing or bullying, for example). For emotional violence, it was far more common for perpetrators to be also victims than it was for victims to be also perpetrators. However, this was not so much the case for physical violence. The fi ndings suggested that the relationship between victimisation and off ending was complex and was not uniform across cultural group or Member State. \u2022 Despite showing little interest in national politics, the majority of respondents did report feeling very or fairly worried about the state of the world today. Concern about global issues was highest in France. Muslims youths in the United Kingdom and, particularly, in Spain were more concerned about the state of the world than non-Muslims; however, there was little diff erence in the level of concern between Muslim and non-Muslim youths in France. \u2022 The global issues that young people reported being most concerned about were poverty, global warming and climate change, as well as racism and confl ict between diff erent cultures. Muslims were more likely than non-Muslims in all three Member States to identify racism as an issue that concerned them; and Muslims in France and the United Kingdom also more readily identifi ed confl ict between diff erent cultures as a concern compared to non-Muslims; although the reverse was true among the Spanish sample. In contrast, non-Muslims in all Member States were more likely than Muslims to express concern about global warming and climate change. \u2022 In the United Kingdom and Spain, while not in France, Muslim respondents were more likely to say that their group of friends was a \u2018gang\u2019 than non- Muslims, but Muslims who did consider themselves to be in a gang were less likely to say that their group accepts, or participates in, illegal activities than non-Muslims who called their group a gang, which may indicate a diff erent understanding of the term \u2018gang\u2019. \u2022 Being more supportive than average in their attitudes towards using violence at an individual level (for example, for self-defence or because they were insulted) was at least partially explained in all three Member States by being male, being part of a group that the individual defi ned as a \u2018gang\u2019 and being involved in illegal activities with that group. \u2022 In all Member States, young people who felt socially marginalised and those who had been a victim of violence because of their cultural or religious background, skin colour or language were more likely to use emotional violence (such as teasing or bullying) towards others. In France and the United Kingdom, young people who had experienced general discrimination were also likely to be emotionally violent towards others. \u2022 In France, Spain and the United Kingdom, the use of emotional and physical violence by young people was strongly related to their likelihood of associating with a delinquent peer group and engaging in illegal activities with that group. \u2022 Emotional violence was as likely to be infl icted by females as males in France and Spain, and being male was only weakly predictive of involvement in emotional violence among the United Kingdom respondents. However, being male was strongly indicative of involvement in physical violence across the three Member States.

        "1. Introduction 13 1. Introduction 1.1. Background to the research Political and policy considerations: youth-centred initiatives There is increasing concern across the EU about intolerance towards Muslims which manifests in various ways as discrimination and social marginalisation, and presents major challenges to integration and community cohesion across Member States. A variety of integrationist policies exist throughout the EU, underpinned by the notion that in order to avoid confl ict \u2013 ethnic, religious and cultural diversity should be integrated within a nation\u2019s common culture and identity. The European Union has emphasised the prevention of violent radicalisation as part of eff orts to combat terrorism. Contributing to that process is a series of reports commissioned by the Commission, on various aspects, including factors contributing to radical violence. 1 The Commission has stated that such factors often originate in \u201ca combination of perceived or real injustice or exclusions.\u201d \u201cNot feeling accepted in society, feeling discriminated against and the resulting unwillingness... to identify with the values of the society in which one is living\u201d are contributing factors. 2 Furthermore, the Commission held that a combination of feelings of exclusion and desires to be part of a group working towards change can lead some young people to get involved in more extreme, or radical, forms of violence. 3 The 2010-2014 plan of the EU for the area of freedom, security and justice (the Stockholm Programme) stresses that fundamental rights must be respected while combating terrorism: \u201cMeasures in the fi ght against terrorism must be undertaken within the framework of full respect for fundamental rights... [and] stigmatising any particular group of people [must be replaced with] intercultural dialogue in order to promote mutual awareness and understanding.\u201d 4 The Stockholm Programme also underscores the importance of prevention. The fi ndings of this FRA report may contribute to this by explaining underlying causes for attitudes towards violence. 5 1 See ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/terrorism/prevention/fsj_terrorism_ prevention_prevent_en.htm (23.07.2010). 2 COM(2005) 313 Final, 21 September 2005, p. 11. 3 COM(2005) 313 Final, 21 September 2005, p. 13. 4 17024/09, 2 December 2009, p. 50 (adopted 10/11 December 2009.

Parallel to policy developments in the area of freedom, security and justice, a number of policy initiatives have been developed for youth that can be considered in relation to fi ndings from this research study. For example, the Council of the European Union has developed a set of aims for European cooperation in the youth fi eld (2010-2018); including: \u2022 The social exclusion and poverty of young people and the transmission of such problems between generations should be prevented and mutual solidarity between society and young people strengthened. Equal opportunities for all should be promoted and all forms of discrimination combated. - Realise the full potential of youth work and youth centres as means of inclusion. - Adopt a cross-sectoral approach when working to improve community cohesion and solidarity and reduce the social exclusion of young people, addressing the inter linkages between e.g. young people\u2019s education and employment and their social inclusion. - Support the development of intercultural awareness and competences for all young people and combat prejudice. - Support information and education activities for young people about their rights. - Address the issues of homelessness, housing and fi nancial exclusion. - Promote access to quality services \u2013 e.g. transport, e-inclusion, health, social services. Promote specifi c support for young families. - Engage young people and youth organisations in the planning, delivery and evaluation of [the] European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010). \u2022 Young people\u2019s participation in and contribution to global processes of policy-making, implementation and follow-up (concerning issues such as climate change, the UN Millennium Development Goals, human rights, etc.) and young people\u2019s cooperation with regions outside of Europe should be supported. Council of the EU, Resolution 15131/09, 6 November 2009 The importance of the participation in community life of young people was also highlighted in the 2001 European Commission White Paper \u2018A new impetus for European Youth\u2019, where it was identifi ed as the fi rst priority theme in the specifi c fi eld of youth.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 14 Acts of injustice or exclusion towards Muslim youths, in particular, may cause alienation from wider society. This may lead some young people to develop sympathy or support for the use of violence. A recently published report on young people\u2019s engagement in radical behaviour shows that: \u201c[w]hen people experience injustice this can easily lead to anger against society, as a result of which intentions to and actually engaging in violent and rude behaviour can occur. This eff ect is particularly likely when people are predisposed to react in strong ways to experiences of personal uncertainty and when they experience that their own group is threatened by other groups .\u201d 6 It is thought that by addressing the root of such problems, more might be done in Europe to prevent alienation and social marginalisation among Muslim youth. 6 K. van den Bos, A.

In general, it has to be noted \u2013 on the basis of some research fi ndings \u2013 that there is no defi nitive link between religiosity and sense of national identity, respect for democratic institutions, or acceptance of violence: A recent Gallup survey about the situation of Muslims in Europe conducted in Berlin, London and Paris indicates that for the majority of Muslims religion is an important part of their daily lives (68% to 88% of the Muslims living in the three cities, compared to 23% to 41% among the overall population in these countries). 7 But this does not imply that Muslims are less likely than the general population to say they identify strongly with their country. For example, in the United Kingdom 57% of Muslim respondents in London vs. 48% of the majority population in the UK indicated that they identify strongly with the UK 8 . Muslims in London also express a high degree of confi dence in the country\u2019s democratic institutions (64%) compared with the overall population (36%). 9 As for the moral acceptability of using violence in the name of a noble cause, a clear majority of Muslims in Berlin, London and Paris (between 77% and 94%) chose a low rating of acceptability on a fi ve-point scale. Yet, the Muslims in Berlin and London are less likely than the general public in the country overall to approve of such violence. 10 Another release published by Gallup in May 2009 confi rms these results. 11 However, aside from research with adults, little is known about young Muslims\u2019 experiences of alienation and social marginalisation, or their attitudes towards and experiences of violence. In addition, it is not known to what extent young Muslims\u2019 views and experiences across a range of social and political issues are diff erent or similar to those of other young people from non-Muslim backgrounds. 7 Nyiri, Z.

        "1. Introduction 15 Studies on radicalisation Several studies related to radicalisation have been carried out recently. The European Commission (Directorate General Justice, Freedom and Security) has commissioned a series of reports: Studies into violent radicalisation: The beliefs, ideologies and narratives (February 2008) 12 , Les facteurs de cr\u00e9ation ou de modifi cation des processus de radicalisation violente, chez les jeunes en particulier (undated) 13 , Study on the best practices in cooperation between authorities and civil society with a view to the prevention and response to violent radicalisation (July 2008) 14 , and Recruitment and Mobilisation for the Islamist Militant Movement in Europe (December 2007) 15 . These reports are based on more in- depth interviews with a small number of persons (around 30) and one of them using an ethnographic methodology. Comparison between these studies and this report is complicated also for other reasons, including location and age (adults) of interviewees. Some of the recommendations made in these studies, however, are pertinent also in the context of this report, such as: engaging and interacting with civil society leadership, including young people; ensure application of anti-discrimination legislation, including strong Equality Bodies; and provide socio- political preventive tools at the local level. Other recent studies of relevance to this report includes, Muslim Communities Perspectives on Radicalisation in Leicester, UK (February 2010) 16 , stressing the absence of causal links between degree of religious practice and violent radicalisation. The report also concludes that focusing on Muslims as terrorist threats and stigmatising religious 12 Studies into violent radicalisation; Lot 2.

FRA research on Muslims: embarking on youth-centred research The FRA, including its predecessor, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), has engaged in research on discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion in relation to several research projects and publications, with a number of reports having focused on Muslim communities in the European Union; namely: Racism, Xenophobia and the Media: Towards respect and understanding of all religions and cultures , that elaborated on the impact media have on these issues; Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia , which includes an analysis of available information and data on discrimination against Muslims in various settings; and Perceptions of Discrimination and Islamophobia: Voices from members of Muslim communities in the European Union , which presents results from qualitative research interviews with selected members of Muslim communities.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 16 These reports underline the absence of research targeting young Muslims\u2019 experiences of integration, victimisation and discrimination; 20 the Agency\u2019s own EU-MIDIS survey sampled respondents aged 16 years and older, and only captured small numbers of young people within its random sampling framework. In particular, these reports note that the absence of evidence about the experience of young Muslims in EU Member States, particularly those with sizeable Muslim populations, is hampering the eff orts of policy makers to develop initiatives to address issues around racism and social marginalisation, and in relation to (the prevention of) violent behaviour. In 2007, therefore, the FRA commissioned research aimed at collecting much needed quantitative data on racism and social marginalisation, to explore the experiences, attitudes and behaviours of Muslim and non-Muslim youths in three EU Member States which had been the target of Islamist inspired violence or violence triggered by experiences of discrimination among immigrants: namely, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. The survey on which this report is based was undertaken by a consortium of three academic institutions experienced in the area of survey research with young people \u2013 including young people from minority backgrounds; these were the Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) (which was the lead university for the project); 21 Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux; 22 and the University of Edinburgh. 23 The fi nal report was written by Susan McVie (University of Edinburgh) and Susan Wiltshire (University of Leeds). The research team in each of the three countries conducted a survey of 1000 children between the ages of 12 and 18 in each Member State, ensuring that the sample equally represented males and females, and Muslim and non-Muslim youths. The research was informed by the following hypothesis: Discrimination and social marginalisation are major stumbling blocks to integration and community cohesion. In particular, discrimination and racial abuse can lead to social marginalisation and alienation that, in turn, might be one set of factors leading some individuals to develop attitudes and even activities supporting the use of violence. 20 See in particular Annual Report 2006 \u2013 Inadequacy of data on racist crime for 2006 and Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia, available at www.fra.europa.eu under \u2018Publications\u2019. 21 Cristina Rechea- Alberola, Gloria Fern\u00e1ndez-Pacheco, Raquel Bartolom\u00e9, Esther Fern\u00e1ndez-Molina, Lourdes Rueda, Ana L.

Aims of the research The overarching aim of the research was to explore the relationship between young people\u2019s experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation and their attitudes towards using violence and engagement in using actual violence towards others. It was not the intention of the research to identify any of the young people participating in the study as potential violent extremists or to suggest that the communities from which young people were sampled were areas that were at most risk of developing such violent activities. Equally, it was not the intention of the research to highlight specifi c problems of violence or social marginalisation solely among young Muslims. This report explores the responses of both Muslim and non-Muslim young people across the three Member States in terms of: \u2022 their socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le; \u2022 their experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation; \u2022 their attitudes towards violence and their experience of emotional and physical violence, both as victims and perpetrators; \u2022 their interest in national politics and global issues, trust in political institutions and potential for active citizenship; and \u2022 their peer group characteristics and leisure activities. This is done in an attempt to better understand young people\u2019s attitudes towards violent behaviour and involvement in violence. 1.2. Context This section presents a summary of literature describing the socio-economic and cultural profi le of Muslim youth, and youth more generally, across the three Member States in order to contextualise the fi ndings presented in the report. Before presenting the fi ndings, it is important to recognise the very diff erent demographic, economic, cultural and historical profi les of the three Member States studied, and the diffi culties in drawing on accurate data detailing both the demographic and socio-cultural characteristics of ethnic and religious minority groups. This report should be read with this caveat in mind.

        "1. Introduction 17 1.2.1. Religion and ethnicity Demographic and statistical information about Muslims in Europe is inconsistently recorded, often relying on unoffi cial data and proxy measures. This is compounded by legalities around such notions as citizenship, ethnicity and religion, particularly in France and to some extent in Spain. Unlike France and Spain, in the United Kingdom it is possible to collect a wealth of general statistics on demographic indicators, including religion and ethnicity, but this is also limited to some extent in terms of the range and scope of their applicability. In 2007, the total population of the United Kingdom stood at around 61 million and it is estimated that Muslims comprise around 3% of the population, though the real fi gure is likely to exceed this in the forthcoming census (2011). Correspondingly, almost 8% of the population, according to self report data, belongs to a minority ethnic group (White, 2002). The Muslim population in the United Kingdom overwhelmingly encompasses followers of Sunni Islam, the majority of these being of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian origin. According to the 2001 United Kingdom Census, the largest religious group, after Christianity in the United Kingdom, are Pakistani Muslims, and there are around 1,600 known mosques across Britain (Masood, 2006). In the United Kingdom, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are generally connoted as specifi c ethnic groups, as sub- categories of Asian or Asian British. The 2001 Census shows that the majority of those who self-identifi ed as Pakistanis and Bangladeshis also claimed to be Muslim: 92% and 92.5% respectively. Therefore, in any discussion about Muslims in Britain and the wider United Kingdom, the focus lies primarily around Pakistanis and Bangladeshis since they comprise the largest groups of Muslims. By contrast, it is not possible to present an accurate picture of the number of Muslims in France or Spain, or to concisely map their ethnic identities. In keeping with the republican ideal that all citizens are equal, a census of Muslims in France remains problematic due to legal barriers, notably the French ban on holding data based on religious or ethnic characteristics of individuals, as illustrated below: \u201cIt is prohibited to collect or process personal data based directly or indirectly on the racial, ethnic characteristics of individuals, their political, philosophical or religious beliefs, their trade unions activities or their health and sexual life.\u201d (Law of the 6 th of January 1978, art.8). The debate on whether to change the law to allow ethnic statistics to be collated continues (see The Economist, March 2009); however, the current population of France is around 58.5 million, and existing estimates suggest that this includes between 3.5 and 5 million Muslims (Laurent and Va\u00efsse, 2005), at least two million of whom have French citizenship 24 . Three quarters of Muslims in France have their origins in North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia), and the remaining 25% come from more than 100 diff erent countries. Their ethnic background is, thus, extremely wide: Maghrebi, Middle Eastern Arabs, Turks, Western and Eastern Africans, people from the Reunion Island, Malagasy, Mauritians, Asians, West Indians, and French converts, as well as people from former Soviet countries. The number of converts to Islam is estimated to be around 80,000; though this fi gure excludes children 24 In its recent report, Mapping the Global Muslim Population , published in October 2009, the PEW Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates that there are around 3.6 million Muslims living in France, corresponding to 6% of the total population. The report is available online at: pewforum. org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf (23.07.2010). Diversity of Muslim communities It is important to stress the diversity of the Muslim communities in the three Member States included in this study. Behind the label \u2018Muslim\u2019 lie individuals belonging to a myriad of ethnicities, each having diff erent cultural heritages and customs, a variety of religious denominations and traditions, speaking diff erent languages and holding diverse political and philosophical views. This diversity of Muslim communities is worth remembering, especially as there has been a tendency to treat Muslims as one uniform and monolithic group. The discourses that dominate media and politics tend to essentialise Islam, attributing it some fi xed, unchangeable and undivided properties. At the same time, the religion \u2013 seen in this stereotypical and simplistic way \u2013 has started to conceal all other possible identities of Muslims, such as ethnicity or class. This is why it is crucial to keep in mind diversity and the rich cultures of European Muslims, when analysing their experiences. One of the other important features that has an impact on the diversity of the Muslim communities in Europe is diff erent migration histories. Factors such as period of migration, reasons for migration, settlement histories, ethnic and religious tensions experienced in relation to migration, as well as war and civil unrest in the country of origin, signifi cantly shape communities and individuals. When talking about Muslim communities in these three Member States, the diff erent context of migration should be taken into consideration. The colonial history of the United Kingdom and France is crucial to understanding the history of migration to these countries and the power relationships between Muslim minorities from the former colonies and the state. In Spain, on the other hand, the centuries-long presence of Muslims and the impact that Islam had on the country\u2019s culture may infl uence the way Muslims feel in the country and are approached today.

Although France is estimated to host the largest number of Muslims in Western Europe, it provides the lowest number of state funded and subsidised mosques in which to worship. However, it should be noted that not all Muslims worship, and among those who do, many do so in community or \u2018garage\u2019 mosques, which makes estimating mosque numbers problematic. Spain has a high number of immigrants, including those who enter illegally. This makes measuring the precise number of Muslims particularly problematic. The only available demographic information in Spain pertains to the nationality of foreigners. The total population of Spain is currently around 47 million, and the 2008 Census recorded 11% of the population as foreign 25 . Most Muslims in Spain originate from Morocco, representing over 70% of the Muslim population, followed by citizens of Algeria, Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Tunisia. Most of the Moroccans and Algerians were men who migrated to Spain in the last 20 years to work in agriculture and construction. There is also a Muslim community originating from the Middle East (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine and Egypt), settling in Spain during the 1970s and 1980s after fl eeing political or religious confl icts in their countries. They generally work in commerce or sanitation industries and many have obtained Spanish nationality by marriage. There is also a third group, which represents 2% of the Muslim community in Spain, who are converted Muslims living in small communities, mainly in Andalusia and Catalonia (Escobar, 2008). 1.2.2. Geographical location Across Europe, Muslims tend to be concentrated in urban areas which results in clustering within particular cities and neighbourhoods. This can be associated with the failure of integration policies, as well as a complex range of socio-economic structural barriers to greater social inclusion. Moreover, migrants across Europe \u2013 including Muslims \u2013 tend to live in poorer quality and overcrowded housing conditions, in poorer neighbourhoods, and have diffi culty accessing housing (CRS Report, 2005). The French Muslim population, for example, overwhelmingly resides in poorer city suburbs where access to housing is cheaper. Data from the Open Society Institute (2007) suggests that the largest Muslim populations are in the following r\u00e9gions (counties): the Paris metropolitan region of \u00cele de-France (where Muslims comprise up to 35% of the population); in south eastern France, in the region of Provence-Alpes- C\u00f4te-d\u2019Azur, PACA (20%); the East of France in the region of Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes (15%) and the north of France in the region 25 In the aforementioned report, the PEW Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates the number of Muslims in Spain to around 650.000, corresponding to around 1% of the total population. See online at: pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/ Muslimpopulation.pdf (23.07.2010). of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (10%). The population in the region of Alsace in north eastern France has been estimated to be lower, at around 5% of Muslims (Reeber, 1996). Spanish Muslim communities are concentrated in the districts of Madrid and Barcelona, as well as other cities and towns, especially in southern Spain. The largest Muslim populations are domiciled in the following regions: Andalusia in the south of Spain, Catalonia in north eastern Spain, Madrid in the centre of Spain, and Valencia in south eastern Spain. There are also Muslim communities in the cities of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Africa, which are under Spanish control (US Department of State, 2007). Muslims in the United Kingdom tend to be similarly concentrated in particular geographical areas, notably large cities across England (in particular in the south, the Midlands and the north of England) and the west of Scotland. Among these cities, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, London and Birmingham feature the worst rates of child poverty in Britain, a fi nding which is not exclusively applicable to Muslim children, but is repeated across every ethnic grouping. The Muslim population of London is around 1 million, speaking around 50 languages between them, representing around 14% of the total population of the City. Indeed, London is home to around 48% of all ethnic minorities in Britain (White, 2002). In Scotland, the Muslim community is far smaller. According to the most recent Scottish Census (2001), most Muslims live in the city of Glasgow, and comprise around 3% of the city\u2019s population. 1.2.3. Age profi le Evidence suggests that across Europe as a whole, the Muslim population tends to be younger than that of the countries in which they have settled. In France, information about the age profi le of Muslims is not available for the reasons stated above. Similarly, the picture is not clear for Spain, but the foreign population in Spain is thought to be younger than the Spanish population as a whole. The largest groups of Muslims come from Morocco, Algeria and Pakistan, with around 15% of these aged under 18 (Institute of National Statistics- INE, 2008). In the United Kingdom as a whole, 33% of Muslims are aged below 15 years (the national average is 20%) and a further 18% are aged 16-24 (the national average is 11%). In Scotland, although Muslims represent a very small group of the population (less than 1%), Islam is the second largest religion and, therefore, boasts the youngest age group of followers, with many younger than sixteen. Indeed, the age structure across all minority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom, and also Europe, evinces a greater volume of younger age groups, which is illustrative of past immigration and fertility patterns (White, 2002).

        "1. Introduction 19 1.2.4. Youth socio-economic indicators Socio-economic factors, such as educational background, employment status and health, for example, may have some bearing on negative feelings concerning State institutions or representatives (such as politicians), and may also infl uence feelings and experiences pertaining to alienation and social marginalisation. Indeed, a disproportionate number of Muslims in Europe suff er from similar indices of poverty and social disadvantage. We focus here on indices of education and employment, as questions on these factors were included in this survey. 1.2.4.1. Education Educational statistics by religion or ethnicity are sparse, though some countries record statistics on the performance of migrants. However, international comparisons of school experience among youth from minority ethnic groups show great diff erences from one educational system to another. Some school systems provide pupils and students with a supportive environment irrespective of ethnic background, while others are far less sensitive to issues associated with ethnicity (Windle, 2008). In the United Kingdom, Indian pupils gain more school qualifi cations than any other ethnic group, while Pakistani and Bangladeshi boys achieve the lowest level. Muslim girls perform slightly better than boys, although not as well as the other groups, except in comparison to \u2018Black\u2019 boys (White, 2002) 26 . There is also low educational attainment among children who are eligible for free school meals in the United Kingdom \u2013 a marker of low family income \u2013 including a large proportion of White children (MORI, 2006/2007). Indeed, diff erences in achievement between 11-year old pupils by eligibility for free school meals are greatest among White pupils, and one third of White British boys eligible for free school meals do not obtain 5 or more Standard Grade qualifi cations. This is a much higher proportion than for any other combination of gender, ethnic group and eligibility for free school meals (New Policy Institute, 2008). 26 The results in White (2002) on pupils\u2019 school qualifi cations are based on data collected using the 1991 UK Census classifi cation of ethnicity, which included nine categories: White, Black Caribbean, Black African, Black Other, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other ethnic group. The 2001 UK Census introduced a more detailed classifi cation of 16 groups: White (sub- categories: British, Irish, Other White), Mixed (sub-categories: White and Black Caribbean, White and Black African, White and Asian, Other Mixed), Asian or Asian British (sub-categories: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Other Asian), Black or Black British (sub-categories: Black Caribbean, Black African, Other Black), Chinese or Other ethnic group (sub-categories: Chinese, Other ethnic group). The 2011 UK Census will again introduce a new classifi cation with 18 categories: White (sub-categories: English/Welsh/Scottish/ Northern Irish/British, Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller, Other White), Mixed/ multiple ethnic groups (sub-categories: White and Black Caribbean, White and Black African, White and Asian, Any other Mixed/multiple ethnic), Asian/Asian British (sub-categories: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other Asian), Black/African/Caribbean/Black British (sub-categories: African, Caribbean, Any other Black/African/Caribbean), Other ethnic group (sub- categories: Arab, Any other ethnic group). Comparative studies show that the French education system is socially selective and that it tends to concentrate the placement of ethnic minority pupils within a few schools (Felouzis et al., 2005). Studies also show that there are much higher levels of pupils with foreign nationality in vocational schools (Payet, 2002). While some research suggests that discrimination is not apparent in overall levels of school achievement, others conclude that education levels are lowest among Muslims (CRS Report, 2005). However, when comparing pupils from low socio-economic background, average academic results at national level are similar for Muslims and non-Muslims. Children from more deprived backgrounds perform less well than others at both primary and secondary school level, although there is some evidence of improvement among Muslims after they make the transition to secondary school. It is possible to construct an approximate picture of educational achievement in Spain. Data are not reported by religion but by country of origin. OECD educational data divides the population into Muslim, non-Muslim and an indeterminate category. These data indicate that at all levels of education, Muslims perform less well than their non-Muslim counterparts. In terms of youth generally, one in four young people leave school with less than upper secondary education \u2013 one of the highest drop-out rates among OECD countries. There are some partial studies about Moroccan pupils which confi rm this tendency. A study by Pereda et al (2004) showed that almost all Moroccan pupils received formal education until the age of 16, with only 2% of Moroccan youths outside of the school system. Nevertheless, participation in education declines for Moroccan youth when they reach the legal school leaving age. This is especially marked among Moroccan girls, whose educational level is 14 points lower than that of Moroccan boys. All three Member States show that pupils who perform less well at school come from poorer socio-economic backgrounds. This includes Muslims but is exclusive to neither ethnic nor religious group. 1.2.4.2. Employment Research literature on the three Member States, as well as in many other nations 27 , indicate that unemployment rates are highest among young people (UNECE Trends, 2005), and that ethnic minorities, including Muslims, tend to be among those minority groups that are disproportionately under-represented in employment. In Spain, for example, the unemployment rate for immigrants at the end of 2007 was 12%, compared to 8% for Spanish workers. During the fi rst quarter of 27 See for example the report on the Situation of Young People in Sweden FOKUS08 , published by the Swedish National Board for Youth Aff airs. www.ungdomsstyrelsen.se//ad2/user_documents/Fokus_08_ENG.pdf (23.07.2010).

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 20 2008, the unemployment rate for migrant workers rose to almost 15%, while the rate for Spanish workers rose only slightly to 9% (Spanish Labour Force Survey, 2007). Muslims in employment tend to work in the lower sectors of the economy, such as the service sector and manual industries. The unemployment rate of youths in Spain was almost 18% in 2006, which is more than 3% above the OECD average. In particular, young Spanish women have one of the highest unemployment rates. The United Kingdom unemployment rate is also highest among young people. In 2008, the rate of unemployment was 15% for 16 to 24 year olds, increasing since 2004, and four times the rate for older workers. In 2004, Muslims aged 16 to 24 had the highest overall unemployment rates. However, regardless of religion and ethnicity, one in eight 16- to 19-year-olds was not in education, employment or training, which is slightly higher than a decade ago. Moreover, the proportion of White 16-year- olds who do not continue in full-time education is higher than that for any ethnic minority group, though many are undertaking some form of training, often as a means of entitlement to state benefi ts (Policy Institute 2008). In 2004, the Muslim population had the highest adult male unemployment rate at 13% and the highest adult female unemployment rate at 18% (Muslims in the European Union, 2006). In terms of ethnicity, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are two and a half times more likely than the White population to be unemployed, and three times more likely to be in low paid employment (Modood and Shiner, 2002). Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are also more likely to live in low income households than any other group in Britain (White, 2002). A third of Muslim households have no adults in employment (more than double the national average); and 73% of Bangladeshi and Pakistani children live in households below the poverty line (defi ned by the state as 60% of median income) which compares with 3% of children in all households (Department for Work and Pensions, 2001). Research evidence from France also suggests that those from minority ethnic groups are more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the population. In 2002, the unemployment rate for immigrants was 16%, which is twice the rate for non-immigrants. Laurence and Va\u00efsse (2007) also found that young people from minority ethnic groups, primarily Maghrebians, were around twice as likely to be unemployed than French nationals. Where those from minority ethnic groups are in employment they occupy the least qualifi ed positions and are over-represented in manual work. Women are concentrated in part-time and less secure types of employment. First generation Muslim women tend to stay at home longer, while the second generation is more likely to be unemployed but on a temporary basis, though their employment rate tends to be impacted by their ethnicity. However, children of immigrants face greater unemployment than the general population: their unemployment rate is 30% as opposed to 20% for young people of French origin (Open Society Institute, 2007). The unemployment gap is not only due to diff erences in social background or education, since even when accounting for this, unemployment rates are still higher for minority ethnic groups. This varies, however, according to country of origin and country of destination (see forthcoming FRA report on Migrants, Minorities and Employment ). Evidence from across the three Member States demonstrates that unemployment rates are higher among youth generally, and ethnic minority groups and immigrants in particular, as well as for women. Employment for these groups tends to be unskilled and insecure, typifying the sometimes exploitative \u2018fl exible\u2019 employment patterns of neo-liberal economies, and likely to worsen in times of recession. Indeed, in most EU Member States, Muslims tend to have low employment rates, which might suggest some element of employment discrimination (EUMC, 2006). 1.3. Research design and methodology There has been much qualitative research in the area of racism and social marginalisation; however, there is a lack of quantitative data in this area. Therefore, the research design for this study involved a survey of 1,000 young people within each Member State, sampling approximately equal numbers of males and females between the ages of 12 and 18 from Muslim and non- Muslim backgrounds \u2013 3,000 interviewees in total. Respondents fi lled out a standardised questionnaire, which was translated from English (which is appended) into French and Spanish. The researchers provided a child appropriate text and instructions for completing the questionnaire; based on their past experience of having successfully undertaken quantitative research work with children in a range of diff erent settings. Questionnaires were fi lled out in classrooms under \u2018exam like\u2019 conditions to ensure that children could not infl uence each other when giving their responses. Children who encountered diffi culties in fi lling out the questionnaire were off ered assistance by one of the members of the research team. It was not possible to conduct a survey using representative sampling techniques, for two main reasons. First, Muslim households make up a relatively low proportion of the population in each of the three Member States, so a representative sample would not have yielded suffi cient numbers of Muslim respondents. Second, there is a strong tendency for Muslim households to live in close geographical clusters, which makes representative sampling problematic. Therefore, within each Member State, specifi c geographical locations which were known to have higher than average populations of Muslim families were selected as the sampling frames. This design was benefi cial in providing a suffi cient sample Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "1. Introduction 21 of Muslim respondents; however, a key disadvantage of the approach is that the research participants cannot be said to be representative of the overall youth population within the three Member States. Diff erent sampling designs were necessary in the three Member States due to the diff erential availability of data on ethnicity which was required to target geographical areas with large numbers of Muslim households. In the United Kingdom, data from the 2001 Census was used to identify administrative areas with high concentrations of households containing dependent children that had a Pakistani or South Asian head of household. However, in Spain and France it was not possible to use census data to identify localities with high levels of minority ethnic groups because the Spanish and French censuses do not collect information on ethnicity. Therefore, sampling strategies in Spain and France relied much more on \u2018local knowledge\u2019 and intelligence gathered from local literature and experts. Within each Member State, two locations were selected in which to administer the surveys: fi rstly, because there was concern that there would not be suffi cient numbers of Muslim youths in any one location to achieve the required number of respondents; and, secondly, the high level of geographical clustering meant that it was desirable to take samples from diff erent locations so as to minimise any skewing of the results by the inclusion of respondents from one \u2018atypical\u2019 location. The locations selected for inclusion were Bordeaux and Paris in France, Madrid and Granada in Spain and Glasgow/Edinburgh and London in the United Kingdom. Further details of the sampling strategy are included in Appendix I. The questionnaire for this study (appended) was developed using questions from a range of existing and verifi ed research instruments, including questionnaires used by the International Self-Report Delinquency Study (Junger-Tas et al, 1998), the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime (Smith and McVie, 2005), the Young People\u2019s Social Attitudes Survey (Staff ord and Thomson 2006), the Eurogang instrument (Weerman et al, 2009), the Gallup Poll of the Muslim World (2006) and the European Social Survey. 28 While these surveys were useful in developing components of the questionnaire, a lack of standardised quantitative measures in this area meant it was necessary to develop many new measures by drawing on broader sources of literature on the topics of youth violence, social marginalisation, political and religious affi liation and youth culture. Nevertheless, questions had to be very carefully drafted in order to avoid contravening ethical guidelines in the EU Member States; particularly in France which has stringent rules prohibiting questions indicative of cultural/ethnic background (see Chapter 1). (details 28 See www.europeansocialsurvey.org for further information on the scope, structure, design and questionnaire for the European Social Survey. about the questionnaire, including piloting and survey administration, are included in Appendix I) The six main themes included in the questionnaire that are covered in this report are: \u2022 Socio-economic, cultural and religious background \u2022 Experience of discrimination and social marginalisation \u2022 Attitudes towards and experience of violence \u2022 Values and active citizenship \u2022 Trust in institutions \u2022 Peer groups and social networks Following appropriate ethical clearance and access negotiations, fi eldwork for this research was carried out in schools, including some colleges and vocational schools, in order to target young people of the relevant age range (see Appendix I, for discussion of ethics and access, fi eldwork and the research challenges encountered). The required sample for the study was 1000 young people in each of the three countries, with equal numbers of males and females between the ages of 12 and 18, from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds, in each Member State. A minimum sample size of 1000 was achieved in all three Member States; however, there was some diff erential bias across the samples in terms of the age, sex and religious profi les of the respondents. These biases were largely unavoidable because of the nature of the research design and the sampling frames used in the research (see Appendix I). After adjusting the data to account for bias, the sample sizes were 952 for France, 1009 for Spain and 1029 for the United Kingdom. Despite over-sampling in areas with large Muslim populations, it was not possible to achieve a high enough number of Muslim respondents to form 50% of the sample in any one Member State. Therefore, the fi nal samples were weighted to refl ect a split of 40% Muslim respondents and 60% non-Muslim respondents in each Member State. It should be noted that the composition of non-Muslim respondents in each of the three Member States varied considerably and these diff erences, while refl ective of the populations within the schools and colleges sampled, may have some impact on the comparability of results across the Member States. The French and Spanish samples over-represented females, whereas the United Kingdom sample over-represented males; therefore, the samples were weighted to refl ect 50% of each sex. The age profi les for the three Member States were also somewhat diff erent, with older respondents being over-represented in the French sample and under-represented in the United Kingdom and Spanish samples. The French sample also under-represented respondents aged 15 or under, whereas the United Kingdom sample over-represented the very youngest respondents (aged 12 or under). Again, the samples were weighted to refl ect equal proportions of 12 to 18 year olds in each Member State. Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",

Data analysis The analyses presented in this report have been carried out using a standard social science statistical package (SPSS). The fi ndings presented in subsequent chapters compare the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents within the three Member States. Where groups are said to be diff erent from each other, or fi ndings are described as being statistically signifi cant, this means that statistical tests ascertained that there was less than 5% probability that the diff erences found between groups occurred simply by chance. Even so, because of the sample size in each Member State, it is possible that fi ndings that appear statistically signifi cant may not be diff erent in an important substantive sense. All analysis presented in this report is based on weighted data, to correct for diff erences in the age, sex and cultural background of the achieved samples and ensure that these refl ect a selected sample of 1000 cases with equal proportions of males and females from age 12 to 18, of whom 40% are from Muslim backgrounds and 60% are from non-Muslim backgrounds, in each Member State. 1.5. Structure of the report This report presents the fi ndings from the research conducted by the Universities of Castilla- la-Mancha, Bordeaux and Edinburgh. Each chapter compares the results from the three Member States with fi ndings presented separately for the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents. Chapter two presents a profi le of the socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le of the young people who participated in this survey. Chapter three explores their experiences of discrimination and their feelings of social marginalisation, while chapter four reviews their attitudes towards and their experiences of violence. The fi fth chapter presents information on the young people\u2019s interest in political issues, their trust in political institutions and their own tendencies towards active citizenship, while chapter six looks at their peer group characteristics and leisure activities. Chapter seven amalgamates the data from the previous chapters and proposes some explanations for young people\u2019s attitudes towards and involvement in violent behaviour. Finally, chapter eight provides some concluding remarks and policy implications that emerge from the fi ndings of the report. Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "2. Socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le 23 2. Socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le 2.1. Introduction The geographical and historical origins of the immigrant populations, both Muslim and non-Muslim, residing in all three Member States vary considerably, which means that the demographic and cultural backgrounds are inevitably very diff erent. Nevertheless, the research evidence suggests some shared characteristics among Muslim groups regardless of country of residence. First, Muslim families tend to be concentrated in particular geographical locations and these areas are often heavily urbanised and characterised by high levels of poverty and deprivation (EUMAP, 2005). Second, Muslims are often over-represented among the youngest members of the population (CRS Report, 2005). Third, Muslim youths tend to be disproportionately aff ected by social exclusion across a wide range of indices, including higher rates of unemployment, poorer health profi les and being placed in the worst social housing (EUMAP, 2005). Data from educational sources across Europe present some evidence of discrimination, with Muslim youths being over-represented in terms of educational subsidies (e. g. free school meals and fi nancial bursaries). However, the fi ndings are more mixed in terms of educational achievement (in France there is only some disadvantage, while evidence from the United Kingdom and Spain suggest that Muslim youths perform less well). All of these factors may have some bearing on feelings of grievance and distrust towards the state and other institutions of authority, as well as contributing to perceptions of alienation and social marginalisation. This chapter is intended to provide contextual background for this report, by providing a description of the socio-economic background, based on parental employment status and entitlement to educational subsidies (refl ecting low income), of those young people surveyed in each of the three Member States. Also included here is a review of the cultural identities of those young people participating in the survey and the nature and strength of their religious beliefs. 2.2. Socio-economic background It was not possible within the scope of this survey to collect detailed information on the socio-economic status of the respondents based on the occupational or educational background of their parents, as there are both practical diffi culties and ethical sensitivities associated with trying to collect accurate information of this type from young people. Therefore, we rely here on a general question about the employment status of the young people\u2019s parents and on information about whether the child was eligible for special educational bursaries or entitlements which are indicative of low income. It is not, of course, possible to infer merely from parents\u2019 employment status what their level of income is. 2.2.1. Parental employment status Young people in the sample were asked whether their father and mother had a job (either full or part time). If they were not living with their father or mother, they were asked to reply about their step-parent or other adult male or female carer, where applicable. The percentage of Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in each Member State who reported that their parents or adult carers were in work is presented in Table 2.1. The rate of employment among fathers or male carers was considerably higher than for mothers and female carers overall; although, the diff erence was more extreme for Muslim youths than for non-Muslim youths. Table 2.1 shows that the mothers and fathers of non- Muslim youths were more likely to be in employment than the parents of Muslim youths; the exception to this was the fathers or male carers of United Kingdom respondents. Less than one in ten young people from non-Muslim backgrounds said that their mother or father did not have a job; while young people from Muslim backgrounds were more likely to say they had a parent without a job, particularly as it related to mothers and female carers. Employment rates among mothers were signifi cantly lower than for fathers for all young people, except the non-Muslims in France and the United Kingdom. However, mothers and female carers of Muslim youths were far more likely to be caring full-time for the family than the mothers of non- Muslim children. This fi nding supports existing literature showing that Pakistani and Bangladeshi women to be least likely to be formally employed in the United Kingdom (Dale et al, 2006). The survey asked young people about issues such as the following: \u2022 In which country they were born \u2022 Religious affi liation \u2022 What language, other than the dominant one in the Member State, is spoken at home \u2022 In which countries their parents were born \u2022 If the parents have a job \u2022 How they would describe their cultural identity Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 24 Looking at the employment situation of both parents together, Figure 2.1 highlights the fact that most young people in this study had at least one working parent or adult carer in their household. However, non-Muslim respondents in all three Member States were more likely to have two working parents than those from Muslim backgrounds. In Spain and the United Kingdom, Muslims were about three times less likely to have two working parents than non-Muslims; although, in France the diff erence was less extreme. Correspondingly, the proportion of Muslim youths who had no parent in the household working is at least twice as high as for non- Muslim respondents. Overall, the fi ndings presented here indicate that the Muslim youths in this study may have been more fi nancially disadvantaged than non-Muslim youths as a result of having parents who were not in employment, although this cannot be defi nitively proved. However, a major contributor to the non-working status of Muslim parents is the traditional caring role that Muslim mothers and female carers adopt within the household, which is far less common for non-Muslim women. 2.2.2. Educational subsidies Forms of educational support can be used as proxy measures \u2013 or indicators \u2013 of socio-economic status, particularly in terms of whether or not children are eligible for some form of fi nancial assistance while at school, and therefore should be kept in mind when comparing results both between groups within a Member State and across Member States. In France and Spain, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are entitled to a bursary to help with their school expenses. The proportion of Spanish respondents who reported receiving an educational bursary was 24% overall, only 1% lower than the national average (Spanish Ministry of Education, 2008), suggesting that the sample as a whole was not more deprived than average. However, bursaries were signifi cantly more common among the Muslim respondents (37%) than those from non-Muslim backgrounds (15%). In France, 40% of respondents reported receiving an educational bursary, which is signifi cantly higher than the national average of 24% (National Ministry for Education, 2007).

        "2. Socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le 25 In addition, the Muslim respondents were signifi cantly more likely (58%) to receive a bursary than the non- Muslim respondents (29%). In the United Kingdom, children from more deprived backgrounds are entitled to receive assistance in the form of free school meals. Among the sample as a whole, 26% stated that they were, or had been while at school, entitled to free school meals. This is also far greater than the national average in both of the United Kingdom sample locations, which stands at 16% in Scotland (Scottish Government 2007) and 21% in England (DCFS 2008). However, yet again, Muslim respondents were signifi cantly more likely (33%) to receive free school meal entitlement than those from non-Muslim backgrounds (21%). These study fi ndings indicate that the French and United Kingdom samples contained a higher than average proportion of disadvantaged young people; although the Spanish sample was fairly representative of Spanish youths as a whole. Taken together with the fi ndings on parental employment, this does suggest that the Muslim youths included in this survey may have been considerably more economically disadvantaged than the non-Muslim respondents. 2.3. Cultural background This section of the report describes the cultural profi le of the respondents involved in the survey, according to their own self-reports. A variety of questions were asked about cultural background, including: the country of birth of the respondent and their birth parents (whether or not they were living with them); what cultural identity the respondent ascribed to and how strongly they associated with this identity; and the use of diff erent spoken languages at home. 2.3.1. Country of origin Most young people said that they were born in their country of residence, although this did vary between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents and across Member States. Figure 2.2 shows that non-Muslim respondents in all three jurisdictions were more likely to have been born in the country of residence than Muslim respondents. The diff erence between groups was most marked among young people in Spain, where more than three quarters of non-Muslims were born in Spain compared to only half of Muslims. Among the Muslim respondents, it was rarely reported that their mother or father was born in the country of residence. Mothers of Muslim youths were slightly more likely to have been born in the country of residence than fathers; however, between eighty and ninety percent of Muslim parents were born in another country. For non-Muslims in France and the United Kingdom, parents were also less likely than their children to have been born in a diff erent country; however, the diff erence was not so marked as for Muslim youths. In Spain, there was no signifi cant diff erence in the proportion of respondents and their parents born outside Spain. These fi ndings strongly indicate that a large proportion of the Muslim youths in each of the Member States were second generation immigrants; whereas, this applied to a far lower proportion of non-Muslim youths in this study. 2.3.2. Cultural identity As there were legal restrictions regarding questions around ethnic belonging and national identity in France, the survey instrument was prohibited from the inclusion of direct questions on these themes. However, since one of the main interests of the survey was to record and measure national and ethnic identity and strength of belonging, the term \u2018cultural background\u2019 was used instead. In measuring this, respondents were off ered a range of country specifi c national identities Figure 2.2: Respondents and their parents born in the country of residence (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Mother Father Respondent Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim France Spain UK Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 26 and ethnicities to choose from, and were permitted to select up to three of these to allow for the importance of hybridised identities (Virdee et al, 2006). In this report, therefore, the concepts \u2018cultural background\u2019 and \u2018cultural identities\u2019 are used, since the survey questions were framed in this way. A list of the most common cultural identities for each Member State was provided and respondents were off ered the opportunity to tick up to three answers allowing scope for multiple cultural expressions of identity. The results of this question are shown in Table 2.2 below. It is important to bear in mind when reviewing these results that the samples for this study were drawn from areas with higher than average concentrations of Muslim households; therefore they are not representative of the population. The responses to this question reveal a multicultural range of respondents in each locality, with many describing themselves as coming from more than one cultural background. Half of all respondents ticked at least two responses in France and the United Kingdom, and a quarter did so in Spain. In each of the three Member States, respondents were most likely to describe themselves as belonging to the dominant cultural group within that Member State e.g. French in France and Spanish in Spain. In the United Kingdom, the research was conducted in two countries (England and Scotland), and respondents variously described themselves as English, Scottish or British. Many respondents described themselves as belonging to a diff erent cultural group; although this varied between Member States. In the French sample, a relatively high proportion of young people described themselves as being Arabic, European (including 1% who said they were Eastern European) or African. In Spain, on the other hand, a third of respondents described themselves as Moroccan with far fewer saying they were European or African, and only a tiny proportion described themselves as Arabic. The most common alternative cultural identity mentioned in the United Kingdom sample was Pakistani, with far fewer describing themselves as African or Indian. The diversity of the samples is further refl ected in the proportion of young people who reported describing their cultural background as \u2018other\u2019, particularly in France and the United Kingdom. These varied widely among respondents, and included Bangladeshi, American, Caribbean, German, Jamaican, Polish, Turkish and many other nationalities. There were considerable diff erences in terms of how Muslim respondents described their cultural background compared to non-Muslim youths in each of the three Member States. Figure 2.3 shows that two thirds of Muslim youths in the United Kingdom identifi ed themselves with the dominant cultural identity (i.e. Scottish, English or British), although only a half of Muslims in Spain said they were Spanish and a mere third of French Muslims described themselves as French. 29 It was signifi cantly more common for non-Muslim respondents to associate themselves with the dominant cultural identity of the Member State; although in France, as shown in Figure 2.3, only half of the non-Muslim respondents described themselves as French which suggests that this sample may have been more culturally diverse from the population than those in Spain and the United Kingdom. A high proportion of French Muslim youths described themselves as Arabic (28%), African (14%) or North African (7%), while in Spain, the majority of Muslim respondents described themselves as Moroccan (71%). In the United Kingdom, one third (30%) of Muslim youths described themselves as Pakistani and a very small proportion (5%) said they were African. 29 In the Gallup survey Muslims in Europe, which was carried out in Paris and London, among other locations, the adult respondents in Paris were as likely to say they identify strongly with France as the majority population interviewed nationwide \u2013 the adult Muslims in London were even more likely to identify with the UK than the majority population in the country.

Strength of cultural identity Respondents were given the opportunity to describe up to three cultural identities that they ascribed to, and for each they were asked how \u2018strongly\u2019 they identifi ed with it. In all, 91% of respondents gave at least one response to this question, while 46% reported on two cultural descriptions and 15% reported on three. It is too complex in the context of this report to describe exactly how strongly respondents identifi ed with each and every cultural group mentioned, because of the sheer variation in answers both within and between Member States. However, Figure 2.4 summarises how strongly respondents in each Member State said they associated themselves with their \u2018principal\u2019 cultural background (i.e. the one they identifi ed with most strongly, not necessarily that of the country in which they were living), without indicating what background this was. To contrast this fi gure with the previous ones, Figure 2.3 showed the extent of identifi cation with the dominant culture of the Member State in question, for example \u2013 French in France. Figure 2.4 captures the strength of identifi cation with the cultural background that they associated with the most, which might have been, for example, Arabic in France (details of the options provided is given in Figure 2.2). The majority of respondents reported that they identifi ed either \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018fairly\u2019 strongly with their principal cultural background, which indicates that young people are aware of and infl uenced by their own cultural identities. The respondents in the United Kingdom identifi ed slightly less strongly with their cultural background than those in France or Spain overall. Figure 2.4 shows that the non-Muslim respondents were slightly more likely to identify with their cultural background \u2018very strongly\u2019 than Muslim youths, particularly in Spain, while there was little diff erence between the groups in France. Muslim respondents in the United Kingdom were far more likely than those in Spain and France to say that they identifi ed \u2018fairly strongly\u2019 with their cultural background. However, only a small proportion from any Member State did not strongly associate with any cultural identity at all.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 28 2.3.4. Other languages spoken at home Another indication of multicultural identity is the use of more than one language; and a fairly sizeable proportion of the samples in each Member State said that they spoke a language other than their native mother tongue at home. Muslim respondents were signifi cantly more likely to report using another language at home than non-Muslims in all three Member States. The diff erence was particularly great in Spain where Muslims (93%) were seven times more likely to speak another language at home than non-Muslims (13%). In the United Kingdom, Muslim youths were over three times more likely to speak another language at home than non-Muslims (89% and 24%, respectively); whereas, the French Muslims were only around 1.5 times more likely to do so than non-Muslims (76% compared with 48%). Concentrating on those who reported that they spoke their mother tongue at home, Figure 2.5 shows that there was considerable variation between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between Member States, in terms of the frequency with which the residence country\u2019s dominant language (i.e. French in France, Spanish in Spain , and English in the United Kingdom) was used. In the United Kingdom, a similar proportion of Muslim and non-Muslim youths spoke the dominant language (English) all or most of the time; but a higher proportion of Muslims spoke the dominant language and another language equally, compared to non-Muslims. In France, the non-Muslims were more likely to use the dominant language (French) all or most of the time; although, a high proportion of Muslims youths also did so. The most extreme diff erence between the samples was in Spain, where the majority of non-Muslims said they spoke the dominant language (Spanish) all or most of the time, while most of the Muslims said they spoke the dominant and another language about equally. 2.3.5. Cultural acceptance 30 The fi ndings so far have indicated some fairly dramatic cultural diff erences between the Muslim and non- Muslim respondents in each Member State. However, diff erence in itself is not problematic if there is a wide degree of cultural acceptance. Young people were asked whether they thought that people who were not indigenous to their particular Member State needed to do more to \u2018fi t in\u2019 to the culture of that country. Figure 2.6 indicates that a large proportion of respondents (ranging from 31% in France to 38% in Spain) stated that they did not know how to answer this question. Muslim respondents in Spain and the United Kingdom were particularly unsure. In France and the United Kingdom, views were very mixed towards this question. However, a fairly substantial proportion of both Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in both jurisdictions thought that non-indigenous people did enough to fi t in with the dominant culture, while a smaller proportion said that they needed to do more. There was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in France and the United Kingdom. The Spanish youths were least likely overall to say that non- indigenous people did enough to fi t into the dominant culture of Spain, and Muslim and non-Muslims did not diff er signifi cantly on that response. However, Muslim respondents were signifi cantly more likely to say that they were not sure about this, whereas the non-Muslims were signifi cantly more likely to say that non-indigenous people needed to do more to fi t into Spanish culture. 30 The \u2018dominant language\u2019 refers to French for France, Spanish for Spain and English for the United Kingdom.

        "2. Socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le 29 Taken as a whole, these fi ndings indicate that there is considerable diversity in the types of cultural identities held, the strength of association with these cultural identities and views about how well people from diff erent cultural backgrounds integrate into society among the young people in this study. Signifi cant diff erences exist between Muslims and non-Muslim youths, both within the three Member States and between them. These cultural identities cannot be said to be representative of the populations as a whole within these jurisdictions; however, they are likely to refl ect historical patterns and trends in immigration and settlement in particular areas of these Member States. A large proportion of both Muslim and non-Muslim respondents to this survey ascribed themselves to identities that were distinct from the dominant cultural group. It is important to bear these cultural distinctions in mind when refl ecting on the fi ndings presented later in this report, as the results can only reliably be said to be applicable to young people living in areas with higher than average concentrations of Muslim households. 2.4. Religious beliefs 2.4.1. Religious affi liation The young people in this survey were asked whether they belonged to a particular religion. Once again, French restrictions on the type of data that can be collected on religious beliefs, limited the range of questions that were able to be included in the survey. In accordance with the research design, the data presented here have been weighted to ensure that 40% of respondents in each of Multiple identities The responses presented in this survey on questions of cultural backgrounds perhaps tell us more about the nature of identity than the actual ethnicity of respondents. Interestingly, many young people described themselves as coming from more than one cultural background, with a quarter of the respondents in Spain and over half in France and the United Kingdom. Cultural identities are not mutually exclusive, but rather compatible and positively correlated. For the young people that participated in this survey, there is nothing extraordinary in feeling that they are, for example, French, Arabic and European at the same time. Such multiple identities should be seen as an enriching factor, as they refl ect the fact that the diversity of today\u2019s Europe can be found not only between diff erent communities and individuals, but also within individuals themselves. This sense of belonging to diff erent backgrounds can also be explained by the fact that many of the respondents are multilingual. Here again, the multiple identities appear as something positive, namely the capacity to communicate in diff erent languages and between cultures. Multiple identities present an alternative to the exclusive identity constructed in contrast to some \u2018other\u2019. They can therefore be seen as an embracing platform on which diverse backgrounds meet and are negotiated. Multiple identities off er young people an opportunity to defi ne themselves in a way that is not limiting and that does not force them into a single ethnic classifi cation that supposedly characterises them as human beings. That is why the recognition of multiple identities is crucial for the inclusion of young people with immigrant background in general and young Muslims in particular.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 30 the three jurisdictions were followers of Islam. 31 Figure 2.7 shows, however, that the non-Muslim respondents had a considerably diff erent profi le in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. A signifi cant proportion of those sampled in France and Spain said they were Roman Catholic (which refl ects the countries respective religious histories), compared to only 5% in the United Kingdom; whereas, 18% of United Kingdom respondents said they were Protestant or another Christian religion, compared to only 10% of youths in France and 3% in Spain. It is important to note that a signifi cant proportion of youths from all Member States, but particularly the United Kingdom, stated that they did not belong to any religion. 2.4.2. Strength of religious beliefs Those respondents who said they belonged to a religion were asked how strong their religious beliefs were. Figure 2.8 31 A description of the data weighting process and the religious beliefs of the unweighted samples is presented in Appendix I (see table I.2) compares the responses to this question for the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in each Member State. The results show that Muslim respondents were signifi cantly more likely to have \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018fairly\u2019 strong religious beliefs compared to those belonging to non-Muslim faiths. Those belonging to other, non-Muslim, faiths were far more likely to say that their religious beliefs were \u2018not very\u2019 strong or that they had no religious beliefs compared to Muslim youths; especially in the Spanish sample. These diff erences in the strength of religious beliefs have obvious implications for issues such as the frequency with which one might worship. Therefore, to refl ect both the nature and strength of religious affi liation, the respondents were divided into three groups: \u2018Muslim believers\u2019 were those who described themselves as having very or fairly strong belief in the Muslim faith; \u2018non-Muslim believers\u2019 were those belonging to other faiths who said they had very or fairly strong beliefs; while \u2018non-believers\u2019 are those who said they did not belong to any religion or they did belong to a religion (Muslim or another faith) but had weak or no religious beliefs.

        "2. Socio-economic, cultural and religious profi le 31 2.4.3. Frequency of worship Strength of religious belief was related to frequency of attendance at a place of worship, and both Muslim and non-Muslim believers were signifi cantly more likely than non-believers to regularly attend a church, mosque or other place of worship. Figure 2.9 shows, however, that there were some diff erences between Member States. In the United Kingdom, the majority of Muslim and non- Muslim believers attended a place of worship at least one day a week (with Muslim believers being most likely to attend on 4 days or more per week). In Spain, Muslim believers were most likely to attend a place of worship at least once weekly; while non-Muslim believers were most likely to attend less than once a week. It was not common for the French youths who were very or fairly strong believers to attend a place of worship at least one day per week, regardless of whether they were Muslim or non-Muslim. Many of the Muslim believers (32% in the United Kingdom and 19% in Spain, although only 8% in France) reported attending a place of worship at least four days per week, although it is important to acknowledge that mosques often represent much more to Muslim communities than a place for religious activity. For example, they are commonly used as after-school clubs, meeting places and off er a range of cultural or language related activities, which may be less commonly the case for other places of worship. Not surprisingly, non-believers in each Member State were less likely than believers to attend a place of worship; although the Spanish non- believers were more likely than those in France and the United Kingdom to say that they did so occasionally. 2.4.4. Religious education It is important to bear in mind that the way in which young people gain their knowledge about religion often refl ects the approach to teaching religion and the status of their religion within the country in question, as well as individual choice. Young people receive information about religion from a range of diff erent sources, and this varies across diff erent cultures and nations. In this study, the young people were asked who taught them most about religion. In France, young people do not receive any religious education in schools; therefore, the most common source of teaching about religion reported by the French youths was family members. In Spain, religious education is taught in schools; however, like the French sample, most stated that they learned about religion from their family. Family members were less commonly a source of religious education in the United Kingdom, with teachers featuring more often than in Spain, perhaps not Strength of religious beliefs The research shows that twice as many Muslim strong believers than other strong believers think that worship or having religion is an important thing in life. When analysing this fi nding, the status of diff erent religions in the studied countries should be taken into consideration. There is a substantial diff erence between following the dominant religion in a particular country and following a minority religion. Even in a secular state, there are numerous vestiges of the previously established religion in public life. One example is that public holidays tend to follow the Church calendar. In such settings, for many of the followers of the dominant religion, religion is so strongly embedded in the way that their society functions, that it ceases to be noticeable. For the followers of minority religions, to be able to practice their religion is much more demanding and often means going against the fl ow. At the same time, religion is a part of cultural identity. For minorities, this means that, for example, worship can be particularly important not so much as a religious act, but as a way of confi rming cultural roots or minority status. This can be important for young people, as they are at a point in life where the search for an identity, as well as for distinctiveness, plays an important role.

Muslim youths in all three Member States were signifi cantly more likely to refer to family members as the most common source of religious education than non-Muslims. In Spain and the United Kingdom, non- Muslims were more likely than Muslims to say that they were taught religion mainly at school. However, a signifi cant minority of non-Muslim respondents in all three jurisdictions reported that nobody taught them religion. Some French and Spanish youths reported being taught religion by their friends, although this was rare in the United Kingdom. It is notable that in the United Kingdom, Muslim youths were twice as likely to be taught about religion by religious leaders compared to non- Muslims; although there was no signifi cant diff erence between groups in France and Spain, where the role of religious leaders was less important in general. This may refl ect the greater availability of mosques in the United Kingdom, which was noted in Chapter 1, and the fact that mosques provide routine after school care which includes a signifi cant religious teaching element. 32 However, parents have the right to withdraw their child from all or part of the religious education curricula.

Key fi ndings \u2022 Based on information about their eligibility for educational bursaries or entitlements, the young people surveyed in France and the United Kingdom appeared to be more economically disadvantaged (based on parental employment and educational subsidies) than the national average, although this did not appear to be the case for the Spanish sample. However, respondents from Muslim backgrounds in all three Member States were signifi cantly more economically disadvantaged than those from non- Muslim backgrounds. \u2022 At least half of all Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in France, Spain and the United Kingdom said they associated themselves with more than one cultural background, which implies the ethnic diversity of the samples. Around two thirds of respondents in each Member State said they identifi ed \u2018very strongly\u2019 with their principal cultural background. Muslim respondents were slightly less likely than non-Muslim respondents to identify \u2018very strongly\u2019 with their principal cultural background, however. \u2022 Many young people were unsure whether non- indigenous people did enough to fi t in with the dominant culture. However, most Muslims and non- Muslims who held a view in France and the United Kingdom felt that non-indigenous people did enough to fi t in. Opinions were more divided among Muslims and non-Muslims in Spain, and Spanish non-Muslims were most likely overall to say that non-indigenous people needed to do more to fi t into Spanish culture. \u2022 In Spain and the United Kingdom, Muslim respondents who had very or fairly strong religious beliefs were France Spain UK Figure 2.9: Frequency of attendance at a place of worship (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Never Less often At least 1 day/week N o n - b e l i e v e r s N o n - M u s l i m b e l i e v e r s M u s l i m b e l i e v e r s N o n - b e l i e v e r s N o n - M u s l i m b e l i e v e r s M u s l i m b e l i e v e r s N o n - b e l i e v e r s N o n - M u s l i m b e l i e v e r s M u s l i m b e l i e v e r s Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",

        "3. Experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation 35 3.1. Introduction The literature on discrimination and marginalisation evidences a range of discrimination indices which show that many Muslims across Europe, regardless of age, are experiencing social marginalization and alienation on a daily basis. This has been exacerbated by various wars in which Muslims are demonised (such the war with Afghanistan and the Iraq war), localised civil discontent (notably the Paris youth riots), as well as large scale terrorist attacks (including 9/11 in New York, the Madrid train bombings and attacks in the United Kingdom in both London and Glasgow), which have all contributed to rising feelings of distrust towards Muslim communities. Hostility and suspicion is further fuelled and supported by the rise of established right-wing racist groups, such as the National Front in France and the British National Party in the United Kingdom. French commentators maintain that contemporary discrimination and prejudice in France is primarily directed towards Muslims (Bastenier, 2004), and Spain has a historical tradition of Islamophobia which has been used to legitimate negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration to Spain (Zapata Barrero, 2006). In the United Kingdom, racism and discriminatory practices were traditionally focused on Black African communities, and the Irish community (on the mainland), arguably until the publication of Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses in 1988, which was highly critical of Islam (Modood, 1992) and elicited condemnation and violent protests from Muslims on a global scale. Thereafter, public fears in the United Kingdom were redirected towards Muslim communities, in particular focusing on the threat of radicalised violence inspired by Islamic militancy. The US inspired global \u2018war on terror\u2019 has increased suspicion and discriminatory attitudes leading to tension, hostility and racist attacks against mosques, Muslim-owned shops, Muslim cemeteries and members of Muslim communities across Europe, and beyond. Discrimination can manifest in a variety of ways and can be motivated by many aspects of individual intolerance, including towards religious beliefs, racial background, language and skin colour, but also less cultural issues such as age, sex and disability. It can be direct and indirect, and can include victimisation and harassment, which can all aff ect people\u2019s welfare and quality of life. Examples include economic and urban segregation, unequal access to resources, racist attitudes in employment and the public sphere, verbal and physical harassment, and generally being picked on or unfairly treated. There is a general lack of literature on experiences of discrimination among young people during their teenage years, particularly in terms of identifying distinctions and similarities between Muslim and non-Muslim youths. This chapter of the report aims to explore young people\u2019s experience of discrimination and social marginalisation, particularly with regards to perceptions of diff erential treatment due to racism or religion. Here we examine the respondents\u2019 reports of being discriminated against in general and, more specifi cally, by adults in the street, in shops and at school or college. We also look at self-reported feelings of happiness and social alienation and the extent to which young people have social support networks. We conclude the chapter by looking broadly at the relationship between experiences of discrimination and feelings of happiness and social marginalisation. Muslim identity and discrimination The results of the study show that there is a strong correlation between experiencing discrimination and the feeling of alienation. This suggests that the negative impact of discrimination and racist attacks on the identity of young Muslims should not be underestimated. As long as discrimination and racism exist, and are tolerated or remain neglected by states, national identities will be exclusive and inaccessible to those who are subjected to racist attacks and unequal treatment. Pejorative stereotypes that are projected on young Muslim people often aff ect their identity. Racism and prejudice experienced by members of Muslim minorities can be critical in infl uencing young people\u2019s ability to consider themselves members of national communities, regardless of citizenship or whether they were born in the country in question. 3. Experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation The survey asked young people about issues such as the following: \u2022 If they are ever picked on for any reason (experiencing discrimination) \u2022 Why they thought they were picked on \u2022 Perceived need to adapt to dominant cultural identity of the Member State (i.e. that of the majority population) \u2022 Size of peer groups \u2013 friends \u2013 and their cultural background \u2022 Social exclusion experienced, contributions to social exclusion of others, and reasons for such exclusions Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 36 3.2. Experience of discrimination 3.2.1. General discrimination In the introduction to the survey, young people were given a very general defi nition of discrimination as being \u2018picked on\u2019 or \u2018unfairly treated\u2019 by others. This \u2018applied\u2019 defi nition of discrimination was used rather than a legal one, given the need to make it as concrete and understandable as possible for the young persons involved. The particular questions had also been piloted and tested with good results that indicated young people\u2019s understanding of the terms in relation to what could be considered discrimination. During the survey, they were asked whether they had experienced such discrimination for any reason, for example, because of where they were from, the language they spoke, the colour of their skin or just for being diff erent. Approximately one in four young people said this had ever happened to them. There was no signifi cant diff erence across the three Member States in terms of the proportion of young people who said that they had been picked on for some reason (24% in France and the United Kingdom; 22% in Spain). However, there were some diff erences in experience of discrimination between Muslims and non- Muslims, and across the three Member States. Figure 3.1 shows that the proportion of Muslim respondents who reported being unfairly picked on was signifi cantly greater than that of non-Muslims in France and, especially, Spain; but there was no signifi cant diff erence between the two groups in the United Kingdom. The reasons for being discriminated against also varied between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents. Table 3.1 shows the reasons young people gave for their experiences of discrimination, separately for Muslim and non-Muslim youths in each Member State. It is evident that discriminatory practices against Muslim respondents in all three locations were centred mainly on issues relating to skin colour, religion, cultural background and language. Nevertheless, a high proportion of non-Muslim respondents also reported being discriminated against on the basis of skin colour, cultural background and, as could be expected, to a lesser extent, language; which refl ects the fact that many non-Muslim respondents in the sample were not from a majority population background too (looking at respondents place of birth, 27% of Muslim respondents in the UK were born in another country compared with 19% of non-Muslims, while the respective percentages in France were 19% and 9%, and in Spain 48% and 21%). The main diff erence between the groups was that religion rarely featured as a reason for discrimination against non-Muslims, but was one of the most commonly cited reasons for discrimination among Muslims, particularly in Spain.

        "3. Experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation 37 Discrimination on the basis of skin colour diff ered across the three Member States. In France, just over a quarter of respondents who said they were discriminated against thought this had occurred because of the colour of their skin, but there was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents. In Spain, only one in ten Muslims said they were picked on because of skin colour, but this applied to two in ten non-Muslims. In the United Kingdom, a similar proportion of non- Muslims to that in Spain were picked on because of skin colour; however, this was perceived to be a reason for discrimination among almost half of Muslims in the United Kingdom. There was no signifi cant diff erence between groups in Spain in terms of the proportion who were picked on because of their cultural background; although, this was higher among Muslims compared to non-Muslims in France and the United Kingdom. Disability, gender and age did not feature as common reasons for discrimination. However, many respondents gave other reasons for being discriminated against, particularly those from non-Muslim backgrounds. There were a wide variety of \u2018other\u2019 reasons; however, these mainly indicated that young people were picked on because they were \u2018diff erent\u2019 to other young people in some way. For example, respondents stated that they were picked on because of their physical appearance, clothing, lifestyle, behaviour or sexuality. Some respondents also noted that they were picked on by individuals who lived in a diff erent part of the city or who were affi liated with a rival group or what they perceived as a \u2018gang\u2019. 3.2.2. Discrimination by adults There is very little literature about the extent to which young people feel discriminated against by adults. Therefore, this survey included three questions about whether the young people had ever been treated unfairly, picked on or treated diff erently to others by adults. Two of these questions were about being unfairly treated or picked on by adults when they were out with their friends (i.e. adult discrimination against youth groups, rather than individual young people). The fi rst involved them walking past adults in the street with their group of friends, while the second involved being unfairly treated by adult staff when they were inside shops with their friends. The third question asked whether the respondents felt they were treated better, the same or worse by adults in their school (or college, for those who had left school) compared to other students. Figure 3.2 compares the percentage of Muslim and non- Muslim respondents from each Member State who said they were discriminated against by adults in the street while out with friends. The key point to highlight is that most young people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, said they never experienced such discrimination; and only a very small proportion of young people said they were discriminated against in this way \u2018much of the time\u2019. Overall, the Spanish youths were least likely to be discriminated against by adults in the street; while the French youths were most likely. There was no diff erence in discrimination experienced between the Muslims and non-Muslims in France; however, there were some diff erences between the two groups in Spain and the United Kingdom. Spanish Muslims were slightly more likely to have been discriminated against by adults in the street than non- Muslims; whereas this was less common among Muslims than non-Muslims in the United Kingdom. The picture that emerged when considering the proportion of Muslim and non-Muslim respondents who were discriminated against by adult shop attendants was practically identical to that of Figure 3.2. Again, the majority of young people said they had never experienced this type of discrimination, and only a small proportion Figure 3.2: How often young people experience discrimination by adults when out with a group of friends in the street (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Never Some of the time Much of the time Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim France Spain UK Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 38 reported that this happened to them \u2018much of the time\u2019. As with adult discrimination in the streets, Muslim youths were more likely than non-Muslims to be discriminated against by adult shop staff in Spain, but less likely in the United Kingdom; whereas, there was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslims and non-Muslims in France. Turning to the question about being treated diff erently by adults at school or college, the overwhelming majority of respondents reported that they were treated the same as other students; although, the overall fi gure was somewhat lower in the United Kingdom (71%) than in France (81%) and Spain (85%). Figure 3.3 compares the percentage of Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in the three Member States who said they were treated better, worse or the same as other students by adults at their school or college. The key point to note is that all of the groups have the same overall pattern, with the vast majority declaring equal treatment by adults at school or college. In fact, there is no signifi cant diff erence in response to this question by the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in the United Kingdom and France. In Spain, however, Muslim respondents were around three times more likely than non- Muslims (17% compared with 5%, respectively) to say they were treated better than others by adults in their school. The proportion of respondents who said they were treated worse than other students by adults in school or college is very small, which suggests that young people are not likely to experience discrimination in this context. This is supported by fi ndings from an additional question on school exclusion, which shows that only around 1 in 10 young people said they had ever been excluded from school, with no diff erences between Muslim and non- Muslim respondents. However, reasons for being treated diff erently by adults in school did appear to vary somewhat between the Muslim and non-Muslim groups. In general, Muslim youths who felt they were treated worse by adults in school or college were more likely to say that this was due to their cultural background, religion or skin colour. Whereas, non-Muslim youths were generally more likely to say they were treated badly for no particular reason that they could identify or because of their behaviour. 3.3. Experience of social marginalisation One of the key areas of interest for this study was to determine how isolated or marginalised young people felt. To do this, three types of question were asked. First, they were asked a general question about how happy they were with their life at that moment in time. Secondly, they were given a short bank of questions from the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (Tellegen, 1982) which has been used in the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime to determine feelings of social alienation (Smith et al., 2001). And thirdly, they were asked about whether they had people in their life that they could share personal or private matters with, to assess the extent of their social networks. 3.3.1. General happiness with life A common method of attaining a general gauge on the level of contentment among young people is to ask how happy they are with their lives as a whole at that moment in time. Figure 3.4 compares the results of this question for the samples across the three Member States. This shows that the vast majority of young people surveyed in our study felt either \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018quite\u2019 happy with their lives at that point in time. Only 15% in each Member State said they were neither happy nor unhappy; while less than one in ten felt either quite or very unhappy. Respondents in France and Spain were more likely than those in the United Kingdom to say they felt \u2018very happy\u2019, although a correspondingly higher proportion in the United Kingdom said they were \u2018quite happy\u2019. There was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in Spain or the United Kingdom in response to this question. In France, the only diff erence between Figure 3.3: Differential treatment by adults in school/college compared to other students (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Worse The same Better Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "3. Experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation 39 the groups was that Muslim respondents were more likely to report being \u2018very happy\u2019 and less likely to be \u2018quite happy\u2019 compared to the non-Muslims. 3.3.2. Feelings of alienation A measure that has been used to tap into feelings of negative emotionality is the alienation scale of the Multidimensionality Personality Questionnaire (Tellegen, 1982). A shortened version of the alienation scale has been used in other research with young people and has been shown to be strongly related to victimisation and anxiety (Smith et al., 2001). This scale consists of six items, each of which tap into a separate aspect of alienation, social isolation and feelings of persecution (see question 8.2 in Appendix II). Respondents are asked to agree or disagree with each item, and given the option of neither agreeing nor disagreeing. By adding the scores from each of these items together and dividing by the highest possible score, a scale is determined which ranges from a score of 0 (representing very low feelings of alienation) to 1 (which indicates that the individual feels quite highly alienated). Overall, the mean scores for this alienation scale were fairly close to 0, which indicates that most of the young people in these samples did not feel highly alienated. Looking at the mean scores for each sample, there was no signifi cant diff erence between the United Kingdom and France (both 0.21), although the average for the Spanish sample was signifi cantly lower (0.15). There was no signifi cant diff erence in average alienation scores between the Muslim and non-Muslim youths in any of the three Member States. 3.3.3. Social support networks Another way of determining whether the respondents felt socially isolated was to ask them whether they had someone they could talk to about personal matters. Few of the young people surveyed said that they had nobody at all that they could talk to about personal matters, especially those in the United Kingdom (5%) and Spain (8%), although this was a little higher in France (13%). The majority of respondents said they had at least one source of support and, in fact, a large proportion (ranging from 59% in France to 65% in the United Kingdom) indicated that they had more than one source of support for discussing personal matters. Non-Muslim respondents were more likely than Muslims in each of the three Member States to report having more than one source of support. Table 3.2 shows that most young people were likely to confi de in a friend, a sibling or a parent if they had personal matters to discuss. Friends were the most common source of support, although non-Muslims Figure 3.4: Rating of happiness with life as a whole (%) 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 UK Spain France Very unhappy Quite unhappy Neither happy nor unhappy Quite happy Very happy Table 3.2: People with whom the youths could discuss personal matters (%) F ra nc e Sp ai n Un ite d K i ngd o m Mu sli m N o n-Mu sli m Mu sli m N o n-Mu sli m Mu sli m N o n-Mu sli m A friend 66 76 50 71 61 70 My brother/sister 36 35 37 33 41 38 My parents/carer 29 47 51 47 58 66 A boy/girlfriend 0 0 8 18 12 19 A religious leader 5 5 3 2 6 5 A teacher 3 5 5 3 12 16 Someone else 7 9 9 7 6 9 Nobody 15 12 12 5 5 5 Note: Columns total more than 100% as more than one response was permitted.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 40 youths in all three Member States were more likely than Muslim respondents to confi de in a friend. Siblings were also mentioned frequently, and there was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslims and non- Muslims in the percentage who said they would discuss personal matters with a sibling in France, Spain or the United Kingdom. Non-Muslim youths were more likely to confi de in a parent or carer than Muslim youths in France and in the United Kingdom, although there was no signifi cant diff erence in Spain. However, non-related adults were rarely reported as someone the respondent could discuss personal matters with. Very few said they would confi de in a teacher or religious leader, and this did not diff er signifi cantly between Muslims and non- Muslims. Muslim respondents in Spain were more likely to say they had nobody to talk to compared to non- Muslims; however, there was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslims and non-Muslims in France or the United Kingdom. 3.4. Discrimination among diff erent religious and cultural groups Analysis was conducted in order to determine whether there were diff erences in experience of discrimination among young people from diff erent religious and cultural backgrounds. The measure of discrimination used here is a composite variable that diff erentiates those who had experienced any of the forms of discrimination described earlier in this Chapter (general discrimination and adult discrimination) from those who said they had not experienced these. Overall, 46% of Spanish youths had experienced at least one form of discrimination, which was signifi cantly lower than for the United Kingdom (61%) and France (60%). In Chapter 2, the respondents to this survey were diff erentiated into three groups on the basis of their religious beliefs: Muslim believers, non-Muslim believers and non-believers (i.e. those young people, either Muslim or non-Muslim, who had no strong religious beliefs). Figure 3.5 shows the percentage of each of these groups who had experienced some form of discrimination, and indicates that the relationship between faith and discrimination diff ers across Member States. In France, around 60% of each group had experienced discrimination and there was no signifi cant diff erence between them. In Spain, experience of discrimination was less common than in France; however, the Muslim believers were signifi cantly more likely than the non-Muslim believers and the non- believers to have experienced discrimination. While in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of discrimination was very similar to that of the French respondents, with the exception of the Muslim believers who were a little less likely to have experienced discrimination than the non-Muslim believers. Respondents were also diff erentiated into immigrant groups in Chapter 2, which distinguished non-immigrants (young people and parents born in the country of residence) from those with immigrant parents (young people born in the country of residence, but at least one parent born elsewhere) and immigrants (young people and parents born outside the country of residence). Looking at the experience of discrimination among these diff erent immigrant groups, it is evident from Figure 3.6 that this also varied widely across Member States. Among the French respondents, the most highly discriminated against group was young people born in France but who had at least one parent born elsewhere. There was little diff erence, however, between the French immigrants (born elsewhere) and the non-immigrants. In Spain, the non-immigrant respondents were signifi cantly less likely to be discriminated against than the young people with immigrant parents or those who were immigrants themselves. There was no signifi cant diff erence in likelihood of discrimination between any of the three groups in the United Kingdom.

        "3. Experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation 41 3.5. Relationship between discrimination and social marginalisation Further analysis was conducted in order to determine whether those young people who had experienced any form of discrimination were more likely than others to feel unhappy or alienated. Even among those who had been discriminated against at least once, the majority of young people felt either very or quite happy with their lives, regardless of religious background or strength of belief in religion. Nevertheless, there was a strong relationship between experience of discrimination and level of happiness, which was very similar across the three Member States. Figure 3.7 shows that those who were discriminated against were signifi cantly less likely to say that they were \u2018very happy\u2019 with their lives (but rather fairly happy), compared to those who had not been discriminated against. Respondents who had been discriminated against were more likely to be ambivalent (neither happy or unhappy) in their response to this question, although a slightly higher proportion said they were either \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 unhappy compared to those who had not experienced discrimination. Still, only 7% of those discriminated against said they were \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 unhappy. Figure 3.8 explores whether this relationship between happiness and experience of discrimination varies according to religious group and immigrant status. This chart shows that those respondents who were discriminated against were consistently less likely to say they felt \u2018very happy\u2019, regardless of their religious affi liation or their immigrant status. However, there were some groups for whom experience of discrimination appeared to have a stronger relationship to feelings of happiness than others. The link between discrimination and feelings of happiness was far stronger among those who were religious believers than those who had no religious beliefs. Both the Muslim and the non-Muslim religious believers were considerably less likely to report being very happy if they had been discriminated against, compared to non- believers; whereas, discrimination appeared to make little diff erence to non-believers ratings of happiness.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 42 Diff erences also emerged according to immigrant status, although the extent of the diff erence was not as great as it was for religious beliefs. Young people who had parents born in another country were the least likely to say they felt \u2018very happy\u2019 if they had been discriminated against, and they were signifi cantly less likely to do so than similar youths who were not discriminated against. Non- immigrants who were discriminated against were also less likely to report feeling very happy than those who did not experience discrimination. However, young people who were not born in the country of residence showed little diff erence in terms of the percentage who felt very happy among those who had and had not experienced discrimination. These fi ndings were broadly similar across the three Member States. Earlier in this Chapter, it was found that there was no signifi cant diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim youths in terms of their mean scores on a scale of social alienation. However, when this scale was re-analysed taking into account young people\u2019s experiences of discrimination and the strength of their religious beliefs 33 and immigrant status, considerable diff erences emerged between the groups of those who have not been discriminated against and those who have experienced discrimination. Figure 3.9 shows that respondents who had experienced discrimination had signifi cantly higher scores on the alienation scale compared to those who had not experienced such discrimination. This was true for both 33 The respondents, irrespective of their religion, were asked to say, whether their religious beliefs are very strong, quite strong, not very strong or if they have no religious beliefs.

        "3. Experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation 43 Muslim and non-Muslim believers, and for those who had no religious beliefs, across all three Member States. It was also true for non-immigrant respondents and those whose parents were immigrants or who were immigrants themselves, although the diff erence within the latter group was less extreme. Again, these general patterns held constant across the three Member States. 3.6. Key fi ndings \u2022 Around one in four young people in each Member State reported they had ever been unfairly treated or picked on (experiences of discrimination). Muslim youths were signifi cantly more likely than non-Muslims to say that this had happened to them in France and Spain; although, there was no diff erence between them in the United Kingdom. \u2022 Less than half of all young people said they were discriminated against at least sometimes by adults in the street or in shops when they were out with friends. Adult discrimination was most common in France and least common in Spain. The experience of Muslim and non-Muslim youths varied across the Member States: compared to non-Muslims, Muslims youths were more likely to be discriminated against by adults in Spain and less likely to be discriminated against in the United Kingdom, while in France there was no diff erence. \u2022 Most young people said they had at least one source of social support if they had personal matters to discuss, and many had more than one. Non-Muslim youths reported having a greater number of sources of support than Muslims, however. Friends, parents and siblings were the most common source of support. French youths were most likely to report having nobody to talk to. \u2022 Experience of discrimination varied according to the nature and strength of religious beliefs in Spain and the United Kingdom, although not among the French respondents. In Spain, Muslim believers were more likely than non-Muslim believers to have experienced discrimination; whereas, in the United Kingdom, the reverse was true. \u2022 Immigrant status was also related to discrimination, although this diff ered across Member States. In France and Spain, those respondents who were born in the country of residence but who had at least one parent born elsewhere were the most likely to be discriminated against. However, there was no signifi cant diff erence in likelihood of discrimination between any of the three immigrant groups in the United Kingdom. \u2022 Experience of discrimination was signifi cantly related to feelings of happiness and alienation among young people. Respondents who had experienced discrimination were less likely to feel \u2018very happy\u2019 than those who had not. Similarly, mean scores on a scale of social alienation were signifi cantly higher for those who had experienced discrimination. Multiple discrimination The fi ndings from this report show that many young Muslims, as well as non-Muslims, experience discrimination on the basis of religion, colour of skin, cultural background and language. Being an immigrant or having immigrant parents also increase their vulnerability to discrimination. In addition, all of these types of discrimination are combined with economic deprivation. This supports the idea of multiple discrimination, where diff erent forms of prejudice are interrelated. Social and cultural categories such as ethnicity, religion, nationality and class interact on multiple levels to appear as inequality. It is necessary to keep in mind this intersection of multiple forms of discrimination in order to properly understand and address Islamophobia and other forms of religious discrimination.

        "4. Attitudes towards and experience of violence 45 4. Attitudes towards and experience of violence 4.1. Introduction This chapter addresses a key concern in current policy discussions and developments in consideration of young people and, in particular, young Muslims in European societies \u2013 namely, attitudes towards and experience of violence (as both perpetrators and victims). While there is no direct link between attitudes supporting violence and actual engagement in violence, the research questionnaire set out to identify any signifi cant patterns within groups and between groups in the three Member States with respect to support for and experience of violence. Looking specifi cally at attitudes supporting violence, the analysis developed a scale indicating the strength of young people\u2019s attitudes that are supportive of violence, which is based on their responses to a set of questions. The results are generally reassuring in that they demonstrate that most young people are not supportive of violence and do not engage in violence \u2013 particular violence that is physical rather than emotional (teasing or threatening behaviour, for example). However, there are some notable diff erences both between and within Muslim and non-Muslim groups in the countries, which requires further research beyond the scope of this report, which is based on results that are specifi c to certain locations and certain groups in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. 4.2. Attitudes towards violence A key aim of this research was to explore young people\u2019s experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation in the context of their attitudes towards and experiences of violence. This section of the report presents the fi ndings on the attitudes towards violence of the young Muslim and non-Muslim respondents, and compares these attitudes across the three participant Member States. Respondents were asked eight specifi c questions in order to assess their attitudes towards violence. The fi rst six were general questions asking whether the respondent thought it was acceptable for someone to use violence in a range of diff erent circumstances. The last two questions were more specifi cally about extreme forms of violence, and asked whether young people agreed or disagreed that it is sometimes justifi ed for people to use war or use terrorism to solve problems in the world. Justifying the use of violence Young people\u2019s acceptance of violence varied depending on what reason someone might have for using violence. For example, the vast majority of young people in this study did not think it was acceptable to use violence \u2018just for fun\u2019, as shown in Figure 4.1. On the other hand, around four out of fi ve young people felt it was acceptable to use violence either all or some of the time in circumstances where they themselves might be physically hurt or to stop someone else being physically hurt. Around one in fi ve The survey asked young people about issues such as the following: \u2022 Exposure to violence from others, and reasons why \u2022 Extent of being violent against others, and reasons why \u2022 Attitude towards using violence against others Figure 4.1: Attitudes towards justifying violence in different circumstances (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 All of the time Some of the time Never To protect their country Someone insulted their religion Just for fun Because someone insulted them To stop someone else being physically hurt To stop themself being physically hurt Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 46 young people thought it was always justifi ed for someone to use violence in circumstances where they had been insulted or when someone had insulted their religion; whereas one in four said it was alright for someone to use violence to protect their country. There were some variations between Member States in terms of young people\u2019s attitudes towards the use of violence. Overall, the French respondents were most likely to support the use of violence \u2018all of the time\u2019 for each of these items. However, there was no diff erence between the three Member States in the proportion of young people who said it was acceptable to use violence \u2018just for fun\u2019. By combining the responses to these six questions, a \u2018scale\u2019 was created which indicated the strength of young people\u2019s attitudes towards violence. In order to make the scale easier to interpret, it was set as having a value between 0 (indicating no support of violence in any circumstances) and 1 (indicating strong support for violence in all circumstances). Overall, the respondents in this survey had a score of 0.28, which indicates that acceptance of violence was reasonably low. Figure 4.2 shows the mean scores for Muslim and non-Muslim respondents across the three Member States. There was no signifi cant diff erence in mean scores between Muslims and non-Muslims in the United Kingdom, although on the individual items Muslim respondents were more likely than non- Muslims to say that it was acceptable for someone to use violence if their religion was insulted. In France and Spain, the Muslim youths had a signifi cantly higher mean score on the attitudes to violence scale than the non-Muslims, with the French Muslims being the most accepting of violence overall. The only circumstance in which Muslims and non-Muslims in France did not diff er was in terms of using violence \u2018just for fun\u2019, which was considered acceptable by only a small minority of respondents. The Spanish Muslims and non-Muslims diff ered signifi cantly on all six questions, with the Muslim respondents being more likely to consider violence acceptable in fi ve of the six questions; although Spanish Muslims were less likely to say it was justifi able to use violence to defend themselves from others. Muslim youths in all three Member States were less likely to say it was justifi able to use violence to stop someone else from being physically hurt. Justifying the use of war and terrorism In order to determine young people\u2019s views about violence in a more global context, they were asked whether they agreed or disagreed that it was sometimes justifi ed for people to use war and terrorism to solve the problems of the world. These are somewhat diffi cult questions for some young people to answer, so they were given the option of saying that they did not know. In the event, only around one in ten young people said they were not sure of how to respond to these questions, and most were able to off er some opinion. In the majority of cases young people said they disagreed that using war (56%) and, especially, terrorism (75%) to solve the world\u2019s problems was justifi ed. However, there were some variations across the three Member States and between the Muslim and non-Muslim participants. Figure 4.3 shows that a very small proportion of both Muslim and non-Muslim youths agreed that war was justifi ed to solve the world\u2019s problems; whereas, most young people disagreed with this statement. The Spanish respondents were the least likely to agree, while young people in France were least likely to disagree. There were no signifi cant diff erences in responses to this question between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in France or the United Kingdom. In Spain, Muslim youths were slightly less likely than non-Muslims to disagree that war was justifi ed; however, this was largely because a larger proportion of Muslim respondents were unsure.

        "4. Attitudes towards and experience of violence 47 The responses to the question on whether terrorism was justifi ed to solve the problems of the world produced very similar results across the three Member States, in the sense that the majority of young people disagreed with this statement, as shown in Figure 4.4. Comparing the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents, those in the United Kingdom showed no signifi cant diff erence in response to this question; although the Muslim respondents in France and Spain were slightly more likely than non-Muslims to agree that terrorism might sometimes be justifi ed. However, it is important to note that this was very much a minority view among Muslim youths overall, with only one in ten French Muslims and one in twenty Spanish Muslims stating that they agreed with this statement. When the results from these two questions were examined alongside the respondents\u2019 attitudes to violence more generally, some interesting fi ndings emerged. Figure 4.5 shows that those who agreed that it was justifi able to use war and terrorism to solve the problems of the world had signifi cantly higher scores on the attitudes to violence scale (composed of six questions, presented in Figure 4.1) than those who disagreed with these statements. In addition, the Muslim respondents in this survey were more likely than non-Muslims to have a higher score on the attitudes to violence scale, regardless of whether they agreed or disagreed that war and terrorism were sometimes justifi ed. However, only the diff erences in the attitudes to violence scores between Muslims and non-Muslims who disagree with the use of terrorism or war are statistically signifi cant, given the overall low number of respondents \u2013 both Muslims and non- Muslims \u2013 who agree with war and terrorism being sometimes justifi ed. These fi ndings indicate that more needs to be understood about the wider experience of young Muslim youths to fi nd out why their attitudes to violence vary from those of non-Muslims. In turn, the explanation of these results may rest with other factors that cannot be isolated to those of religion.

Experience of violence as a victim In order to measure young people\u2019s experiences of violence as victims, they were asked a number of questions about things that had happened to them. These are separated in this Chapter into \u2018emotional violence\u2019, which includes being excluded or left out by a group of friends; being called names, made fun of or teased; and being threatened with violence (see questions 5.1-3, Appendix II), and \u2018physical violence\u2019, which incorporates being hurt on purpose by being hit, kicked or punched; being hurt on purpose with a weapon; and having something stolen from them by force or threats (see questions 5.5-8, Appendix II). Rather than collect information about events that had \u2018ever\u2019 happened, the respondents were asked only to refer to incidents that happened during the last school year (i.e. from September 2007 to September 2008). 4.3.1. Victims of emotional violence The most commonly reported type of emotional violence reported by respondents in each of the three Member States was being called names, made fun of or teased by someone. This was reported to have happened at least once in the last year among half or more of all young people in France and the United Kingdom, although only around a third of those in Spain. Being threatened and left out or excluded by a group of friends was less common, although a signifi cant minority of young people had experienced these forms of emotional violence. Someone threatening to hurt the respondent was most common in France, where just over a third of young people said this had happened in the last year. Overall, experience of emotional violence was least common in Spain. In the majority of cases, young people who had experienced these forms of emotional violence said that this had only happened to them on one or two occasions in the last year, although incidents of name calling were more frequently experienced. By combining the responses to these three questions together, an overall frequency measure of emotional violence was created. This measure showed that 46% of respondents over the whole survey had not experienced any of these Figure 4.5: Mean scores on attitudes to violence scale by whether agree or disagree that war and terrorism are sometimes justified Attitude to war Attitude to terrorism 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 Non-Muslims Muslims Disagree Agree Disagree Agree Figure 4.6: Experience of emotional violence as a victim in the last year (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Threatened Called names/teased Left out by friends Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",

However, a quarter (25%) of respondents had experienced emotional violence between 1 and 4 times, while 21% had done so between 5 and 9 times. Around one in ten (9%) respondents across the whole survey had been victims of emotional violence on ten or more occasions in the last year. There were variations, though, between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents, and across the three Member States. Figure 4.7 illustrates that the Spanish youths were most likely to say they had not experienced emotional violence in the last year, and they were least likely to have experienced 10 or more incidents. There was little diff erence between the French and the United Kingdom samples overall, although the French Muslims were more likely than the United Kingdom Muslims to have experienced 10 or more incidents of emotional violence. Among the Spanish respondents, there was no diff erence in frequency of emotional violence between Muslims and non-Muslims. However, in both France and the United Kingdom, Muslims were more likely than non-Muslims to say they had never been victims of emotional violence in the last year. The biggest diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents was found in the United Kingdom, where non-Muslims were more than twice as likely to have experienced ten or more incidents compared to Muslims. Although the French non-Muslims were more likely than Muslims to have been victims, they were only more likely to have been victims on between 1 and 4 occasions rather then more frequently. 4.3.2. Victims of physical violence This section of the report describes the respondents\u2019 experiences of three diff erent forms of physical victimization: being hurt on purpose by someone hitting, kicking or punching them; being hurt by someone using a weapon; using force or threats to steal or try to steal something from them. The percentage of young people who said they were victims of actual physical violence was much lower than for emotional violence. Overall, only a quarter (25%) of respondents said they were hurt on purpose by someone hitting, kicking or punching them, while fewer than one in ten were hurt by someone using Figure 4.7: Frequency of emotional violence as a victim in the last year (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Never 1 to 4 times 5 to 9 times 10 or more times Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Figure 4.8: Experience of physical violence as a victim in the last year (%) France Spain UK 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 T h e f t b y f o r c e Hurt with a weapon Hit, kick or punch Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",

Figure 4.8 shows that French youths were the most likely to be victims of physical violence overall, predominantly in the form of hitting, kicking and punching. Spanish youths were least likely to be victims of all three types of physical violence. The United Kingdom respondents were more likely than those in the other Member States to have experienced theft by force or threats. As with emotional violence, most young people who had experienced these forms of physical violence said that this had only happened to them on one or two occasions in the last year. When the responses to these three questions were combined, an overall frequency measure of physical violence was created. This measure showed that 70% of respondents over the whole survey had not experienced any of these three types of physical violence as a victim. However, one in fi ve (20%) respondents had experienced physical violence between 1 and 4 times, while 8% had done so between 5 and 9 times and only 2% had been victims on ten or more occasions in the last year. Once again, variations emerged between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents, and across the three Member States. Figure 4.9 clearly shows that the respondents in Spain were by far the most likely to say they had not experienced physical violence in the last year, and in fact none of these respondents had experienced 10 or more incidents. The French respondents were most likely overall to say that they had been victims of physical violence, and the French Muslims were again the most likely group to have been victims on ten or more occasions. There were no signifi cant diff erences between the Muslims and non-Muslims in frequency of physical violence in either Spain or the United Kingdom; however, the French Muslims were victimised on a more frequent basis than the non-Muslims. 4.4. Involvement in acts of violence In addition to measuring young people\u2019s experiences of violent victimisation, two sets of questions were asked about whether they themselves had committed acts of emotional or physical violence against other people. First, they were asked how often they had excluded someone or left them out of their group of friends; called someone names, made fun of or teased them; and threatened someone with violence (see questions 6.1-3, Appendix II). Second, they were asked whether they had hurt someone else on purpose by hitting, kicking or punching them; hurt someone on purpose with a weapon; and used force or threats to steal something from someone (see questions 6.5-8, Appendix II). As with the incidents of victimization, they were asked to only refer to incidents that happened during the last school year (i.e. from September 2007 to September 2008). 4.5. Perpetrators of emotional violence The responses to the questions on perpetrating emotional violence against others produced very similar results to those about being a victim of emotional violence, reported in section 4.2, which suggests a close connection between victimisation and off ending. Within the survey as a whole, 41% of young people said they had called someone names or teased them in the last year, while 20% said they had excluded someone from their group of friends and 22% had threatened to hurt someone. Figure 4.10 shows that name calling and teasing was the most commonly reported type of emotional violence in all three Member States. More than half of French respondents reported doing this to someone in the last year, compared with around two in fi ve United Kingdom respondents and one in four Spanish youths. Excluding a friend from a social group and threatening another person were less commonly reported by respondents in all three jurisdictions Figure 4.9: Frequency of physical violence as a victim in the last year (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Never 1 to 4 times 5 to 9 times 10 or more times Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Note: In Spain, Muslims and non-Muslims have not experienced physical violence as a victim 10 or more times over the last year.

        "4. Attitudes towards and experience of violence 51 although, as with victimisation, a signifi cant minority of young people had perpetrated these forms of emotional violence. Youths in France were most likely to have threatened to hurt another person, while the Spanish respondents were least likely to have committed acts of emotional violence. Most young people said they had only done these things once or twice in the last year, although it was not uncommon for youths to have called their friends names or teased them on fi ve or more occasions. As for victimisation, the responses to these three questions were combined to produce an overall frequency measure of emotional violence. This measure showed that 53% of respondents over the whole survey had not committed any of these three types of emotional violence against someone else. However, just under a quarter (23%) of respondents had done so between 1 and 4 times, and 16% had done so between 5 and 9 times. Less than one in ten (8%) respondents across the whole survey said they had perpetrated an act of emotional violence on ten or more occasions in the last year. Figure 4.11 illustrates the extent of variation in responses between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents, across the three Member States. Overall, there was no signifi cant diff erence in the frequency of committing acts of emotional violence against others between the Muslim and the non-Muslim respondents in France or the United Kingdom. It is clear from Figure 4.11, however, that the French respondents were more likely to have committed such acts with greater frequency than in the United Kingdom. The Spanish youths were least likely to have committed acts of emotional violence overall; however, the non-Muslims were slightly more likely to have done so than the Muslim respondents, albeit only in the 1 to 4 times category. 4.6. Perpetrators of physical violence Finally, the respondent\u2019s were asked whether they had committed any of the following acts of physical victimization: hurting someone on purpose by hitting, kicking or punching them; hurting someone by using Figure 4.10: Experience of emotional violence as a perpetrator (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Threatened somebody Teased/called somebody names Left out a friend F i gu re 4 . 11 : F re qu e n c y o f emotio n al viole n ce as a p er p etrator (%) F ra n ce Sp ai n UK 0 1 0 20 30 4 0 50 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 00 N e v er 1 to 4 times 5 to 9 times 1 0 or more times N on -Mu s l im Mu s l im N on -Mu s l im Mu s l im N on -Mu s l im Mu s l im Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",

As was the case with experience of victimisation, the percentage of young people who said they had committed acts of physical violence was far lower than for emotional violence. Overall, 27% of respondents said they had hurt someone on purpose by someone hitting, kicking or punching them, while a very small percentage had hurt someone using a weapon (7%) or used force or threats to steal or try to steal something from someone (4%). As well as being the most likely to be victims of physical violence, the French respondents were most likely to say they had hit, kicked or punched someone else in the last year. Figure 4.12 shows that prevalence of this type of violence was around twice as high as for the United Kingdom respondents, and around four times as high as the young people in Spain. Other forms of physical violence were rare in all three Member States, although the Spanish youths were least likely to have been physically violent overall. Among those who had committed acts of physical violence against others, few people tended to do so more than once or twice, although a very small minority were more frequent off enders. Looking at the frequency of physical violence committed across the three types of act, 70% said they had not committed even one act in the last year, which is very similar to the proportion that said they had not been victims (72%). Overall, 17% of young people said they had committed between 1 and 4 acts of physical violence, while 9% had committed between 5 and 9 acts and only 2% had been off enders on 10 or more occasions. Again, these percentages are very similar to those for victims of physical violence (20%, 8% and 2%, respectively). Figure 4.13 confi rms that the Spanish respondents were the least likely to physically victimise someone, while the French were the most likely. There was no signifi cant diff erence in the frequency of physical violence between Muslims and non-Muslims in the United Kingdom; Muslims in both France and Spain reported being physically violent towards others more frequently than did the non-Muslims. However, it should be noted that fewer than one in ten Muslims in France, and only one percent in Spain, said they had committed 10 or more acts of physical violence in the last year.

        "4. Attitudes towards and experience of violence 53 4.7. Reasons for involvement in emotional and physical violence Those young people who reported that they had experienced any form of emotional or physical violence, either as a victim or as a perpetrator, were asked to think carefully about why these things had happened (see questions 5.4, 5.8, 6.4 and 6.8, Appendix II). A predefi ned list of possible reasons was presented (which included culture, gender, religion, skin colour language, age and disability), but they were also encouraged to add additional reasons if the given list did not apply. Interestingly, the pattern of responses given for victims and perpetrators of emotional violence was almost identical, similar to the pattern between victims and perpetrators of physical violence. For this reason, only the patterns of response for the victims and perpetrators of physical violence are illustrated in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Most of the young people who had been victims of emotional or physical violence gave some reason other than that in the predefi ned list of options; however, it is clear from Figure 4.14 that Muslim respondents were more likely than non-Muslims to state that they were victimised for reasons of cultural background, religion, language and skin colour. Muslims were also more likely to say they were victimised because of their age, gender and disability; however, the diff erence between Muslims and non-Muslims on these measures was not nearly so great. Of the \u2018other\u2019 reasons that were mentioned for being victims, these tended to relate to the individual\u2019s appearance. For example, many young people said that they had been victims of both emotional and physical violence because of their weight, height, hair colour, skin complexion or clothes. However, some victims of emotional violence also stated that they felt it was a joke, \u2018a laugh\u2019 or not really serious. In contrast, fewer victims of physical violence thought that they had been victimised for \u2018a laugh\u2019; however, many stated that the other person was a friend who had turned against them, a bully, or someone who often picked fi ghts with people. In a substantial number of cases, the physical violence was said to be a result of a fi ght involving a larger group of people, and it was not uncommon for young people to say that alcohol had been the cause of the fi ght.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 54 The responses from the perpetrators of emotional and physical violence contrasted starkly with those of the victims, as shown in Figure 4.15. It is clear that young people who were perpetrators were far less likely to give the reasons included in the pre-defi ned list, and that a great many other reasons were behind their involvement in these forms of violence. Nevertheless, Muslim respondents were more likely than the non-Muslims to say that they had perpetrated acts of emotional or physical violence against others because of the other person\u2019s personal characteristics such as disability, age, language, gender etc. (Figure 4.15). Also, Muslim victims of physical violence tended to identify their personal characteristics far more often than non-Muslim victims as being reasons for victimisation (Figure 4.14). The most common reasons given by perpetrators of emotional violence were that it was a joke or \u2018a laugh\u2019, that the other person was annoying or provoking, that they themselves had been called names, teased or threatened fi rst and that it was just a silly argument that had escalated. Perpetrators of physical violence tended to give similar reasons, although it was more common for them to say that they had hit the other person as some form of retribution, because the other person had provoked it by annoying them and calling them names, or in self-defence because the other person had started the fi ght. 4.8. Relationship between violent off ending and victimisation Other research has shown a strong relationship between victimisation and off ending (see Smith and Ecob 2007), and there is evidence from this study that those who had been perpetrators of emotional or physical violence were also likely to report that they had been victims. No causal assumptions can be made about this relationship; however, by asking the questions on victimisation fi rst it was anticipated that off enders would be less likely to report their victimisation as a means of mitigating their own behaviour. Figure 4.16 shows that the two forms of behaviour were strongly related among both the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in each of the three Member States. Overall, the relationship between victimisation and off ending for emotional violence was stronger among the French and the United Kingdom respondents than among the young people in the Spanish sample. Figure 4.16 shows a reasonably clear pattern in the data, which suggests that it was more common for perpetrators of emotional violence to be also victims than it was for victims to be also perpetrators \u2013 bearing in mind that the two groups may constitute diff erent respondents in the survey. This was true of Muslim and non-Muslim youths in the United Kingdom and Spain, although only true of non-Muslim youths in France. The French Muslims who had been victims of emotional violence were more likely to be perpetrators than the perpetrators were to be victims. Interestingly, however, the pattern was not quite so clear cut for physical violence. Figure 4.17 shows, once again, that the relationship between victimisation and off ending for physical violence was stronger in France and the United Kingdom than it was for Spain. Although the pattern among the United Kingdom sample was similar, in that the perpetrators were more likely to be victims than the victims were to be perpetrators; there was no signifi cant diff erence between these two groups among the French Muslims and non-Muslims. Moreover, the Spanish Muslim respondents showed a distinctly diff erent relationship between victimisation and off ending to the non-Muslims. These fi ndings indicate that the relationship between victimisation and off ending is extremely complex and is uniform neither across cultural groups nor Member States.

        "4. Attitudes towards and experience of violence 55 4.9. Key fi ndings \u2022 Young people rarely thought it was justifi able to use violence \u2018just for fun\u2019; however, most felt it was acceptable to use violence either all or some of the time to defend themselves or prevent someone else from being physically hurt. Around one in fi ve thought it was always acceptable for someone to use violence if their religion had been insulted, although Muslim youths in all three Member States were more likely than non-Muslims to agree that this was the case. \u2022 Looking at an overall attitudes score, the level of support for violence was low in all three Member States, although young people in France were more likely than those in Spain and the United Kingdom to have more positive attitudes towards the use of violence. There was no diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim youths in their general level of support for the use of violence among United Kingdom respondents; although Muslim youths in France and Spain displayed a higher level of support for violence. \u2022 The majority of young people disagreed that using war and, especially, terrorism to solve the world\u2019s problems was justifi able. French respondents were most likely to agree that war or terrorism were justifi ed, while Spanish respondents were least likely; however, the proportion of young people who agreed with these statements was very small, and there were marginal diff erences between Muslims and non-Muslims. \u2022 Those who agreed that it was justifi able to use war and terrorism to solve the problems of the world had signifi cantly higher scores on the attitudes to violence scale than those who disagreed with these statements. Muslim respondents were more likely than non-Muslims to have a higher score on the attitudes to violence scale, regardless of whether they agreed or disagreed that war and terrorism were sometimes justifi ed. \u2022 Overall, there was no signifi cant diff erence in the frequency of committing acts of emotional violence against others between the Muslim and the non-Muslim respondents in France or the United Kingdom. The Spanish youths were least likely to have committed acts of emotional violence overall; however, the non-Muslims were slightly more likely to have done so than the Muslim respondents. \u2022 The relationship between victimisation and off ending was strong, for both physical and emotional violence. For emotional violence, it was far more common for perpetrators to be also victims than it was for victims to be also perpetrators. However, this was not so much the case for physical violence, and the fi ndings suggested that the relationship between victimisation and off ending was complex and was not uniform across cultural group or Member State.

        "5. Political interest, trust and citizenship 57 5. Political interest, trust and citizenship 5.1. Introduction This chapter of the report explores the interest in and attitudes of young people towards political issues and institutions and their potential likelihood of involvement in local political issues. The literature on political interest among young people emphasises both their political apathy and a sense of political alienation. Recent research in the United Kingdom, for example, suggests that whilst young people support the idea of democratic processes, they are cynical about the structure and conduct of the British political system, and are at best indiff erent towards politicians and political parties (Park, 2000; Kimberlee, 2002; Henn et al, 2005; Hopkins, 2007). In France, data also suggests that young people have little trust in political parties and that around two thirds distrust politicians (Paakkunainen et al, 2005). A similar picture is evident in Spain, where youths have reported feel uninformed about politics (Vidal, Valls and Creixam, 2006). A recent European survey has indicated that more should be done to take account of young people\u2019s needs and interests, as well as their ideas and contributions, as an incentive to encourage greater participation in institutional systems of democracy (Analysis of Member States\u2019 Replies, 2003). There is evidence that young people\u2019s views diff er according to their social class, educational history and gender; although interestingly Henn et al (2005) found that both ethnicity and region of the country in which young people live had little infl uence in structuring political attitudes and behaviour. This chapter examines young people\u2019s level of interest in politics at the national level, and contrasts this with their opinions of and attitudes towards a range of global social issues. The chapter also explores young people\u2019s level of trust in a variety of \u2018formal\u2019 individuals and institutions, including political leaders, and compares this with their level of trust in more proximal contacts such as parents and friends. Finally, it explores the notion of active citizenship and examines the types of action which young people indicate that they would take in response to a political issue that directly aff ected them in their local neighbourhood. 5.2. Interest in national politics Respondents in this study were asked how interested they were in what was going on in politics in their country of residence. Figure 5.1 shows that interest in national politics among respondents was fairly low, with only ten percent or less of respondents in each Member State indicating that they were \u2018very interested\u2019 in national politics. At least half of the young people in each Member state reported that they were not interested in politics in their country. Overall, respondents in Spain were more likely than those in France or the United Kingdom to say that they were not The survey asked young people about issues such as the following: \u2022 Concerns about the state of the world \u2022 Trust in politicians and institutions \u2022 Interest in politics \u2022 Willingness to take civic action \u2022 Membership of various organisations Figure 5.1: Level of interest in national politics (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Not interested Quite interested Very interested Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 58 interested in politics; although, there was no signifi cant diff erence between France and the United Kingdom on this measure. Muslims youths in the United Kingdom and Spain were slightly more likely than non-Muslims to say that they were interested in politics; however, the diff erence between Muslims and non-Muslims was not very great in any of the three Member States. 5.3. Concern about global social problems Despite their stated lack of interest in national politics, the majority of respondents reported feeling \u2018very worried\u2019 or \u2018quite worried\u2019 about the state of the world today. The proportion of young people who reported being \u2018very worried\u2019 was highest in France (29%) and lower in Spain (24%) and the United Kingdom (21%). Overall, the pattern of results was similar across the three Member States, as shown in Figure 5.2, although there was some variation in terms of the diff erences between Muslim and non-Muslim youths. In Spain, the young people from Muslim backgrounds were signifi cantly more likely than non-Muslims to say they were \u2018very worried\u2019 about the state of the world; while, in the United Kingdom, Muslim youths were more likely than non- Muslims to say they were \u2018quite worried\u2019. There was no diff erence in the level of concern between Muslim and non-Muslim youths in France, however. There is an apparent contradiction between the low level of interest shown by young people in national politics and yet the high level of concern about the state of the world today. These fi ndings suggest that young people are not oblivious to the social and political problems occurring at a global level, although they appear not to engage with traditional political activity at the national level. This fi nding refl ects other literature published about the attitudes of youth in Europe (Andu\u00edza, 2001; Muxel, 2008; Spannring, 2008). One possible reason for this is that, although they have some level of concern for what is happening in the world, they do not perceive politics as refl ecting their concerns regarding global issues. Only a small proportion of respondents (20% in Spain and the United Kingdom, and 13% in France) thought their lives were aff ected \u2018in many ways\u2019 by what was going on in the world today. Many respondents did, however, think that their lives were aff ected \u2018in some ways\u2019 by global issues; particularly in Spain (67%) and the United Kingdom (63%), although to a lesser degree in France (46%). Once again, Figure 5.3 indicates some variation between Member States in terms of the attitudes of Muslim and non-Muslim youths. In Spain, Muslim youths were slightly more likely than non-Muslims to say they were not aff ected by the problems of the world; although, there was no signifi cant diff erence in this measure among the French or United Kingdom groups. Non-Muslims in the United Kingdom were more likely than Muslims to say that their lives were aff ected in many ways by global issues; although, France and Spain did not refl ect this diff erence. Overall, there is no clear pattern in terms of diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslim youths. To explore in more detail the types of social issues that young people might be concerned about in the world today, they were given a list of items and asked to identify the three that they worried most about (see question 9.2, Appendix II). The list of items included a number of contemporary issues that were related to religious discrimination, such as \u2018racism\u2019, \u2018confl ict between diff erent cultures\u2019, \u2018terrorist attacks\u2019 and \u2018immigration\u2019. However, it also contained items that were unrelated, including \u2018global warming and climate change\u2019, \u2018poverty\u2019, \u2018disease and illness\u2019 and \u2018nuclear weapons\u2019. Overall, the issue that most young people said they were concerned about was poverty (47%), followed by global warming and climate change (45%) and then racism (38%) and confl ict between diff erent cultures (38%). This did vary somewhat between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents across the three Member States, however, as shown in Table 5.1.

        "5. Political interest, trust and citizenship 59 Muslim youths were consistently more likely than non- Muslims to identify racism as a social issue that concerned them. In addition, Muslims were more likely than non- Muslims to say they worried about confl ict between diff erent cultures in France and the United Kingdom, although the reverse was true for the Spanish sample. On the other hand, non-Muslims in all jurisdictions were more likely to say that they were worried about global warming and climate change. On some issues, Muslim and non- Muslim youths prioritised similar issues; for example, in France, poverty emerged as the major issue of concern for both Muslim and non-Muslim youth. Interestingly, there were marginal diff erences between the groups in terms of their concern about terrorist attacks and immigration, although Spanish Muslims were more concerned about immigration than any other group. 5.4. Trust in political institutions The respondents were asked how much they felt they could trust a range of people and institutions, including politicians at both local and national level (see question 8.5 in Appendix II). The results of this question are reported in Figure 5.4, which combines the responses for all three Member States. Overall, there was a substantial diff erence between the level of trust that young people place in proximal fi gures such as parents and, to a lesser extent, friends \u2013 compared with people and institutions that were more distantly or remotely related to their day to day lives. Young people showed a general lack of trust in fi gures of authority and formal local, national and international institutions. The most striking fi nding is the lack of trust in politicians and political representatives: more than half of all respondents (59%) stated that they did not trust politicians, including local councillors and heads of government. The fi ndings are similar for heads of state (such as the King of Spain and the Queen of England). Levels of trust in religious leaders and in criminal justice authorities, such as the police and the courts, were higher than for politicians, but only marginally overall. Levels of trust in people and institutions varied somewhat across the three Member States, although each jurisdiction mirrored the general pattern refl ected in Figure 5.4. On the whole, however, levels of trust were lowest in France and highest among the United Kingdom respondents. There were some diff erences between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents which were very similar across Member States. For example, non-Muslim respondents were signifi cantly more likely than Muslims to Figure 5.3: Degree to which life is affected by things going on in the world today (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Not affected Affected in some ways Affected in many ways Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Table 5.1: Global social issues that young people worry most about (%) France Spain United Kingdom Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Muslim Non-Muslim Poverty 59 50 55 48 36 37 Global warming/climate change 37 45 30 55 42 52 Racism 51 43 49 29 37 28 Confl ict between diff erent cultures 35 29 41 54 46 24 Terrorist attacks 24 22 24 29 44 45 Lack of respect between people 18 26 18 20 23 22 Disease and illness 10 13 14 16 24 29 Inequality between people 18 22 12 16 16 17 Immigration 23 21 37 15 4 8 Nuclear Weapons 7 9 8 11 17 18 Something else 3 4 6 9 5 12 Note: More than one response permitted so columns do not total 100%.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 60 trust their friends (61% compared with 47%, respectively), but they were far less likely to trust religious leaders (16% compared with 50%, respectively). This was the case in all three jurisdictions. However, there were also considerable diff erences across the Member States. With the exception of trust in the United Nations (which was lower among Muslims than non-Muslims), there were no other diff erences between groups in the United Kingdom sample. The French sample also showed few additional diff erences between Muslims and non-Muslims. French Muslims were slightly more likely to trust their parents than non-Muslims, and slightly less likely to trust the courts and judges. However, for the most part there were no signifi cant diff erences between the Muslim and non- Muslim youths in France. The most diff erences were found in the Spanish sample, where the non-Muslim youths were signifi cantly less likely to trust politicians of all types and yet more likely to trust courts and judges, the European Union and the United Nations compared to Muslims. 5.5. Active citizenship Interest in national politics and trust in political institutions, both local and national, were found to be low among the young people in this survey; however, there was some evidence that they were relatively positively disposed towards active citizenship themselves. Potential involvement in some form of active citizenship was explored by asking the respondents to imagine that a favourite park or place where they hang out with their friends was being closed down so that houses could be built on the land (see question 9.8, Appendix II). They were then asked what they would be likely to do in response to this closure. When shown a list of possible forms of action (including writing a letter of complaint to the local authority, starting or signing a petition and getting involved in a protest or demonstration), 60% of all respondents said they would take some kind of action. This is in line with other European studies which have shown that political participation of this type among young people is common (Anduiza, 2001; Spannring, 2008). The most commonly reported form of active citizenship was to write a letter of complaint to the local authority (37%), closely followed by starting or signing a petition (34%), and then joining a protest or a demonstration (26%). These results are encouraging as they suggest that a large proportion of these young people would feel personally compelled to take action in the event of an undesirable event in their local area that would directly aff ect them. Reliance on adults to take action was less common. Around a quarter (23%) of all respondents stated that they would ask their parents to write a letter of complaint; however, reliance on other adults was uncommon, as only 9% said they would contact a Head Teacher and 4% a religious leader. It is salient to point out, however, that a quarter (26%) of young people said they did not know what they would do in these circumstances, and a fi fth (22%) said they would do none of the things on the list to register their protest, which might denote either apathy or a sense of powerlessness. There was some variation in the responses to these questions across Member States, as shown in Figure 5.5. The most noticeable diff erence is that the Spanish respondents were signifi cantly more likely than those in France and the United Kingdom to intimate their likelihood of active citizenship through participating in these activities. In fact, 68% of the Spanish respondents indicated that they would take at least one form of action, compared with 60% of the United Kingdom and 51% of the French respondents. There was little or no diff erence between respondents in France and the United Kingdom in terms of taking direct action (such as writing a letter, protesting or petitioning); however, the United Kingdom respondents were more likely than the French to say that they would take other forms of action, especially related to reliance on adults. Yet a high proportion in all three Member States said they were unsure what they would do.

        "5. Political interest, trust and citizenship 61 In all three Member States, non-Muslim youths were signifi cantly more likely than Muslims to indicate that they would take at least one form of action. Nevertheless, the general pattern was the same, with active citizenship being higher in Spain (64% of Muslims and 71% of non-Muslims) than in the United Kingdom (55% of Muslims and 64% of non-Muslims) and France (47% of Muslims and 55% of non-Muslims). Comparing the Muslim and non-Muslim groups within Member States, the Spanish respondents demonstrated the greatest diff erence. Muslims in Spain were less likely to participate in almost all forms of civic participation compared to non-Muslims, with the exception of contacting a Head Teacher or a religious leader, which they were more likely to say they would do. In contrast, there was little diff erence between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in France or the United Kingdom in terms of their levels of active participation. In these two Member States, the non-Muslims were slightly more likely to sign a petition or to join a protest than the Muslims, but only marginally. Non-Muslims in the United Kingdom were also more likely to contact the media than Muslims, but again this was not a commonly reported form of activism. Importantly, Muslim youths in Spain and the United Kingdom (33% and 30%, respectively) were signifi cantly more likely than non-Muslims (22% and 20%, respectively) to say that they did not know what they would do in these circumstances; although this diff erence did not apply in France. 5.6. Key fi ndings \u2022 Despite showing little interest in national politics, the majority of respondents did report feeling very or fairly worried about the state of the world today. Concern about global issues was highest in France. Muslim youths in the United Kingdom and, particularly, in Spain were more concerned about the state of the world than non-Muslims; however, once again, there was no diff erence in the level of concern between Muslim and non-Muslim youths in France. \u2022 The global issues that young people reported being most concerned about were poverty, global warming and climate change, racism and confl ict between diff erent cultures. Muslims were more likely than non-Muslims in all three Member States to identify racism as an issue that concerned them; and Muslims in France and the United Kingdom also more readily identifi ed confl ict between diff erent cultures as a concern compared to non-Muslims, although the reverse was true among the Spanish sample. By contrast, non-Muslims in all Member States were more likely than Muslims to express concern about global warming and climate change. \u2022 There was little or no diff erence in levels of concern between Muslim and non-Muslim youths around inequalities, lack of respect between people, disease and illness, and nuclear weapons. There were only marginal diff erences between the groups in terms of concern about terrorist attacks and immigration; with Spanish Muslims being most concerned about immigration.

        "6. Peer groups and leisure activities 63 6. Peer groups and leisure activities 6.1. Introduction This chapter examines the characteristics of the peer networks of the young people in this survey. In particular, it explores the size of the peer groups that young people reported having, both in the context of school and their local neighbourhood. The cultural variation within these peer groups is also explored, in terms of how many of their friends were from a diff erent religious or cultural background, spoke a diff erent language or had diff erent skin colour. The chapter also explores young people\u2019s membership of a specifi c group of friends, whether they considered this group a gang, and their reasons for joining this group. Finally, this chapter explores the amount of time young people said they spent with their peers on weekdays and at weekends, and examines the types of leisure activities that they reported participating in with friends. Among those who said they were part of a gang, the peer group\u2019s support for and participation in illegal activities is considered. 6.2. Peer group characteristics 6.2.3. Peer group size and location Young people were asked how many friends they had at school, and separately in their local neighbourhood. The vast majority of young people across the three Member States indicated that they had a large number of friends, with over half saying overall that they had more than 10 friends either at school or in their local neighbourhood, or both. Only a very small minority of young people said that they did not have any friends. Figure 6.1 shows the pattern of peer group size across the three Member States for both friends at school and in the local neighbourhood. This fi gure illustrates that at least a third of young people associated with peer groups consisting of more than twenty individuals at school or in their neighbourhood. Generally speaking, young people reported having more friends at school than in their local area, although the extent of the diff erence varied across the Member States. There was very little diff erence in peer group size at school across the three Member States; however, peer group size in the local neighbourhood did vary signifi cantly, with French youths having most friends \u2013 considering actual numbers \u2013 in their local area. Within the United Kingdom sample, there was no diff erence in peer group size between Muslim and non- Muslim respondents, either in terms of the number of friends at school or in the local neighbourhood. Similarly, the Spanish Muslims reported no signifi cant diff erence in the size of their peer group in the local neighbourhood compared to the non-Muslims; although they had slightly fewer friends at school than non-Muslims. The Muslim youths within the French sample, however, were signifi cantly more likely to report having large peer The survey asked young people about issues such as the following: \u2022 Perception of their peer groups \u2022 Membership in various informal groups or \u2018gangs\u2019 \u2022 If these groups have political or religious agendas \u2022 If these groups were involved in illegal activities \u2022 Unfair treatment in and by such groups Figure 6.1: Size of peer group at school and in the local neighbourhood, by Member State (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 None 1-5 6-10 11-20 More than 20 Neighbourhood School Neighbourhood School Neighbourhood School Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 64 groups compared to the non-Muslims. For example, just over half of French Muslims said they had more than 20 friends at school (53%) and in the local neighbourhood (54%) compared to the non-Muslims (42% and 39%, respectively). On the whole, however, the patterns observed in Figure 6.1 were broadly mirrored for both Muslim and non-Muslim youths. There was a high level of inconsistency among young people in terms of their peer group size at school and the neighbourhood. In only a third (36%) of all cases did young people have the same sized peer group in both contexts. Most (46%) young people had more friends at school compared to the neighbourhood; with only 18% having more friends in their local area compared to school. The United Kingdom respondents were most likely to say they had more friends at school than in the local neighbourhood (58% compared to 44% in Spain and 36% in France). Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in Spain and the United Kingdom did not diff er signifi cantly on this measure; however, French Muslims were signifi cantly less likely to have more friends at school than in the local neighbourhood (28% compared to 41% of non-Muslims), but more likely to say they had the same number of friends in school and their local area (49% compared to 37% of non-Muslims). 6.2.2. Cultural variation within peer group The cultural backgrounds of the respondents in this survey are wide and varied, as shown in chapter 2, which indicates that the samples were drawn from very multi-cultural locations. In order to determine how well young people socialised with others from diff erent backgrounds, they were asked how many of their friends were diff erent from them in terms of cultural background, religious affi liation, language spoken and skin colour. In fact, the vast majority of young people said that at least some of their friends were diff erent from them in each of these ways. Overall, 84% had at least some friends who belonged to a diff erent religion, 87% had friends from a diff erent cultural background, 83% had friends with a diff erent skin colour and 71% had friends who spoke a diff erent language. Figure 6.2 highlights the strong degree of diversity among peer groups in terms of religious affi liation and cultural background across the three Member States, and shows that the general pattern is once again broadly replicated. The fi ndings on skin colour and language are not presented here; however, they show the same general picture. Overall, young people in France were most likely to say that some or most of their friends were diff erent to them in terms of religion, cultural background, skin colour and language than those from Spain and the United Kingdom. There were some signifi cant diff erences in responses to this question by Muslim and non-Muslim respondents, however. Within the Spanish and United Kingdom samples, Muslim youths were signifi cantly more likely than non-Muslims to say that all or some of their friends were diff erent from them on the basis of religion, cultural background, skin colour and language. For example, 89% of United Kingdom Muslims and 93% of Spanish Muslims reported that at least some of their friends were of a diff erent cultural background, compared to 78% and 67% of non-Muslims, respectively. In France, there was no signifi cant diff erence between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in the extent of variation on the basis of religion and cultural background, and only slight diff erences on the basis of skin colour and language. Nevertheless, the overall picture among both Muslims and non-Muslims was one of multicultural diversity among peer groups. 6.2.3. Membership of a group or \u2018gang\u2019 In order to diff erentiate between friends generally and more specifi c friendship groups, the respondents were asked whether they had a certain group of friends that Figure 6.2: Religious and cultural variation among peer groups, by Member State (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 No friends Some friends All or most friends Culture Religion Culture Religion Culture Religion Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "6. Peer groups and leisure activities 65 they spent time with, doing things together or just hanging about. Four out of fi ve young people overall said that they belonged to such a group, although this was less common in France (71%) than in Spain (84%) and the United Kingdom (85%). In general, Muslim and non-Muslim respondents were almost equally likely to be part of a group of friends (83% and 86%, respectively); however, non-Muslim youths in Spain (91%) and France (74%) were signifi cantly more likely to be part of a group than Muslim respondents (73% and 67%, respectively). Only a fi fth (22%) of respondents said that they would call their group of friends a \u2018gang\u2019, although the French respondents were more than twice as likely to report being part of a gang (35%) than either the United Kingdom (15%) or the Spanish (16%) youths. 34 Interestingly, the Muslim respondents in both the United Kingdom and Spain (21% in each Member State) were signifi cantly more likely to report being part of a gang than the non-Muslims (11% and 14%, respectively). Muslim respondents in France were also slightly more likely to report being in a gang than the non-Muslims (38% and 33%, respectively), although the diff erence was not signifi cant. Even though due care was taken about how the questionnaire captured phrases like \u2018group\u2019 or \u2018gang\u2019 in the diff erent language versions, diverging shades of the meaning between the three Member States and even between diff erent groups cannot be excluded. 34 The term \u2018gang\u2019 was translated to \u2018bande\u2019 in French and to \u2018banda juvenil\u2019 in Spanish. These terms might have slightly diff erent positive and negative connotations in the respective language. 6.2.4. Reasons for joining the group The respondents were shown a list of reasons for joining a group of friends and asked which of these were important for them (see question 4.12, appendix II). The ten most commonly reported reasons are shown in Figure 6.3. This clearly illustrates that young people joined groups predominantly to socialise with other people, since by far the most common reasons given were to make friends (81%), hang out together (58%), for company (47%), to participate in group activities (46%), and to share secrets with each other (41%). It was far less common for young people to join a group for protection (22%) or in order for them to keep out of trouble (21%). There were some diff erences between Member States, as shown in Figure 6.3. Whereas the United Kingdom respondents were more likely than those from France and Spain to join the group just to hang out, the French respondents were more likely than the others to join in order to participate in group activities or to share secrets and the Spanish respondents were more likely than those in the other two Member States to join for company or to make friends. In all three Member States, there was little or no signifi cant diff erence between the proportion of Muslim and non-Muslim respondents who said that they had joined their group for company, to take part in group activities, to share secrets with each other or because a friend was part of the group. Among the Spanish respondents, non-Muslims were a little more likely to say they joined the group to make friends (88% compared with 79%, respectively), although there was no diff erence between groups in France or the United Kingdom. In France, Muslim youths were more likely than non-Muslims to say that they joined the group just to hang out (47% compared with 37%, respectively); whereas it was the non-Muslims in Spain (62%) and the United Kingdom Figure 6.3: Most commonly reported reasons for joining a group, by Member State (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 France Spain UK To feel important A friend was in the group To keep out of trouble For protection To feel I belong To share secrets Take part in group activities For company To hang out To make friends Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 66 (79%) who were more likely to have joined the group to hang out than the Muslim youths (49% and 70%, respectively). Among the United Kingdom respondents, Muslim youths were far more likely to join the group for protection (31%) or to keep out of trouble (28%) compared to the non-Muslim respondents (17% and 15%, respectively); however, there was no such diff erence in France and only a slight diff erence on keeping out of trouble in Spain (25% of Muslims compared to 17% of non-Muslims). Only 10% overall said they joined the group to get away with illegal activities, and this did not diff er signifi cantly across Member States or between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents. 6.3. Peer group activities 6.3.1. Time spent socialising with peers The survey asked respondents how many hours, on average, they would spend per day socialising with friends on weekdays (outside of school time) and on weekend days. Not surprisingly, young people in all three Member States spent more time socialising with peers at the weekend than on weekdays, as shown in Figure 6.4. Nevertheless, around a third of respondents in each Member State indicated that they would spend an average of more than four hours socialising with peers on weekdays, even when school time was excluded. Closer to a half said they spent more than four hours per day with friends at weekends, on average. In other words, it was common for young people to spend a lot of time socialising with friends in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. By adding the answers from the questions on how much time the young people spent socialising with peers on weekdays and at weekends, it was estimated that they spent on average a minimum of 17.7 hours with friends per week. This varied slightly across Member State, with the Spanish respondents reporting a lower number of hours spent with friends on average (16.9) compared with those in the United Kingdom (17.9) and France (18.3). There was no signifi cant diff erence in the number of hours spent with friends between Muslim (16.5) and non-Muslims (17.1) in Spain; whereas, the average weekly number of hours spent socialising with friends for Muslims in France (17.6) and the United Kingdom (15.8) was lower than for non- Muslims (18.7 and 19.2, respectively). The diff erence was most marked among the United Kingdom respondents. 6.3.2. Leisure activities with friends The respondents were given a list of common leisure time activities and asked what kinds of things they did with their friends (see question 10.7, Appendix II). As shown in Figure 6.5, a large proportion of young people reported participating in conventional leisure activities with friends, such as going shopping or out to eat with friends or socialising at their home or that of a friend. Hanging out in public places was the third most common activity. A relatively small minority of young people in each Member State said that they and their friends did illegal things together. French respondents were more likely than those in other Member States to go for walks or bike rides or chat about the news or world events; while Spanish respondents were more likely to hang out in public, chat about parents and school or do their homework with friends. The United Kingdom respondents were more likely than the French or Spanish youths to stay at home or go to a friend\u2019s home and to watch TV and fi lms together. There was least diff erence in response to this question between the Muslim and non-Muslim respondents in France. French non-Muslims were, however, more likely to watch TV or fi lms, hang about public places, play on the computer or internet and go for walks or bike rides, and Figure 6.4: Number of hours spent socialising with friends during the week (outside school time) and at the weekends, by Member State (%) France Spain UK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 None Up to 1 hours Up to 2 hours Up to 4 hours More than 4 hours Weekends Weekdays Weekends Weekdays Weekends Weekdays Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "6. Peer groups and leisure activities 67 less likely to watch or play sports, compared to Muslims. Compared to Muslims, non-Muslims in Spain and the United Kingdom were more likely to hang about public places, do illegal things with friends, but also to stay at home or go to a friend\u2019s home, watch TV or fi lms, go shopping or out to eat and chat about their parents or school. Muslims in all three Member States were more likely to worship together with their friends than non- Muslims, although this could be explained by the fact that they were more likely to worship overall. 6.3.3. Antisocial activities among the group or \u2018gang\u2019 There has been a considerable amount of research across Europe on youth groups and gangs (see Decker and Weerman, 2005) and on the involvement of groups of friends in antisocial behaviour and delinquency (see Hindelang et al., 1981; Junger-Tas et al., 1994). The main fi ndings from these research studies indicate that young people often off end in groups, and that identifying themselves with a \u2018gang\u2019 increases the likelihood of their off ending. No defi nition for the term \u2018gang\u2019 was given in this study; however, it was true that those who reported being in a gang were signifi cantly more likely to say that their group thought it was acceptable to do illegal things (49%) and that they actually engaged in illegal acts (47%) compared to those who did not consider their group to be a gang (28% and 25%, respectively). However, this conceals an important diff erence between the Muslim and non- Muslim respondents, which is shown in Figure 6.6. Despite being more likely to say that their group of friends was a gang, Muslim respondents who did so were signifi cantly less likely to say that their group thought it acceptable to do illegal acts or that they actually took part in illegal acts compared with non-Muslims; a result that could indicate a diff erent interpretation of the meaning of \u2018gang\u2019.

This may indicate that there is a diff erent understanding or usage of the term \u2018gang\u2019 between groups. This is in addition to the earlier caution that the translation of a term such as \u2018gang\u2019 is problematic. 6.4. Key fi ndings \u2022 As a refl ection of the survey locations, there was strong cultural diversity among peer groups, with the vast majority of young people saying that at least some of their friends belonged to a diff erent religion, had a diff erent cultural background, had a diff erent skin colour and spoke a diff erent language. \u2022 Four out of fi ve young people belonged to a specifi c peer group, although this was less common in France. Muslim youths in France and Spain were less likely to be part of a group of friends than non-Muslims. \u2022 Only a fi fth of respondents said that they would call their group of friends a \u2018gang\u2019, although the French respondents were more than twice as likely to do so as in Spain or the United Kingdom. Considering their group a gang was more common for Muslims than non-Muslims. \u2022 Most young people joined their peer group in order to socialise with other people; by making friends, hanging out together, having company and participating in group activities or sharing secrets. Few young people joined a group for protection or to keep out of trouble. \u2022 Those who said their peer group was a \u2018gang\u2019 were more likely to say that their group considered it acceptable to do illegal things and that they actually engaged in illegal acts, compared to those who did not consider their group a gang. \u2022 Muslim respondents were more likely to say that their group of friends was a \u2018gang\u2019 than non-Muslims, but Muslims who did consider themselves to be in a gang were less likely to be supportive of or to participate in illegal activities in the group than non-Muslims who called their group a gang, which may indicate a diff erent understanding of the term \u2018gang\u2019.

        "7. Explaining attitudes towards and involvement in violence 69 7. Explaining attitudes towards and involvement in violence 7.1. Introduction The aim of this chapter is to bring together the fi ndings from the previous chapters in order to explore the overarching research question for this study: what is the relationship between young people\u2019s experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation and the identifi cation of attitudes and activities that are supportive of violence? To do this, the chapter uses two measures of violent attitudes and two measures of violent behaviour (these are described in more detail in Chapter 4). The attitudinal measures included in this analysis are: \u2022 scoring above average on a scale of positive attitudes towards violence (based on a scale ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no support for violence and 1 indicates strong support for violence); and \u2022 agreeing that war and/or terrorism are justifi ed (a simple binary measure of yes or no). The two measures of violent behaviour were binary measures that indicated whether the young person had been involved in emotional or physical violence (yes or no). In an attempt to explain why some young people may be more strongly supportive of violent behaviour and more inclined to participate in violence, binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether there was a relationship between these measures and a range of possible explanatory variables, already described in earlier chapters. Logistic regression is a form of multiple regression that is used when the dependent variables (in this case support for and involvement in violence) consist of two discrete categories. This form of statistical modelling allows one to assess the relative importance of each factor or combination of factors in predicting young people\u2019s propensity to support violence and to be involved in violence, while simultaneously taking each of the other possible explanatory variables into account (see Field, 2004). The logistic regression modelling analysis, which was carried out separately for each Member State, looked at: \u2022 whether young people had experienced discrimination; \u2022 measures of social marginalisation (feelings of alienation, feeling unhappy with their lives and having no-one to talk to about private matters); \u2022 experience of emotional or physical violence as a victim for reasons of cultural background, skin colour, spoken language or religion; \u2022 concerns about general global issues (the state of the world today); \u2022 concerns about specifi c global issues (racism, inequality between people, confl ict between cultures, terrorism and immigration); \u2022 lack of interest in politics and lack of trust in politicians; \u2022 perceived ability to take action in the event of a threat to a local resource for young people (active citizenship); \u2022 delinquent peer group activities (calling their group of friends a \u2018gang\u2019, participating in illegal activities with their group of friends and giving illegal activity as a reason for joining their group); and \u2022 the young person\u2019s individual characteristics (age, gender and whether the young person was a Muslim or a non-Muslim). The results of the analysis are presented as tables showing which factors emerged as statistically signifi cant in terms of explaining why some individuals were likely to have more positive attitudes towards violence and were more likely to have been involved in emotionally or physically violent behaviour. For simplicity, the results are presented as showing whether the explanatory variable has a \u2018weak\u2019 eff ect (an odds ratio of between 1 and 1.4), a \u2018moderate\u2019 eff ect (an odds ratio of between 1.5 and 1.9), a \u2018strong\u2019 eff ect (an odds ratio between 2.0 and 4.9) or a \u2018very strong\u2019 eff ect (an odds ratio of 5.0 or more). Where the variable had a negative eff ect on attitudes towards violence or involvement in violent behaviour, this is also indicated. 7.2. Explaining attitudes towards violence 7.2.1. Attitudes supportive of individual violence Table 7.1, below, presents the results of the logistic regression analysis to explore the possible explanatory factors for having an above average score on the scale of attitudes towards violence. A logistic regression model using the eleven explanatory factors listed in the fi rst column of Table 7.1 was fi tted separately to the data from each of the three countries. This table shows the factors that emerged as signifi cant in terms of explaining why some individuals were more supportive of using violence in a variety of situations compared to those who had only average or below average scores. Overall, there were three factors that the models for all three Member States shared: \u2022 being male; \u2022 being part of a group that the individual defi ned as a \u2018gang\u2019; and \u2022 being involved in illegal activities with that group.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 70 These three factors were all found to strongly or moderately explain having a more supportive attitude (than average) towards using violence in all three Member States. These fi ndings suggest that anti-violence initiatives targeted at problematic male youth groups are likely to be equally benefi cial in all three Member States. There were also some country specifi c factors that emerged in terms of explaining involvement in violence, as Table 7.1 shows. Having a Muslim religious background emerged as strongly predictive of having positive attitudes towards violence only among the French sample, whereas there was no indication that religious background had any bearing on attitudes in Spain and the United Kingdom. In addition, French youths who had been victims of discrimination and those who were distrustful of politicians were also more likely to have stronger that average attitudes towards violence. Experience of discrimination did not emerge as signifi cant among the respondents in Spain and the United Kingdom, However, young people in these two samples who had greater scores on a measure of alienation or exclusion were highly likely to be supportive of violence, although this was not apparent in France. Among the United Kingdom youths, those who reported being worried about immigration and confl ict between cultures at a global level were more supportive of using violence at the individual level. While there was no indication that Muslims were more likely to support the use of violence than non-Muslims in the United Kingdom, young people who had experienced either emotional or physical victimisation for reasons of their cultural or religious background, their skin colour or for speaking a diff erent language, were more likely to have stronger than average attitudes supporting the use of personal violence. 7.2.2. Attitudes supportive of global violence There was no consistent pattern across the three Member States in terms of explaining young people\u2019s likelihood to agree that global violence (in the form of war and/or terrorism) was justifi able for dealing with the problems of the world \u2013 there was no consistent pattern across the three Member States. It is interesting to note from Table 7.2 that young people in France who were supportive of war or terrorism shared some characteristics with young people in Spain and some other characteristics with those in the United Kingdom; however, there was no overlap at all between Spain and the United Kingdom. In France, young males and those from a Muslim background were at greater risk of supporting the use of war and/or terrorism when controlling for a range of other factors. Risk was also greater among those who felt highly alienated within their communities, and among those young people who were involved in youth groups who supported and engaged in illegal activities. This indicates that levels of support for global violence in France would be likely to be highest among young, alienated Muslim males who were members of delinquent gangs. In Spain, risk of support for war and/ or terrorism was also greatest among young Muslims and those who experienced greater feelings of alienation. However, being male and part of a delinquent youth group did not emerge as signifi cant risk factors. Those who were most worried about the state of the world were, however, at lower risk of supporting these forms of global violence, which is indicative of some form of moral indignation for such acts. Among the UK respondents, religious background and experience of alienation did not explain young people\u2019s attitudes towards war and/or terrorism. However, like the French sample, young males and those who were involved in delinquent youth gangs were at greatest risk of harbouring these kinds of attitudes. This was particularly the case for the older teenagers in the UK, and, notably, among those who reported being \u2018happy\u2019 with their lives. In other words, these fi ndings suggest that young males who show a proclivity towards group- based anti-social behaviour at the local level are also likely to favour (attitudinally) the use of violence to solve global problems, at least in France and the United Kingdom.

Explaining involvement in violence Expressing opinions that are in favour of using violence, either at an individual level or a global level, is not necessarily indicative of a tendency to use violence. However, some similar characteristics to those described above emerged among those who said they had used emotional and physical violence. Exactly the same group of explanatory variables was used in this analysis, with the exception that the two attitudinal variables in support of violence were included as potential explanatory factors for involvement in emotional and physical violence. Table 7.3 shows that in all three Member States young people who felt highly alienated or excluded and those who had been a victim of either emotional or physical violence themselves because of their cultural or religious background, skin colour or language were highly likely to be involved in using emotional violence towards others. In addition, in France and the United Kingdom, young people who reported that they had been victims of discrimination were highly likely to be emotionally violent towards others. These fi ndings demonstrate the widespread importance of addressing issues of social marginalisation and discriminatory behaviour towards those of diff erent cultural origins among young people. Nevertheless, there was no indication that Muslim youths were more likely to engage in emotional violence than non-Muslims; in fact, the reverse was true among the Spanish respondents. Among the United Kingdom respondents only, those who reported being worried about racism as a global social issue were less likely to engage in emotional violence than those who were not concerned about racism. As with attitudes that were supportive of violence, the use of emotional violence was also explained to an extent by the tendency to associate with a delinquent peer group. In France, young people who said their group was a gang and those whose peer group engaged in illegal activities were likely to have used emotional violence towards others. Youths in the United Kingdom who were part of a delinquent youth group and Spanish youths who said they joined their peer group in order to engage in illegal acts were also engaged in emotional violence. Yet again, these fi ndings demonstrate the importance of addressing the wider problems associated with troublesome youth groups. In Spain and the United Kingdom, younger teenagers and those who had stronger than average opinions in favour of using violence were more likely to use emotional violence towards others than older teenagers or those who did not support violence generally; although, this was not apparent among the French youths. Interestingly, being male emerged as an explanatory factor for emotional violence only among the United Kingdom respondents, and then only weakly in comparison to other variables. This suggests that emotional violence is as likely to be infl icted by females as males in France and Spain when controlling for these other factors.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 72 There was some similarity in the explanatory factors that emerged from the regression modelling for emotional and physical violence, although there were also some distinct diff erences. Whereas involvement in emotional violence was only weakly related to being male in the United Kingdom, and not at all gendered in France or Spain, Table 7.4 shows that being male was strongly indicative of involvement in physical violence across the three Member States (this is predictable, but is a useful indicator that adds to the reliability of the study as a whole). In addition, being a member of a delinquent peer group and having stronger than average attitudes in support of using violence at an individual level were highly likely to lead to involvement in physical violence in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Having attitudes that were supportive of war and/or terrorism at a more global level were moderately signifi cant in explaining engagement in physical violence among the French respondents only. These fi ndings yet again demonstrate the cross-national importance of targeting male youth groups, particularly those who believe strongly that it is justifi able to use violent solutions to solve the everyday problems that they face. Nevertheless, to be eff ective any policy response would have to address the issues of discrimination and marginalisation among such youth groups. For example, in France and Spain, young people who stated that they had been victims of discrimination were far more likely to engage in physical violence than those who were not discriminated against. Furthermore, youths in Spain and the United Kingdom who reported feeling alienated and marginalised within their communities, and youths in the United Kingdom who were victimised on the basis of their cultural or religious origins, were highly likely to be physically violent towards others. Importantly, there is no evidence from this study that the religious background of the respondents is an indicator for engagement in physical violence once other aspects of discrimination and marginalisation have been accounted for. There is some indication from Table 7.4 \u2013 although the fi ndings are complex and require further exploration in relation to other factors \u2013 that involvement in physical violence was related to aspects of concern that young people faced, although this was not uniform across Member States. For example, Spanish youths who expressed concern about issues of inequality between people at a global level were more likely to engage in physical violence than those who were not concerned about this issue. Similarly, Spanish youths who were worried about terrorism were more likely to be violent towards others than those who were not worried about this issue; whereas French youths who were worried about immigration were less likely to be violent than those who were not worried. Concerns about global issues did not emerge as an explanatory factor for being involved in physical violence for respondents in the United Kingdom. In both France and the United Kingdom, engagement in physical violence was more likely among younger than older teenagers. It is apparent from these fi ndings that there is a high degree of overlap between Member States in terms of the possible explanatory factors for both attitudes in support of violence and actual engagement in violent behaviour. This analysis shows that policies need to be targeted at young people who cause problems within their own communities, particularly in the form of youth groups that are predominantly male. However, such policies must also address the endemic problem of discrimination and social marginalisation among young people in order to have some impact on violent attitudes and behaviours. There is a strong indication that addressing attitudes that are supportive of violence would go some way towards tackling involvement in both emotional and physical violence, although this would need to be adopted as part of a wider package of measures. Nevertheless, a uniform policy approach to resolving issues of violence would not be appropriate as diff erent factors emerged as being signifi cant in explaining attitudes and behaviours across the three Member States. Policy makers need to be attuned to the cultural diff erences across Member States in order to properly understand the issues underlying youth violence.

Explaining attitudes towards and involvement in violence 73 discrimination and marginalisation are not restricted to Muslim youths \u2013 although the reasons behind types of negative experience may be diff erent between Muslim and non-Muslim youth. 7.4. Key fi ndings \u2022 Being more supportive than average in their attitudes towards using violence at an individual level (for example, for self-defence or because they were insulted) was at least partially explained in all three Member States by being male, being part of a group that the individual defi ned as a \u2018gang\u2019, and being involved in illegal activities with that group. \u2022 Being from a Muslim background and being a victim of discrimination were predictive of having positive attitudes towards violence only for French youths. Whereas in Spain and the United Kingdom, young people who were more alienated or socially marginalised were likely to be supportive of violence. \u2022 In France and Spain, Muslim youths and those who felt socially marginalised had high levels of support for war and / or terrorism to solve the problems of the world. In France and the United Kingdom, support for such global violence was greater among young males than females, and among those who were members of delinquent peer groups. \u2022 In all Member States, young people who felt socially marginalised and those who had been a victim of violence because of their cultural or religious background, skin colour or language were more likely to use emotional violence towards others. In France and the United Kingdom, young people who had experienced general discrimination were also likely to be emotionally violent towards others. \u2022 In Spain, respondents from a non-Muslim background were more likely to be involved in using emotional violence, whereas in France and the United Kingdom religious background had no impact on this type of violence. \u2022 In France, Spain and the United Kingdom, the use of emotional and physical violence by young people was strongly related to their likelihood of associating with a delinquent peer group and engaging in illegal activities with that group. \u2022 Emotional violence was as likely to be infl icted by females as males in France and Spain, and being male was only weakly predictive of involvement in emotional violence among the United Kingdom respondents. However, being male was strongly indicative of involvement in physical violence across the three Member States. \u2022 The use of physical violence was associated with having stronger positive attitudes towards using violence at an individual level in all three Member States; although, supportive attitudes for global violence was moderately signifi cant in explaining physical violence only among French respondents. \u2022 In France and Spain, young people who had experienced discrimination were far more likely to engage in physical violence than those who were not discriminated against.

        "8. Conclusions 75 8. Conclusions It is important to bear in mind when interpreting the fi ndings in this report that the survey \u2013 based on 3,000 interviews with young people, aged between 12 and 18 years, across the three Member States \u2013 cannot be said to be representative of all young people from France, Spain and the United Kingdom. This is so given the sampling strategy, which was designed to ensure a large enough sample of young Muslim people and which, therefore, was concentrated in particular geographical areas. Nevertheless, the fi ndings provide important information about the experiences of young people from both Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds that can be used by policy makers to address some of the key issues facing young people in terms of their experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation, and how this relates to their attitudes towards the use of violence and their involvement in behaving violently towards others. For most of the young people in this study, their religious and cultural backgrounds were important aspects of their individual identities and this was particularly the case for young people whose families had migrated to their country of residence. In particular, Muslim youths were more likely to attend a place of worship and to worship more frequently in Spain and the United Kingdom, although this was less so in France. There was some indication that the Muslim youths sampled in this survey may have been less affl uent than young people from other backgrounds, on the basis of information collected on entitlement to educational subsidies, and more tenuously on parental employment, and on the basis that their parents were more likely to be recent immigrants; however, this is not certain as information on household income could not be collected. Perhaps recent immigration is a factor which partly explains why young Muslims were less likely than non-Muslims to associate themselves with the dominant culture of their country of residence, particularly in France; although they were very strongly supportive of their own cultural background. These fi ndings are important as they indicate that young people are sensitive to cultural and religious diff erences and so individual identity must be understood in the context of such diff erences. It is a positive sign that this study found that most young people had not been discriminated against and, in fact, the vast majority were happy with their lives and did not appear to feel alienated or socially marginalised. Nevertheless, some young people had experienced discrimination and marginalisation, and there were diff erences between the experiences of Muslim and non-Muslim youths in each of the three Member States that deserve much greater attention. Around one in four young people in each Member State reported they had ever been unfairly treated or picked on (experiences of discrimination). Muslim youths were signifi cantly more likely than non-Muslims to say that this had happened to them in France and Spain; although, there was no diff erence between them in the United Kingdom. Young people were picked on for a range of reasons, including their cultural background, religion, skin colour and language; with Muslims being particularly likely to experience religious discrimination. However, there were many other reasons why young people were unfairly treated that did not relate to cultural or religious background. Moreover, young people who experienced discrimination were signifi cantly more likely to be socially Main conclusions Both violent attitudes and behaviours were strongly predicted by being male and being part of a delinquent peer group that was disposed to engaging in illegal activities. Young people who had experienced social marginalisation and discrimination were highly likely to support the use of violence and, more especially, to engage in emotional and physical violence themselves. Involvement in emotional violence (such as being teased or made fun of, or threatened in some way) was increased among those who had said that they had experienced violence because of their cultural or religious backgrounds; however, this was not restricted to Muslim youths. There was no indication that Muslim youths in any Member State were more likely than non-Muslims to be emotionally or physically violent towards others, once other aspects of discrimination and social marginalisation had been taken into account. Some young people indicated that they would support the use of violence in the case of self-defence or to protect someone else, but most young people showed no support for engaging in violence \u2018just for fun\u2019 (mindless violence). Some Muslim respondents were more likely to indicate their support for violence than non-Muslims \u2013 particularly if their religion was insulted; however, there is no indication that these respondents would translate their thoughts into action. Discrimination and marginalisation are not restricted to Muslim youths and religious affi liation is less important in determining young people\u2019s involvement in violent behaviour than their peer group characteristics and their broader attitudes and experiences.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 76 marginalised and unhappy compared to others. A key factor in discriminatory behaviour (according to the victims) was that young people were merely identifi ed by others as being \u2018diff erent\u2019, which suggests a need to tackle issues of general intolerance as well as specifi c areas of targeted discrimination. The fi ndings on young people\u2019s attitudes towards violence did not suggest that there was large-scale support for using violence to resolve individual problems, and they were particularly unsupportive of violence just \u2018for fun\u2019. Young people were more supportive of activities where violence might be needed for self-defence or to protect someone else than they were for other types of situation, such as in the case of their religion being insulted. Muslim youths in France and Spain were more likely to demonstrate support for violence than non- Muslims, particularly if their religion was insulted. While there were no diff erences in the responses between Muslims and non-Muslim youth in the UK on most items concerning support for violence, UK Muslim respondents, as well as Muslim respondents in France and Spain, were signifi cantly more ready to accept the use of violence when their religion was insulted, compared with non- Muslim respondents. Support for more globalised forms of violence, including using war and terrorism to solve the problems of the world, was less common. Muslim respondents did not diff er from non-Muslim respondents, overall (the data from the three countries combined), regarding their views on the use of war. The Muslims respondents overall were slightly more likely to be supportive of the use of terrorism than non-Muslims; however, it is important to note that being sympathetic towards the use of violence does not necessarily translate into violent behaviour. Experience of violence among young people was not particularly common, particularly physical violence, although for a small minority it was a fairly regular occurrence. Nevertheless, patterns in experience of violence varied considerably across the three Member States. Around half of all young people had experienced at least one incident of emotional violence (such as being teased or made fun of, threatened or excluded by a group of friends), although it was less common to experience actual physical violence (such as being assaulted or hit with a weapon), and even rarer to have perpetrated emotional or physical violence against others. French youths were the most likely to be exposed to violence, both as victims and off enders, and French Muslim youths were the most likely to experience physical violence as a victim and a perpetrator. Experience of violence was least common in Spain, both for victims and off enders; although here, the non-Muslims were as likely to be victims of violence and more likely to be perpetrators than the Muslim youths. In the United Kingdom, non- Muslims were more likely than Muslims to experience emotional violence, but there was no diff erence in exposure to physical violence or committing acts of emotional or physical violence. So while attitudes towards violence were more supportive among Muslim youths, there was no evidence that they were more extensively or consistently exposed to violence in Spain or the United Kingdom; although this was clearly not the case in France. In all three Member States, however, the reasons given by Muslims for being both a victim and a perpetrator of violence did tend to focus on issues relating to cultural or religious diff erence. Young people\u2019s level of interest in institutional national politics was low overall; however, the majority did say that they were worried about the state of the world today and clearly evidenced political consciousness in their responses to global issues. Most young people thought their lives were aff ected to at least some extent by what was going on in the world around them, and there was little diff erence between Muslim and non-Muslims in this respect. However, Muslim youths were more likely to be concerned about global issues relating to religious and cultural identity, such as racism, compared to non-Muslims who were more likely to be concerned about more generic issues such as global warming and climate change. These fi ndings indicate that young Muslims have a much greater level of concern about tolerance towards cultural identities both at a personal and a global level which is likely to have some impact on their understanding of the way in which such issues are dealt with politically. There was a general lack of trust in authority fi gures and social institutions, with politicians being rated as least trustworthy in society by both Muslims and non-Muslims. However, Muslim youths appeared less willing to participate in some form of protest or active citizenship than non-Muslims. Peer groups are an important aspect of young people\u2019s lives and the majority of people in this study stated that they had a group of friends at school and/or in their local neighbourhood, many of which were very large peer groups. This study found strong cultural diversity among peer groups, which may be related to the sampling method which targeted areas with a large Muslim component. The vast majority of young people said that at least some of their friends belonged to a diff erent religion, had a diff erent cultural background, had a diff erent skin colour and spoke a diff erent language. Cultural diversity was greatest among the French respondents, regardless of whether respondents were Muslim or non-Muslim. Most young people said that they had a specifi c group of friends that they spent a lot of time with, although Muslims in France and Spain were less likely to be part of a group than non-Muslims. One in fi ve respondents described their group of friends as a \u2018gang\u2019, with French respondents around twice as likely to do so those in Spain or the United Kingdom. Many young people participated in conventional leisure activities with friends, with few young people saying they did illegal Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "8. Conclusions 77 things together. However, those who said their peer group was a gang were more likely to say that their group considered it acceptable to do illegal things and that they actually engaged in illegal acts, compared to those who did not consider their group a gang. Interestingly, being part of a gang was more common for Muslims than non- Muslims; however, Muslims who did consider themselves to be in a gang were less likely to be supportive of or to participate in illegal activities in the group than non- Muslims who called their group a gang. One of the main aims of this study was to understand the relationship between experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation and attitudes towards and involvement in violence, taking into account some of the other key characteristics of young people\u2019s lives. This study found consistent evidence that both violent attitudes and behaviours were strongly predicted in all three Member States by being male and being part of a delinquent peer group that was disposed to engaging in illegal activities, whether or not that peer group was described as a gang. In addition, there was evidence in all three Member States that young people who had experienced social marginalisation and discrimination were highly likely to support the use of violence and, more especially, to engage in emotional and physical violence themselves. Involvement in emotional violence was increased among those who had said that they had experienced violence because of their cultural or religious backgrounds; however, this was not restricted to Muslim youths. The fi ndings indicated that young Muslims were more supportive than non-Muslims in their attitudes towards using violence in France and, to a lesser extent, Spain; however, there was no indication that Muslim youths in any Member State were more likely than non-Muslims to be emotionally or physically violent towards others, once other aspects of discrimination and social marginalisation had been taken into account. Nevertheless, the use of physical violence was associated with having stronger positive attitudes towards using violence at an individual level in all three Member States; although, supportive attitudes for global violence was moderately signifi cant in explaining physical violence only among French respondents. This study shows a high degree of overlap between Member States in terms of the factors that might contribute towards explaining attitudes in support of violence and actual engagement in violent behaviour among young people. The results indicate that to be eff ective, policies may need to be targeted at young people who cause problems within their own communities, particularly in the form of youth groups that are predominantly male. However, in order to have the most widespread impact on violent attitudes and behaviours such policies must also address the experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation among young people and seek to understand the causes of such experiences. There is not a directly symmetrical relationship between attitudes that are supportive of violence and actual experience of violence, particularly among young Muslims who display a greater degree of verbal support than actual engagement in violence. However, there is some evidence to suggest that addressing attitudes that are supportive of violence would go some way towards tackling involvement in both emotional and physical violence, particularly if this were adopted as part of a wider package of measures. Despite the fact that there were many similarities in the fi ndings between Member States, it is also important to realise that the three countries included in this research had considerable diff erences in terms of young people\u2019s experiences. It was recognised in the introductory chapter to this report that the three samples varied somewhat due to their cultural and historical development, including the immigration histories, of each country, and that this was likely to have some impact on the fi ndings. While this research cannot be said to be representative of all European Member States, as only three were included in the sample, the fi ndings indicate that a uniform cross-European policy approach to addressing issues of discrimination, marginalisation and violence have to be adjusted to the local situation in order to be eff ective in tackling violence as diff erent factors appeared to explain attitudes and behaviours within the three Member States. For this reason, policy makers need to be attuned to the cultural diff erences and issues of intolerance aff ecting young people\u2019s lives in each Member State in order to properly understand the underlying reasons for youth violence. Further research to understand these diff erences in other European Member States would be advisable before specifi c policies were developed. Importantly, this study has shown that discrimination and marginalisation are not restricted to Muslim youths and that, crucially, religious affi liation is less important in determining young people\u2019s involvement in violent behaviour than their peer group characteristics and their broader attitudes and experiences. However, the reasons underlying young Muslim\u2019s experiences of discrimination, marginalisation and violence may be diff erent to those of non-Muslims and this needs to be addressed in any policy response. The scope of this report builds on several previous studies of the Agency. A further development in this area is the linkage with the indicators on the rights of the child, elaborated by the FRA. Future research by the Agency will draw on the methodology and fi ndings of this report, where applicable, to advance the development of indicators by the Agency in the fi eld of fundamental rights \u2013 including areas such as social marginalisation and violence as they relate to non- discrimination and integration.

        "APPENDIX I: Technical details of study design and sample 85 APPENDIX I: Technical details of study design and sample Sampling strategies France In France, there are strict legislative restrictions on the collection of data (either through the offi cial census or through research studies) on the ethnicity and religion of individuals residing in the country. Therefore, it was not possible to base the sampling strategy on offi cial data about Muslim populations within specifi c geographic locations. Instead, local knowledge based on previous research was used to select areas with higher concentrations of minority ethnic residents. Bordeaux was selected because it contains several neighbourhoods with a particularly high concentration of Muslim households. Within Bordeaux, two specifi c areas were selected: one of which was a socially deprived neighbourhood with high concentration of ethnic minorities; the other was a satellite city with a vocational school where there were known to have been problems with racism during the previous academic year. The suburbs of Paris were chosen partly because of the high level of interest in the high profi le clashes between minority ethnic groups and the police in recent years; however, the authorities have also become concerned there by the growing recruitment of young people into traditional fundamentalist Muslim groups. One particular area was selected because if its reputation for having social and educational challenges and a high concentration of minority ethnic youths. The vocational and upper secondary schools were selected on the basis of the social and ethnic composition of their intake. Spain In Spain, it was not possible to construct a sampling design that was based on known concentrations of Muslim households because census data and offi cial statistics in Spain do not contain this information, either for individuals or collectively for administrative areas (Spanish Home Offi ce 2006). 35 The only available information relates to the nationality of foreign residents. Demographic information on foreign residents in Madrid and Granada was drawn from three sources: a Granada Council study of ethnic minorities\u2019 perceptions; from offi cial immigrant advisors in Granada and Madrid; and from TEIM at the Autonomous University of Madrid 36 . 35 The same sampling problem was encountered in a research study looking at public opinion of Muslim populations carried out by Metroscopia for the Spanish Home Offi ce in 2006. 36 TEIM is a research group about social development and intervention in the Mediterranean land, and specifi cally about Arabic issues. It is an organization dependent on the Department of Arabic and Islamic studies of the Autonomous University of Madrid. Neighbourhoods with high rates of minority ethnic groups from Muslim countries were identifi ed and then schools located in these areas. Originally, it was intended to survey around 4 schools in each location. However, this fi gure had to be revised because the proportion of children from Muslim backgrounds attending schools was severely limited. This was partly due to the small numbers of Muslim households with school children of the relevant ages living in the communities, but also due to legislation introduced by the Spanish government to limit the intake of minority ethnic youths in Spanish schools to 20%. As a consequence, a much larger number of schools had to be sampled (21 in total) and fi eldwork was widened out to include other organizations, such as centres for immigrant children, mosques and Arab language schools. The United Kingdom The United Kingdom Census questionnaire includes a question on individual religion; however, for reasons of confi dentiality, this information is not routinely published and was not available to the research team. Therefore, information on \u2018ethnic group\u2019 was used as a proxy measure for religious affi liation. The ethnic group of the Head of the Household (or household reference person) is routinely published at administrative Ward level. Using the 2001 Census, the administrative Wards with the highest concentrations of households with dependent children that had a Head of Household belonging to Pakistani or South Asian origin were identifi ed. Having identifi ed the most important Wards, the next stage was to identify the school catchment areas overlapping these Census Wards in order to sample from schools within these areas. The aim was to sample a total of around eight schools and four colleges from in and around these areas, selecting those schools and colleges that were known to have a good mix of both Muslim and non-Muslim young people attending. It was not possible simply to select those schools from within the identifi ed wards, as these did not always refl ect the population density of the local area. This was due to issues of parental choice, school admission policies and the proximity of schools within and across wards. In many areas of the United Kingdom, pupils do not attend their closest school but travel to other neighbouring areas for their education. In the selected location in London, this had led to signifi cant problems of school segregation, making it very diffi cult to fi nd schools with an \u2018even\u2019 balance of Muslim and non-Muslim youths. In Glasgow and Edinburgh, there were also some issues with parental choice (i. e. parents deciding to send their children to non-catchment schools). However, because Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 86 the concentration of Muslim households is not nearly so great in Scottish cities, a bigger problem for sampling was fi nding schools with a high enough density of Muslim pupils. For this reason, advice was sought from the local education authorities in both England and Scotland as to the most appropriate schools to sample (the aim being purposive rather than random sampling). Within each school, one class from each year group that covered the ages 12 to 18 was randomly sampled. In Scotland, this was fi rst to sixth year of secondary school; whereas, in England this was years seven to twelve. In order to ensure a large enough sample of 18 year olds (who were severely under-represented in the school samples) 2 colleges in Scotland and 2 sixth form colleges in England were visited and young people meeting the criteria in terms of age, sex and religious background were randomly selected to participate. Questionnaire administration Questionnaire administration started with a comprehensive introduction to the survey. The young people were informed about the nature, aims, background and confi dentiality of the study, and some time was spent explaining how to complete the questionnaire (e. g. reading instructions, following routing, etc). Participants were reassured that they would be completely anonymous, but given the opportunity to withdraw if they wished, even though their parents had consented. Thereafter, the survey was administered and the young people completed the questionnaires in exam type conditions. The average length of time for completion varied depending on the age, educational level and fi rst language of the respondents, but response time ranged from 15 to 55 minutes. Researchers were available at all times to answer questions or assist respondents and, for those who had more diffi culty completing the survey, one to one assistance was off ered. Once questionnaires were completed, they were checked briefl y (to ensure the minimum possible amount of missing data) and then gathered in by the researchers. Young people who completed the survey were given additional, fun tasks to complete during the course of fi eldwork in order not to disturb or distract those who were still fi lling in their questionnaire. Immediately following fi eldwork, the questionnaires were coded for identifi cation purposes (i.e. given unique reference numbers and codes for location, school/college type and year group) and then the data were input into computer software for analysis. Challenges of fi eldwork The research team faced a number of challenges in conducting this research. The nature of the research design is such that the fi ndings cannot be said to be generalisable to the whole population of the individual Member States, far less other Member States. However, it is hoped that the fi ndings are refl ective of the experiences, attitudes and behaviours of young people from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds living in areas of high ethnic diversity. During the course of the study, the research team faced some fairly diffi cult challenges which may have impacted in some ways on the fi ndings presented in this report. The main challenges are summarised below: In each of the three Member States, schools were sometimes reluctant to participate in the research because of the high demand for such research and the great burden placed on school staff and pupils by researchers. The access and ethical requirements for this study are outlined above; however, it is worth restating here the importance to schools, parents and students of guaranteeing anonymity and confi dentiality as this was raised many times during this survey. One hour was requested to administer our survey, although it was not always possible to provide this amount of time. Therefore, there were problems with getting some young people to fully complete the questionnaire. The concentration of Muslim youths within Member States is variable and it is often hard to pinpoint households with young people of the relevant ages, so fi nding schools with a high enough number of respondents was problematic. Educational policies that limit numbers of minority ethnic pupils (for example, in Spain) compound this problem. The fi eldwork for this study coincided with two periods of the Muslim holiday Eid, so it was necessary to make return visits to schools or colleges to ensure a high enough sample of Muslim youths was achieved. Achieved samples and data weighting The requirement of this study was to achieve a minimum sample of 1000 young people, with equal numbers of males and females, aged between 12 and 18, from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds. Despite all the challenges faced by the research team, the minimum achieved number of 1000 respondents was met in all three Member States. Table I.2. 1, below, presents a summary of the number of schools and other institutions that were visited for this study, and the number of young people that were surveyed during fi eldwork. In France eight schools were visited, including 2 vocational schools. The United Kingdom research also involved eight schools, but fi eldwork in four colleges was necessary to boost the number of 18 year olds. In Spain, signifi cant over-sampling was required in order to achieve a large enough number of Muslim respondents. Final version - 27 Oct 2010 launch ",
        "APPENDIX I: Technical details of study design and sample 87 Around three quarters of the fi eldwork was conducted in schools, with the remaining work taking place in various centres, mosques and community groups in order to boost the number of Muslim respondents. A minimum of 1000 respondents was surveyed in each member state, as shown in Table I.1. However, these fi gures had to be adjusted for two main reasons. Firstly, the over-sampling carried out in Spain and the United Kingdom caused signifi cant imbalance in the achieved sample sizes. In order to ensure that each of the Member States had approximately 1000 cases for analysis, it was decided to exclude some respondents from non-Muslim backgrounds from the Spanish and United Kingdom samples by randomly selecting a proportion of cases. This resulted in an adjusted sample of 1010 for Spain and 1029 for the United Kingdom. Second, in order to meet the objectives of the research, it was also necessary to ensure that the samples were equally distributed with regards to religious profi le, sex and age. Unfortunately, 52 cases from the French sample had to be excluded from analysis as there was no information about their cultural background. In addition, two French cases and one Spanish case had to be excluded because there was no information about the sex of the respondent. The fi nal adjusted sample sizes were 952 for France, 1009 for Spain and 1029 for the United Kingdom. Religious profi le Table I.2 shows the religious profi le of the adjusted samples in each member state. Those who reported that their religion was \u2018Islam\u2019 form the Muslim sample, while those from any other religious or non-religious background form the non-Muslim sample. Despite over-sampling, it was not possible to achieve a high enough number of Muslim respondents to form 50% of the sample in any one member state. The highest was 40% in Spain, with slightly less (36%) in France and the United Kingdom. Since a principal aim of this study was to compare Muslim respondents against those who did not follow Islam, the subsequent analysis in this report is broken down only by these two categories. However, it is important to note that the composition of the non-Muslim respondents in each of the three Member States is somewhat diff erent. For example, the proportion of Roman Catholic respondents in Spain (39%) and France (24%) is signifi cantly higher than it is in the United Kingdom (5%). In addition, the proportion of those young people who declared that they did not belong to any religion was high in both the United Kingdom (34%) and France (28%) compared to Spain (16%). These diff erences, while refl ective of the populations within the schools and colleges we sampled, may have some impact on the comparability of results across the Member States. Sex and age profi le Ideally, each of the samples should have had 50% males and 50% females. However, Table I.3 shows that the French and Spanish samples contained more female students (54%) than males; whereas the United Kingdom sample included fewer females (44%) than males. This was merely a refl ection of the school age populations in the sampled areas, and does not indicate any particular sampling bias. However, it was important to address this imbalance for the purposes of comparison.

        "Experience of discrimination, social marginalisation and violence : a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in three EU Member States 88 The age profi les for the three Member States are also somewhat diff erent, as shown in Table I.4, largely due to diff erences in the school systems which prevented equal numbers of each age bracket being sampled, particularly in France and the United Kingdom. The earliest school grades sampled contained some pupils aged 11; while, in the highest grades (in France) and in colleges (in the United Kingdom) some of the students were aged over 18. However, the majority of respondents (84% in France, 92% in the United Kingdom and 100% in Spain) fell within the 12-18 year age range. Thus, the samples include some youths up to age 12 at the lower end and some youths over 18 at the upper end. Ideally, each year of age should have been represented by approximately 14% of the sample within each Member State. Table I.4, however, shows that there is some degree of bias in the achieved samples, with the older respondents (aged 18 or over) being signifi cantly over-represented in the French sample and under-represented in the United Kingdom and Spanish samples. This over-representation in France was caused by a larger proportion of students being achieved in the vocational schools, which had an older age range; whereas, the under-representation in Spain and the United Kingdom was due to diffi culties in accessing young people who were either involved in fi nal examinations at the time of the survey or who had already left secondary education. The French sample also under-represents those respondents aged 15 or less, largely as a consequence of the over- representation of the older age groups. Whereas, the United Kingdom sample signifi cantly over-represents the very youngest respondents (aged 12 or under), because these some of the schools sampled were only able to make available students in the lowest years. Overall, the average age of the respondents was very similar in the United Kingdom (14.5 years) and Spanish samples (14.7 years); however, the French sample was signifi cantly older at 15.7 years on average. Data weighting The research design required a selected sample of 1000 respondents, with equal numbers of males and females from age 12 to 18, from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds. The analysis described above shows that there were some diff erences in sample size (even after achieved samples had been adjusted) and there was some bias in terms of age, sex and religious background in all three Member States. Since the analysis presented in this report is intended to refl ect the diff erences between the three Member States according to the selected samples, the data have been weighted to refl ect equal sample sizes (of 1000) and an equal balance across sex and age groups. In order to prevent creating weights that are too large, the samples have been weighted to refl ect 40% Muslim and 60% non-Muslim respondents in each member state. Since most of the analysis presented in this report provides a comparison of respondents within Muslim or non-Muslim groups, this does not present a problem for comparison.

This research shows a high degree of overlap between three EU Member States when considering explanatory factors to violent attitudes or acts of violence committed by young people. The main factors that can be associated with violent behaviour are being male, being part of a delinquent youth group/gang, being discriminated against, and being socially marginalised \u2013 when these aspects are taken into consideration, religious background and/or affi liation plays no part in explaining violent behaviour. Its fi ndings are based on a survey, carried out by the FRA in \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf64b-\uf645\uf643\uf643\uf64c, of \uf646,\uf643\uf643\uf643 children aged \uf644\uf645-\uf644\uf64b years in France, Spain and the United Kingdom \u2013 three Member States that have all experienced terrorist attacks associated with radical Islam or urban unrest related to immigrant youth with a predominantly Muslim background.
