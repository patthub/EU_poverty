Read about the next steps in the press release of the Portuguese presidency of the Council. Spotlight on the rights of the child The European Commission recently released the new EU strategy on the rights of the child. This is a milestone communication, as not only does it draw upon contributions from the European Parliament, the Council, Member States, child rights organisations and other stakeholders, but it has also been developed together with children. Indeed, the views and suggestions of over 10 000 children have been taken on board in preparing it. This marks an important step for the EU towards genuine child inclusion in its decision-making processes. The communication reminds us that children risk being among the biggest victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence shows that during its course, children have been exposed to increased domestic violence and online abuse. There have been delays in procedures such as those for asylum or family reunification. The shift to distance learning has disproportionately affected very young children, those with special needs, those living in poverty, those in marginalised communities and in remote and rural areas lacking access to internet connections and IT equipment. Many children have lost their most nutritious daily meal, as well as access to services that schools provide. The COVID-19 pandemic has also strongly affected children\u2019s mental health, with a reported increase in anxiety, stress and loneliness. All this indicates that coordinated action is needed. The new strategy addresses six key areas: child participation in political and democratic life; socioeconomic inclusion, health and education; combating violence against children and ensuring child protection; child-friendly justice; digital and information society; and the global dimension. In its goals, it is supplemented with the Parliament and Council recommendation establishing the European Child Guarantee. This aims at breaking the cycle of poverty and social exclusion across generations, and engages the Member States in providing support to children in need. The May edition of our newsletter features publications related to the rights of the child and several other interesting topics. ",
