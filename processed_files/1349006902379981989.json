        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News Preliminary draft budget COMMISSIONER Peter Schmidhuber presented a preliminary draft budget for 1993 of 67.3bn ECU (\u00a347bn) in commitments and 64.3bn V\u00c12V (\u00a345bn) in payments which amounts to an increase of 2.05% over the 1992 figure and corresponds to 1.1% of Community (\u00ceNP. MEPs particularly welcomed the Commission's decision to include 1.565bn KCL for the 'Cohesion' Fund agreed at Maastricht to support transport and environment spending in the four poorest member states, Greece,' Ireland, Spain and Portugal, and a further 28bn ECU for the regions. Farm spending is set to fall to less than 50 per cent of the total and remain 4.5bn KCU below the guidelines, but this, he warned, could change as it is mainly due to the favourable exchange rate anticipated between the ECU and the dollar, which depresses anticipated agricultural expenditure. The preliminary draft will now go to Council which can be expected to agree a draft budget under the British Presidency in July. That draft will then come to Parliament, which will consider it after the summer break. nil \u25a0 / \u25a0 P 1^ * \\ w % ' ,$',36 A\u00c6'\u00ab* ; l S' \u00ae'*\u2122S\u00ed. . ~ ?m . \u25a0 \u00aba n jr ^ \u25a0\"\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0' - \"' \u00bf w 'mv ti 5 \u00ef FORESTERS' CAP PLEA \u2022 A group of foresters from Scotland, pictured above with MEP Winnie Ewing, came to Strasbourg to make a plea for more attention to be paid to forestry in the CAP reforms. All clear for working abroad A NEW EC law designed to allow more professional qualifications to be accepted throughout the Twelve is set to conic into force alter Council's draft agreement was approved by Parliament this week. It applies to intermediate pro\u00ad fessions such as social and den\u00ad tal workers where qualifications were obtained after one year's full\u00adtime study or the equivalent period part\u00adtime, and entry re\u00ad quirements which are similar to those for university and higher education, i.e. 'A' levels. The countries accepting each others' national qualifications will, however, be allowed to im\u00ad pose an aptitude test or an adap\u00ad tion period of three years. The agreement follows on from an earlier directive equating qualifications based on three years study and will apply to levels 3 and 4 of the National Foundation for Vocational Train\u00ad ing programmes. Parliament rejects sweeteners plan... PARLIAMENT used its powers acquired under the Single European Act to reject a Council common position on permitted sweeteners in food and drinks. Immediately after the vote the Commission announced that the proposal would be withdrawn and it can not now come into force in its present form. The rejection vote was recommended by environment committee chairman Ken Collins (Strathclydc East, Soc) and Caroline Jackson (Kent East, EPP), who explained that Council had introduced a footnote to the text approved by Parliament at first reading, which would effectively ban sweeteners used in low alcoholic beers for sale in Germany on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve traditional processes. Mrs Jackson doubted whether this was in fact the case as low alcoholic beer hardly counted as a German tradition. She then made a passionate plea for support, especially as Council had used the device of a footnote to alter the text without having to rcconsult Parliament. With 260 votes needed, sufficient MEPs were impressed by her arguments and the final vote was 286 to 58 with 7 abstentions. This is Pest birds beware as law changes PARLIAMENT has backed a proposed change to 1979 EC legisla\u00ad tion on the protection of wild birds, which will make it easier for farmers and others to hunt live species which are regarded by some people as pest birds \u2014 the jay, magpie, jackdaw, rook and crow. Hunting, however, will still be banned during the breeding season, an unsatisfactory situation as far as farming and sporting interests are concerned. They have argued for all year round con\u00ad trols because of the damage caused by these 'pests' to crops and other birds. The change has not been opposed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds but, along with Parliament, it wants the existing directive amended to ban the hunting of certain species under threat, including the brent goose, the garganey, the quail and the coot. A number of organisations are also against the hunting of the jay in Northern Ireland, where it is rare. only the second time that a common position has been rejected and the Commission will have to start the whole process again by submitting a new proposal if legislation is to reach the statute book. Farm prices VOTING on the 1992\u00ad93 farm price proposals, MEPs demanded a genuine roll\u00adover of last year's prices, basically along the lines proposed by the farm committee. Parliament also made an urgent plea to the EC farm ministers to decide on the CAP reform package by 1 June. 1992. It now also falls to the farm ministers to decide on prices. On cereals, Parliament voted to reduce the co\u00adresponsibility levy of 5% to 3.5% and to halve the proposed additional levy on production to 1.5%. Parliament also wants to see a temporary aid scheme to encourage less intensive farming and help to off\u00ad set the costs of set\u00adaside. In the beef sector. Parliament voted to retain the cow suckler premium at 50 ECU, the same as last year. The Commission had proposed to reduce it to 40 ECU. Parliament also backed a special premium of 50 ECU for fattening beef cattle, limited to 90 animals per farmer. As far as milk is concerned, MEPs voted to abolish the co\u00ad responsibility levy forthwith and not await the outcome of CAP reform. In order to compensate for possible losses arising from the dismantling of the system of monetary compensatory amounts, Parliament believes a system of national aid, similar to that which already exists in Germany, should be introduced.

In the stratosphere, ozone is a vital shield against damaging ultra\u00adviolet rays from the sun, hence the growing alarm about 'holes' in the ozone layer. But at ground level, ozone is a harmful pollutant, irritating lungs and eyes and causing damage to buildings. Ozone pollution is another consequence of increasing road traffic, caused by photochemical reactions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons emitted by vehicle exhausts. According to the Commission, the ozone levels now recorded in Europe are regularly above the values thought to be safe for health and the environ\u00ad ment. In a separate vote MEPs approved the accession of the European Community to the 1988 Sofia protocol which seeks to stabilise nitrogen oxide emissions by 1994, although environment committee spokesman Paul Lannoye (B, Greens) would like the Community to go further and adopt stricter limits. NEWS IN BRIEF EMU: progress to be monitored A NEW sub\u00adcommittee of the economic and monetary affairs committee has been formed to monitor progress towards economic and monetary union and the rules applying to the European Central Bank. Under the Maastricht treaty Parliament will have a key role to play in the 'multilateral surveillance' period, during which the member states will take measures, such as reducing national deficits, in order to bring economies into line, and Parliament's approval of the setting up of the Central Bank is also required under the Assent procedure. The new Governor of the Bank will report to the economic and monetary affairs committee. The new 14\u00adstrong sub\u00adcommittee will be chaired by Christa Randzio\u00adPlath (G, Soc) and other members include Alan Donnelly (Tyne and Wear, Soc) and Ben Patterson (Kent West, EPP). Pat Cox (Munster, LDR), Barry Desmond (Dublin, Soc), Paddy Lalor (Leinster EDA), and John Cushnahan (Munster EPP), are substitute members. 'No' to industrial research help RESEARCH Ministers holding preliminary discussions on the 4th Research Framework Programme in April, gave the thumbs down to th\u00e9 Commission's plans for more of the increased research budget to go towards funding specific sectors like the motor industry or aeronautics, which Ministers believe are best supported by the private sector. Instead Ministers issued a declaration calling for an in\u00addepth evaluation of previous EC research programmes and committed themselves to supporting basic research. Council will return to the question with a view to agreeing priorities with both the Commission and Parliament by October, 1992. Better maternity benefits on way WOMEN in Britain can expect improved maternity benefits following Parliament's approval of a Council common position, ensuring 14 weeks' leave, with payments equivalent to national sick pay rates. UK rules at present provide for six weeks leave on 90% of full pay followed by a minimum rate for another 12 weeks, while in Ireland it is 14 weeks on 70% pay with both countries some way behind Denmark, where expectant working mothers can look forward to 28 weeks leave on 90% pay. MEPs voted for more generous arrangements but these are unlikely to be accepted by Council. Queen meets ex\u00ad guardsman David DURING her visit to Strasbourg, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II met David Sweeney, who works for the European Parliament. A former member of the Grenadier Guards Regiment, of which Her Majesty is Colonel\u00adin\u00adChief, Mr Sweeney has been awarded the British Empire Medal and thus the Palace felt it appropriate that both Mr Sweeney and his wife Elizabeth, who works for MEP David Martin, (Lothians, Soc) should be presented to Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh. This introduction took place just prior to the Queen's address to the MEPs and the Duke of Edinburgh was interested to hear how an ex\u00ad grenadier found life in the European Parliament. European Parliament May 11-15, 1992 AX-AD-92-5-EN-C ISSIM-0250-5754 - EP NEWS (UK Edition) The week in Strasbourg EPNEWS \u2022 The first visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the European Parliament was the highlight of this week in Strasbourg and was warmly welcomed by MEPs. \u2022 The House was united in supporting the need for high profile campaigns to combat drug trafficking but came down against the legalisation of the possession of drugs. \u2022 The problems of the developing world were taken up with MEPs calling for a new partnership and Parliament flexed its muscles using its single act powers to reject a Council common position on sweeteners after the Commission refused to bend. \u2022 The deteriorating situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina continued to give cause for concern and MEPs once again appealed to farm ministers to reach agreement on prices and CAP reform. The Queen welcomes European democracy 'in this ever more important Parliament of Europe ' \u2022 The Queen delivers her historic speech QUEEN Elizabeth II came to Strasbourg to pay tribute to the European Parliament for its role in furthering the cause of peace in Europe and its contribution to European democracy. MEPs and indeed all Europeans could be proud of what had been achieved \"in this ever more important Parliament of Europe\", she said. It was the Queen's first speech to the European Parliament and Her Majesty began by recalling Winston Churchill's reference to 'the tragedy of Europe' when he contrasted the continent's achievements in culture, arts and science with a \"succession of self destructive conflicts which has beset our continent\". He sought \"to recreate the European family and provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom\", she said. The European family, she said, contained diverse personalities but like any family there was a need for \"tolerance and mutual support\". This was recognised by Europe's founding fathers who wanted to draw strength from that diver\u00ad sity and \"to bind nations and peoples together in a common endeavour as free partners\". Meanwhile, Strasbourg, she add\u00ad ed, symbolised \"reconciliation between France and Germany which in itself the founding fathers saw as the precondition for a wider European peace\". But her words did not pass without controversy and although welcomed by MEPs from all around the House and indeed greeted with a standing ovation, became the focus of attention in Westminster on account of a sum\u00ad mary of her speech released before delivery which was interpreted in some quarters as implying an ac\u00ad ceptance of loss of sovereignty by national parliaments. Her actual words were: \"Standing here today, I am conscious of the differences in na\u00ad tional Parliamentary traditions across the Community. Tlie British members will no doubt have brought to the deliberations of this House the vigorous tone of Westminster debate: a style which can be confrontational, as some of my ancestors found! But, dif\u00ad ferences of style and opinion are insignificant against the back\u00ad ground of the proven commitment of Europeans today to reconcilia\u00ad tion and democracy. ' 'Far better the tough talking and controversy of genuine debate, for which this Parliament is a forum, than drab uniformity. By your deliberations and well con\u00ad tested decisions you reinforce the work of national parliaments. I welcome your contribution to European democracy\". She then quoted from Jean Monnet, described in one French newspaper 'dans un fran\u00e7ais impeccable' and referred to the early successes of the European Coal and Steel Community. Europe's strength, she said, was its diversity with decisions taken \"as close to the citizen as is NO TO DRUGS LEGALISATION The House voted 171 to 135 with eight abstentions in favour of a resolution which firmly opposes the legalisation of drugs as an approach to tackling the problem of drug trafficking. The vote in the full House came about in response to concern by MEPS that the majority view in the special committee of enquiry in favour of decriminalising the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use, could be perceived as the viewpoint of the whole Parliament. See report page 2 \u2022 Parliament's President Egon Klepsch presents the Queen with Parliament's gold medal. The President thanked Her Majesty for her address and the importance she attached to European integration which he described as an encouragement to us all. compatible with their success\". At the same time there was a need to strengthen the ability of Europeans to \"act on a European basis where the nature of problems requires a European response\". That, she said, \"was the necessary balance struck at Maastricht\". Yet, German unification, the demise of dictatorship in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Berlin Wall were, she felt, en\u00ad couraging signs. The Communi\u00ad ty through its own experience was an example of what could be achieved and was indeed engaged in reinforcing political and economic changes throughout Europe. \"I am sure that it must do more, I am confident that it will\", she said. The newly emerging demo\u00ad cracies increasingly looked towards the Community, Her Majesty said, adding \"we must not let them down\". She closed with a quotation from Lord Salisbury dating back to 1888, \"we are part Of the Community of Europe and we must do our duty as such\". Disappointment on carbon tax stand MEPs expressed their dis\u00ad appointment at the Commis\u00ad sion's proposal to link an EC energy tax to similar measures taken by the Community's inter\u00ad national partners, especially the USA. \"It hands responsibility for EC environmental policy to the US President, said environ\u00ad ment committee chairman Ken Collins (Strathclyde East, Soc) who was highly critical of the preparations for Rio. \"What has been agreed on C0 2 , is a timetable without a target and a target without a timetable\", he said. Instead of an occasion for getting a rescue plan for the planet, it was a miss\u00ad ed opportunity sacrificed on the altar of electoral opportunity and short\u00adterm economic growth, he felt. Madron Seligman (Sussex West, EPP) welcomed the Com\u00ad mission's proposal for a carbon tax aimed at stabilising emis\u00ad sions by the year 2000, but warn\u00ad ed that action must be world\u00adwide for it to be effective. As the Community only ac\u00ad counted for 13 % of total emis\u00ad sions, he said, it would be futile to go it alone. The support of the USA, Japan, China and Eastern Europe was essential. The environment Commis\u00ad sioner, Mr Ripa di Meana felt that EC action would be an im\u00ad portant lever for putting pressure on the United States. \u2022 The Queen relaxes with MEPs Caroline Jackson and Vice-President David Martin.

European Parliament International action is EP News European Parliament \u2014 EP News key to problem THIS month MEPs turned the spotlight on the drugs trade when they considered the findings of a special committee of inquiry into links between organised crime and drug trafficking, a trade estimated to be worth at least 120 billion US dollars world wide a year. The prospect of the removal of internal EC border checks from next year, the opening up of Eastern Europe after the collapse of Communism, the targeting of Western Europe by the drug cartels and the growth in drug related crime prompted Parliament to set up the special inquiry, under the chairmanship of David Bowe (Cleveland and Yorkshire North, Soc), who said the committee was the first official body to study the problems Europe-wide. Drawing on the evidence of over 30 key witnesses, including police and customs officers and submissions from various member states, the findings of the 56-page report compiled by Pat Cooney (Leinster, EPP) paint a sombre picture. It highlights the financial might and the increasing influence, sometimes political, which is exercised by drug dealers from the Mafia to backstreet operations in Poland making amphetamines and other synthetic or 'designer' drugs. It concludes that better international cooperation is essential if the war on drugs is to be waged more successfully. The report notes that drug related crimes account for more than half of all police arrests across the EC and reveals a dramatic increase in drug seizures in recent years. Over twelve tonnes of cocaine were seized in 1990, a two-fold increase over 1989. The seizures of heroin jumped from nearly 1400 kilograms in 1982 to over 6000 kilograms in 1990. But it is feared that this may only be the tip of the iceberg with perhaps less than 10% of the traffic in drugs being intercepted. In March this year the Belgian authorities uncovered 650 kilograms of cocaine, the largest haul ever in Belgium, in a container ship from Panama. In the same week customs officials on Merseyside in England seized 900 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 Another major drugs seizure gets the attention of the media. Declaring war on the drugs trade \u2022 Sir Jack Stewart Clark (pictured left), with key members of East Sussex Drug Advisory Council (ESDAC), an organisation coordinating local authorities, public and private services, local schools and drug agencies in activities to combat drug abuse in East Sussex. Parliament endorsed his report which calls for more public awareness on the dangers of drug addiction. valued at over \u00a3150 million \u2014 shipped from Venezuela. Two months earlier 800 kilograms of cocaine were seized by the Dutch authorities in Rotterdam. Such seizures underline repeated warnings from police and customs authorities that drug traffickers are targeting Western Europe as an alternative to the United States market, which has become saturated. In his report, Pat Cooney fears that the drug barons in many cases have strengthened their European organisations in the last three years in the anticipation of a Europe with fewer border controls and to avail of new drug routes presented by the opening up of Eastern Europe. The removal of customs controls in line with the creation of the single market will clearly weaken the ability of member states to fight drug trafficking unless something is done to compensate, warns the committee. Better information and improved cooperation between EC countries is essential, spearheaded by the creation of a European Drugs Intelligence Unit, staffed by police and customs officers from each member state. The committee also favours the retention of spot checks against drugs after internal borders are abolished. The main recommendations Among the committee's recommendations are: \u2014 a major public information campaign to reduce demand \u2014 more help for users including registered clinics for heroin addicts and the issue of syringes \u2014 all EC states to ratify and implement UN Conventions on Drugs \u2014 the establishment of a European Drugs Intelligence Unit, provided it is subject to democratic control \u2014 all EC states to sign the European Convention on Extradition in order to limit the number of safe havens reinforcement of member states' customs services a 'Charter of Transparency' for public and political life in order to combat corruption more EC help for governments in drug producing areas to clamp down on illegal drug production agreement between countries to facilitate the confiscation of proceeds derived from crime sanctions against tax havens suspected of dealing in money laundering. BOOKSHELF LABOUR VISIT Contenders for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party Margaret Beckett and John Prescott were in Strasbourg to put their respective cases and lobby for support. Under the rules for electing the party's leaders, MEPs have a vote and were eager to hear their respective approaches and, in particular, their attitude towards Europe. Leadership contenders, Bryan Gould, and John Smith are expected next month. 1. Changing Europe: Challenges Facing the Voluntary and Community Sectors in the 1990s by Sean Baine, John Benington and Jill Russell. ISBN 0 7199 1328 4 Price \u00a37.95 2. Networking in Europe: A Guide to European Voluntary Organisations by Brian Harvey. ISBN 0 7199 1338 1. Price \u00a310.95 These two publications provide a mass of useful information to organisations, council authorities, academics and students seeking a quick and easy guide to European integration and EC social policies affecting the voluntary sectors. The first book analyses the impact of the Single Market and its implications for communities and voluntary organisations in the context of forecasts for a dramatic rise in the elderly population, Another priority for the committee is to stop the drug barons from diverting their ill- gotten gains to legitimate purposes. It is estimated that 80% of the earnings from the drugs trade \u2014 nearly 100 billion dollars a year \u2014 are laundered through banks and other financial bodies and then invested on the world capital markets. New EC rules to clamp down on money laundering, which are due to come into effect from January 1993, must be strictly applied and monitored, stresses the committee. Tighter controls on banks are also recommended. Above all else, the committee concludes that the main priority for action should be to undermine the demand for drugs. It advocates a sustained and comprehensive information campaign to reduce demand, aimed particularly at schools. More help for addicts and moves to facilitate easier access to treatment are among other suggestions. According to one estimate, there are between 1.5 and two million addicts in the Community. But there was less agreement in the committee over the controversial question of legalising drugs. As existing policies have not managed to stop, or even reduce, the spread of drugs into the EC, the majority comprising Socialist, Green and EUL MEPs felt that new policies and approaches should not be ruled out. Possession of illicit drugs in small quantities for personal use should not be a criminal offence was the majority view. There was less controversy, however, over plans for a European Drugs Monitoring Centre which was given the go- ahead by Parliament. Its task will be to collate and distribute information on the drugs problem which would serve as a basis for framing more effective anti-drug policies. The member states should be in a position to approve the proposal this June, although it remains to be seen if they can agree on where to locate the new body, having failed for the last two years to decide on a site for the European Environment Agency. while the second provides an exhaustive guide to the mush rooming body of organisations operating at a European level.

Plea to help the Third World Call for a new start DURING Christian Aid Week Parliament made a special plea for a massive shift in resources to help the Third World, after endorsing twelve reports from the development committee which highlight the plight of millions of people living in Africa and Latin America who risk being forgotten as the European Community concen trates on adapting to the new situation in Eastern Europe and forges ahead with its own plans for European Union, a single currency and indeed helping the Community's poorer regions. But, MEPs believe the changing world order, follow ing the collapse of communism, offer a unique opportunity to start a new partnership with the Third World in which the European Community can play a key role. For example, a mere 10% reduction in arms spending by the industrialised countries would enable Third World aid to be doubled at a stroke. Yet, at present, not all EC countries meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP. For example, Britain only manag ed 0.27% in 1990 while the figure for Ireland was 0.16%. In fact a new study by Chris tian Aid claims that in 1990 developing countries paid the UK \u00a32.4bn more in debt repayments than they received in new loans, investment and aid although these figures are disputed by the govern ment. Yet, before a new start can be made, there is a pressing need to tackle the problem of Third World debt which at the end of 1990 totalled $l,450bn with annual servicing costs at $162bn. A start was made in 1991 when the international financial com munity agreed to cancel between half and three quarters of the debts run up by Nicaragua and Benin. Parliament wants the Community and the member states to take the lead by cancelling the debts of all ACP states in exchange for a com mitment on the part of developing countries themselves to take steps to protect the environment. Other wise Parliament wants to see: \u2022 A mother, with child, use a well in Zimbabwe. EP NEWS SPECIAL REPORT Food production and food aid a special UN conference to secure a new worldwide agree ment for a substantial increase in Commodity prices the removal of protectionist restrictions under the GATT trade negotiations, which at present affect $55bn of exports from the Third World A new UN backed Court of Appeal to deal with complaints about international treaty violations Development policy to be an essential feature of EC foreign policy with aid and develop ment given a higher profile by Council and the Commission and improved decision making procedures to enable EC aid to reach its destination more quickly Third World governments to reduce arms spending respect for human rights link ed to aid programmes economic reform, more private investment and the introduc tion of long term development programmes based on sus tainable growth. A PERMANENT solution to the problem of the lack of food shortages in the developing countries can only be achieved by enabling countries or regions, suffering from regular shortages, to become self-sufficient. This, believes Terry Wynn (Merseyside East, Soc), should be the Community's approach in alleviating world hunger rather than improving existing EC food aid programmes, which are costly, especially in terms of transport, and have been subject to criticisms in respect of unnecessary delays and food not reaching its intended destination. Mr Wynn reminded the House that Council last year took eight months to take a decision in response to the famine in the Horn of Africa. Emergency aid to deal with tragedies such as the present drought in Africa will obviously need to be continued, but a longer term strategy should be based on agricultural reform, to benefit small scale producers, with in centives to improve yields through access to finance and basic infrastructure, such as irrigation and roads. This needs to be coupled with efficient marketing and pricing with safeguards to dis courage the imports of subsidised farm products from abroad. Studies show that farmers in the Third World owning their own land are prepared to invest enormous amounts of time and energy in making it productive. But they need access to basic tools, seeds and help with irrigation and marketing. Their own governments should discourage imports of subsidised farm products from abroad. Parliament wants to see a reform of EC rules on food aid so that decisions can be taken more quickly, and the developing countries are not obliged to buy food on the Community's markets, looking instead to neighbouring countries for supplies. The scope of the regulation should also be widened to provide for the purchase of related non-food essentials such as tools and cooking fuel. European Democracy Fund IN order to strengthen democracy in countries developing closer links with the EC, Edward McMillan-Scott (York, EPP) has put forward the idea of 'A European Democracy Fund'. It would contribute towards civic education campaigns with an emphasis on basic democratic values such as the rule of law and respect for human rights in a multi-party system. Distribution of the funds would be along similar lines to the 17m ECU fund voted to promote democracy in Chile in 1985 but should respect the electoral laws of the countries concerned. Women and children bear the brunt of Third World poverty. Women should take increasing role \u2014 MEPs WOMEN and children bear the brunt of trying to survive in the least developed countries of the world with 130 million children under eleven never having been to school, and a further 150 million likely to die either from disease, malnutrition or exploitation. Some 10 million are likely to be infected with the HIV virus before the year 2000 while many women in developing countries are increasingly forced into prostitution. Women and children It is with this bleak situation in mind that MEPs want women themselves to play an increasing role in the democratic and economic structures of the countries con cerned, with more programmes concentrating on involving them in training programmes, especially for agriculture. Health and nutrition are two other areas where women can play a key role, with more emphasis on family planning, while Margaret Daly (Somerset and Dorset West, EPP) and Christopher Jackson (Kent East, EPP) underlined the importance of education and family planning programmes. Parliament also wants to see international action to stamp out child labour and the sexual exploitation of women. Charities and voluntary organisations Greater aid role for volunteers? CHARITIES and voluntary organisations such as the International Red Cross, Christian Aid, Oxfam and Trocaire play a major role in distributing food aid and helping with small scale projects. In 1990 such bodies were responsible for administering some 318m ECU of EC aid, while over the past 30 years some 100,000 European volunteers have worked in the developing countries under the auspices of one of the voluntary organisations. This is one area of development policy that can be considered a success story but MEPs are worried that without a substantial increase in the EC's aid budget, many worthwhile projects benefiting from co-financing will have to be cancelled. This is particularly regrettable, as the system of joint financing means that every ECU from the Community's budget is matched by the charities with one and a half ECU raised from other sources such as voluntary contributions. Michael McGowan (Leeds, Soc) emphasised the point that the voluntary organisations, with their own people on the ground, were often the best informed of the developing countries' needs. Parliament wants, therefore, more attention to be paid to the role of the voluntary organisations when the new aid budget is agreed. The Environment Their problems are the world's THE Third World is beset with environmental problems from deforestation to desertification, while climatic change brought about by the greenhouse effect, and the expected rise in water levels, will put at risk the lives of millions of people living in cities just above sea level. Population growth over the past 15 years has already led to the destruction of more than 100 million hectares of woodland to make way for extra housing, roads and farm land, while current forecasts project almost a doubling of the world's present population of 5.4bn to lObn by the year 2050, with 90 per cent of the increase in developing countries. Other problems faced by the Third World include the increasing use of pesticides, already banned in Europe, and dangerous waste exported from industrialised countries, not to mention increased urbanisation and with it the lack of clean water, adequate sewerage and facilities for waste disposal. Looking to the June Earth Summit on environment and development, MEPs believe that the South's environmental problems are also the world's problems and that the Third World's future economic development very much depends on action taken in the North as well as the South. For example, the GATT trade negotiations should include an environment clause while the Commission can help by taking action to encourage imports of sustainably produced goods through tariff preferences. Parliament would also like to see a ban after 1995, on the import of tropical hardwoods not produced through a sustainable growth programme, and another ban on the export of dangerous waste to third countries. Immigration, immigrant workers, students Protecting their rights IN A bid to ensure that the four million migrants and 50,000 students from the Third World living in the EC countries do not suffer from discrimination as the flow of immigration from Eastern Europe increases, Parliament has put forward a plan for a special legal statute for migrants' rights which would involve regularising the situation of illegal migrants throughout the Twelve. At the same time MEPs believe it is essential to tackle the causes of immigration i.e. human rights violations, hunger, poverty and illiteracy and encourage trained migrants to return to their countries of origin. EC training schemes can help and indeed some success has already been achieved under a Lom\u00e9 Convention backed programme whereby 7.3m ECU was spent on persuading professional people to return home. But more needs to be done to encourage rural development in the developing countries and stem the flow of people to the cities, which is the first step for migrants leaving countries where jobs are scarce. The impact of the single market . .. DESPITE fears by many developing countries that the single market programme will lead the Community to look inwards, MEPs take the view that on balance it should not have an adverse effect on the poorer countries in the world, although the Commission is requested to monitor trade flows closely. In fact other factors such as the GATT trade negotiations and a fall in private investment are more important for the countries concerned, although Third World countries are irritated by the protectionist nature of the CAP and its effect on international trade while the new higher EC standards emerging from the single market programme, which will apply to food imports as well as industrialised goods, are also giving cause for concern.
