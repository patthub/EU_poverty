        "Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2016 includes twenty-eight individual country reports. It builds on the most up-to-date quantitative and qualitative evidence to present and assess the main recent and ongoing policy measures in each EU Member State, with a focus on developments since mid-2015. It therefore complements the existing sources of informa- tion which offer descriptions of national education and training systems. The structure of the country reports is as follows. Section 1 presents a statistical overview of the main education and training indicators. Section 2 briefly identifies the main strengths and challenges of the country\u2019s education and training system. Section 3 looks at expenditure on education, and demographic and skill challenges. Section 4 focuses on early school leaving, early childhood education and care, and basic skills as important areas related to tackling inequalities and promoting inclu- sion. Section 5 deals with policies to modernise school education, covering, inter alia, the teaching profession and digital and language skills. Section 6 discusses measures to modernise higher education. Finally, section 7 covers vocational education and training, as well as adult learning.

        "2 MALTA Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 2. Highlights \uf0d8 Malta is investing heavily in its education and training system. \uf0d8 Recent positive measures on school education aim to modernise curricula, improve teaching quality and promote digital skills. \uf0d8 Transition from education to the labour market is easier than in most other EU countries. \uf0d8 Despite recent progress, the early school leaving rate remains the second highest in the EU and the tertiary educational attainment rate is still low. \uf0d8 Participation of low-skilled adults in lifelong learning is rather low. Box 1: The 2016 European Semester country-specific recommendation on education and training The 2016 European Semester country-specific recommendations (CSRs) to Malta (Council of the European Union 2016) included a recommendation on education and training: Take measures to strengthen labour supply, in particular through increased participation of low- skilled persons in lifelong learning. 3. Investing in education to address demographic and skill challenges General government expenditure on education, both as a proportion of GDP (5.8 % in 2014, see Figure 2) and as a proportion of total public expenditure (13.5 % in 2014), is well above the EU average (4.9 % and 10.2 %, respectively). 1 Employment rates are above the EU average at all qualification levels, but overall Malta\u2019s workforce remains relatively low-qualified. Despite recent improvements, Malta still has the highest proportion of low-qualified adults in the EU, as 56.5 % of population aged 25-64 has at most a level of education equivalent to lower secondary education (ISCED 0-2).

        "MALTA 3 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 4. Tackling inequalities and promoting inclusion The early school leaving rate has fallen significantly in recent years, from 27.2 % in 2008 to 19.8 % in 2015, but is still the second highest in the EU. It is also well above the ambitious Europe 2020 national target of 10 %. The gender gap (male rate minus female rate) is above the EU average, at 6.3 percentage points compared to the EU average of 2.9 percentage points. Participation in early childhood education for children aged four and five is universal, which may help prevent early school leaving in the long term. Available international studies show that basic skills attainment among young people is rather poor (European Commission 2015). However, the data are quite old, as Malta did not participate in the 2012 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), but only in the 2009 round. The publication of the PISA 2015 results in December 2016 will provide a more up-to-date picture of Malta \u2019 s performance compared to other countries. The proportion of non-Maltese pupils is increasing. According to data from the Ministry for Education and Employment, in 2014/2015, they made up 7.4 % of total pupils in primary schools and 4.9 % in secondary schools; 2 they came from around 70 different countries, the largest communities being from the UK, Italy, Libya and Bulgaria. The number of students who register for the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examination has increased, from 82.8 % of 16-year-olds in 2013 to 85.4 % in 2015. Similarly, the percentage of those who obtain a Malta qualifications framework (MQF) level 2 or 3 in at least five different subjects has increased from 72.2 % in 2013 to 78.9 % in 2015 (Matsec Examinations Board, various years). Through the Foundation College of the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST) a significant number of other students achieve a full MQF level 2 or 3 qualification in subsequent years after compulsory schooling. This enables them to continue into further and higher education programmes. A national study on early school leavers was published in December 2015 (National Observatory for Living with Dignity 2015). Its results show strong negative associations between early school leaving and many aspects of wellbeing. Early school leavers, regardless of their age, are less happy and less satisfied with their lives than their counterparts with higher educational attainment. They also feel socially excluded more frequently and experience greater health problems. A report on the implementation of the 2014 early school leaving strategy (Ministry for Education and Employment 2014b) was completed in early 2016. The Ministry for Education and Employment will revise the strategy by the end of 2016, including by removing measures that have already been completed and adding new ones focusing on new vulnerable groups. The \u2018 Alternative Learning Programme \u2019 (ALP) has been offered for the third consecutive year. It is aimed at students who are reaching the end of compulsory schooling, but who clearly demonstrate that they will not attain the desired qualification. This programme has a strong vocational component and students are expected to continue with their education or training in a full-time higher education institution or in other lifelong learning institutions on a part-time basis. Following implementation of the ALP, the programme\u2019s effectiveness in ensuring that students remain in the education and training system is currently being assessed. Besides the ALP programme, two other programmes are offered to students who at the end of compulsory education manage to acquire no or minimum qualifications, giving the opportunity of a \u2018second chance education\u2019. \u2018Youth Inc.\u2019 is an inclusive education programme based on applied learning offered by Malta\u2019s National Youth Agency to people between 16 and 21 years of age. It seeks to strengthen the complementary role of formal and non-formal learning, and to assist young person in gaining key competences and sectoral skills. The second programme offered is \u2018GEM16+\u2019, launched by the Ministry for Education a nd Employment in October 2015. This programme is aimed at students who lack the necessary qualifications to continue their studies, and focuses on preparing its students in Maltese, English, mathematics and physics at SEC level. 2 Data include both state and non-state (i.e. Church and independent) schools.

        "4 MALTA Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 As part of the national literacy strategy (Ministry for Education and Employment 2014a), the National Literacy Agency is offering the \u2018 Nwar Programme \u2019 . It is a family literacy programme for pupils who have not reached the required basic skills level by the end of the third year of primary school. In 2016, the National Literacy Agency will set up two additional Nwar centres and more children will therefore benefit from such programmes. A language policy for the early years 3 was published in 2015 (Ministry for Education and Employment 2015a). Its main emphasis is on encouraging bilingualism by promoting exposure to both English and Maltese in the early years. The biggest challenge in integrating foreign pupils is for those groups whose first language is not English. As from the 2015/2016 school year, non-English-speaking students are being offered a one-year induction course in basic functional English and Maltese. Work is being done by trained teachers, language support assistants and parent leaders, who support both students and parents. As from 2015/2016 too, MCAST has been offering a course in functional Maltese for non-Maltese speaking students at post-secondary level, as well as additional learning support in English through its Learning Support Unit. The reform of the national curriculum framework has led to the development of learning outcomes for all subjects within all the educational cycles of compulsory education. Learning outcomes will be used to benchmark and record the educational development of each Maltese student in compulsory education. The reform aims to move away from a prescriptive curriculum based on standalone subjects, towards a framework which allows for internal flexibility and promotes inclusiveness, citizenship and employability. During 2016, the government will prepare a plan to gradually implement the learning outcomes framework by September 2017. The Institute for Education will start to provide specific training to teachers (Ministry for Finance 2016). 5. Modernising school education Continuous professional development for Maltese educators is a key policy area for further work, in relation to early school leaving and basic skills attainment. Recent international research highlights the central role of teaching quality in determining student outcomes (Chetty et al. 2014; Hanushek and Rivkin 2012). As some major changes have been introduced in Malta \u2019 s education system (i.e. the introduction of mixed ability classes, benchmarking examination and e-learning tools), high-quality initial teacher education and continuous professional development are necessary, so as to promote student-centred learning. A legal notice establishing an institute for continuous professional development of all educators, the \u2018 Institute for Education \u2019 , was approved in 2015. The institute is now becoming operational (see Box 2 below). The Ministry for Education and Employment published a green paper on digital literacy in 2015 to raise awareness of the importance of digital skills and competencies (Ministry for Education and Employment 2015b). A \u2018 Technology in Education \u2019 t ask force has been set up within the Ministry for Education and Employment to coordinate strategic projects within the Ministry and with key stakeholders. A pilot project for using mobile technology in primary schools was completed in 2015, as part of the \u2018 One Tablet per Child \u2019 initiative. Following positive evaluation by the teachers involved in the pilot, by October 2016, every child in Year 4 (i.e. nine years old) will receive a tablet. Tablets will be used to promote better reading, writing, numeracy and digital literacy skills. Teachers assigned to Year 4 are to receive a 12-hour training course in September 2016 before the start of the school year. Box 2: Improving initial teacher education and continuous professional development A reform of initial teacher education will come into force as of 2016/2017. A two-year Master \u2019 s degree in Teaching and Learning will represent the route towards obtaining a teacher \u2019 s warrant. It can be pursued after obtaining a Bachelor \u2019 s degree in a subject area or a related area of the curriculum. To date, the current initial teacher training has required a 3 The expression \u2018 early years \u2019 refers to children aged three to seven. ",
        "MALTA 5 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 Bachelor of Education degree in Primary Education for primary teachers. For secondary level teachers, there are currently two routes: a Bachelor of Education degree over four years or a one-year postgraduate Certificate in Education following a Bachelor \u2019 s degree in the subject area. The Master\u2019s degree also includes a mentoring system. Students will be assigned to a school that they will attend twice a week, and a teacher-mentor will act as a critical friend at school and support them throughout their tasks and practice. The reform aligns initial teacher education to the Bologna system 4 and may help improve the quality of teaching in the long run. The main challenge is in finding an appropriate number of teachers to implement the mentoring scheme. The newly established Institute for Education is an autonomous body and will carry out functions related to continuous professional development and training of educators. The main objectives of the institute are to: \uf0b7 provide educators with skills to be used in their daily professional activities; \uf0b7 provide relevant and accessible accredited courses in a variety of areas; \uf0b7 act as a hub for teachers to meet and share common experiences; \uf0b7 promote educational leadership. The Institute received the licence by the National Commission for Further and Higher Education (NCFHE) to operate as a further education institution since it has developed a number of accredited learning programmes. A quality assurance document is being compiled to ensure quality of learning programmes, process and procedures. An accompanying internal quality assurance document is being compiled. Lasting commitment and a strategic approach to future years will be important, as measures to improve the quality of teaching require a long-term policy perspective. The fact that the teaching force is quite young may make this easier (European Commission 2016). In addition, the \u2018 Paid Study Leave Scheme \u2019 gives teachers the possibility of benefiting from study leave grants covering their salary for a maximum of one school year. The aim of this scheme is to assist teachers in pursuing their studies in the field of education and facilitate their professional development. The Directorate for Lifelong Learning and Early School Leavers in the Ministry of Education and Employment has organised a Diploma in Teaching Adults. Approximately 100 current and prospective adult educators are following the diploma course, which is accredited at level 5 of the MQF. The participants are expected to carry out practical training in order to graduate. This diploma course aims to raise the professional profile of adult educators and consequently improve the quality of adult education in Malta. 6. Modernising higher education The tertiary educational attainment rate of people aged 30-34 is still among the lowest in the EU (27.8 % in 2015) and well below the Europe 2020 national target of 33 %. However the rate increased by 5.6 percentage points over the last five years. The gender gap (female rate minus male rate) is slightly below the EU average: 8.6 percentage points against 9.4 percentage points. Inbound graduate mobility is rather high at Master \u2019 s level. The employment rate of recent tertiary graduates 5 increased by 3.8 percentage points between 2013 and 2015 and is now the highest in the EU, at 96.9 % (Figure 3). The government is increasing its allocation of both human and technical resources to the NCFHE to better fulfil its regulatory function in education. In 2016, the NCFHE issued a licence to a Jordanian company to start operating as a higher education institution under the name of \u2018American Institute of Malta\u2019. The University of Malta is also setting up a new body to monitor the quality of services it offers through each department, and another body to provide a comprehensive service to support staff \u2019 s research activities. 4 The Bologna system is, in most countries, based on a three-year Bachelor \u2019 s degree followed by a two- year Master \u2019 s degree. 5 People aged 20-34 who left tertiary education between one and three years before the reference year.

        "6 MALTA Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 A new Post-Doctoral Centre will be built on campus at the University of Malta to house post- doctoral researchers and provide an interim space for business incubation facilities. The University of Malta has continued with its initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, mainly through its new Centre for Entrepreneurship and Business Incubation. The centre\u2019s objective is to promote the development of an entrepreneurial culture in Malta, so as to foster the country\u2019s social and economic development. It currently focuses on knowledge-intensive sectors, such as science, technology, engineering and creative media. MCAST has reviewed and updated all its MQF level 5 Higher Diploma programmes and integrated them within its MQF Level 6 undergraduate degrees, while also developing new courses. As from academic year 2016/2017, MCAST will also start offering Master's programmes at MQF level 7. The national quality assurance framework for further and higher education was published in July 2015, at the end of the European Social Fund project \u2018 Making Quality Visible \u2019 . This measure will benefit students, who will, as a result, receive quality education and qualifications recognised by the NCFHE. Quality assurance audits are expected to start in 2016. The challenge that NCFHE currently faces is how to ensure that current and prospective further and higher education providers respect quality standards. NCFHE has already carried out the first External Quality Assurance Audits in 2016 among the main public further and higher education institutions in Malta \u2013 the University of Malta, MCAST and the Institute of Tourism Studies . This was done in line with the Commission\u2019s legal role for ensuring quality assurance in further and higher education in Malta. Figure 3. Employment rate of recent tertiary graduates (%) Source: Eurostat. Online data code: edat_lfse24 . 7. Modernising vocational education and training and promoting adult learning As the economic crisis had only a limited impact on Malta\u2019s economy, both the youth unemployment rate (11.8 % in 2015) and the proportion of young people not in employment, education or training (10.4 % of 15-24 year-olds in 2015) are well below the EU average. The employment rate of recent upper secondary graduates 6 increased by about 4 percentage points between 2014 and 2015. It is now the highest in the EU, at 91.6 %. Adult participation in lifelong learning is relatively low, at 7.2 % compared to an EU average of 10.7 % in 2015. This is due to the very low level of participation by people with low educational attainment (2.4 %), who still represent the majority of the Maltese adult population. 6 People aged 20-34 who left upper secondary education between one and three years before the reference year. 50 60 70 80 90 100 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Malta EU-28 Germany France Italy UK ",
        "MALTA 7 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 Vocational Education and Training (VET) subjects have now also been introduced at secondary school level. VET subjects at MQF level 3 have been piloted successfully within a number of secondary schools and have now been introduced within all the state and most of the non-state secondary schools. The choice of subjects (engineering technology, information technology, hospitality, health & social care and agribusiness) was inspired by needs expressed by the local industry. The percentage of students enrolling in one of these 5 VET subjects in secondary schools has increased from 9 % in 2014/2015 to 15 % in 2015/2016 and up to 25% in 2016/2017. A teacher training programme on the content, pedagogy and assessment of these vocational subjects has been offered to secondary school teachers who expressed an interest in teaching vocational subjects. The intention is to have this teacher training programme accredited as an MQF Level 6 or 7 qualification and to have initial teacher-training courses in place to cater also for these VET subject areas. The supply and quality of apprenticeships is increasing. As of June 2016, 829 students were following apprenticeships under courses offered by MCAST. The minimum proportion of on-the- job training in the overall apprenticeship programme is not yet set out in legislation. Apprenticeship programmes with separate provision of off-the-job and on-the-job learning have often resulted in learning experiences that are disconnected from each other (Cedefop 2015). MCAST has started addressing this issue. MCAST lecturers are assigned to visit students at the work place and liaise with employers to link the work experience of students with the learning experience of the respective courses. A sufficient supply of apprenticeships will be a good way to accelerate the adjustment of skills supply to specific labour market demand in Malta, thereby equipping graduates with relevant occupational skills. Malta has made efforts to reform and strengthen apprenticeship governance (European Commission 2015) and to create a culture for apprenticeships which aims to attract large number of students (including foreign students) and employers. The government acknowledges that there is scope to increase the number of sectors and the qualification levels offered and to develop their quality and labour market relevance (Cedefop/Refernet 2014). The authorities intend to develop a harmonised legal framework on apprenticeships which would also set out the employment status of apprentices. Further measures were announced in the 2016 budget \u2013 e.g. \u2018 Job Practice \u2019, which offers students a chance to increase their skills portfolio \u2013 but the extent to which these will be sufficient remains to be assessed. Traineeships are also being offered by Malta\u2019s Public Employment Service ( Jobsplus ). The Traineeship Scheme is intended to provide jobseekers with initial vocational training (pre- employment training) that will help individuals obtain the knowledge, skills and competence required to find and retain employment. Traineeships are based on the dual system of vocational training providing a combination of on-the-job and off-the-job training. The duration of a traineeship varies between 10 to 26 weeks, on an average of 40 hours per week. Malta is working to increase access to second chance education for those with no formal secondary education certificate, through the Foundation College of MCAST. As from October 2016 the MCAST Foundation College has developed Skills Kits courses which offer more flexible, customised pathways for persons not attracted to the present format of Foundation courses. These Skills Kits courses consist of short 20 hour programmes which students can achieve at their own pace and according to their needs. Further upskilling of adults with low qualifications could boost Malta\u2019s labour force and respond to some of the skills shortages. Delivery of adult learning courses is divided between public and private providers. There seems to be an overlap in training offered by public and private providers, although in practice they cater for different audience. 7 ICT, business and commerce and courses in human resources tend to be the most popular with students. Initiatives to improve adult career guidance to cater for the lifelong career needs of the population have been developed within the Public Employment Services, but further improvements should be sought, particularly for low skilled and older 7 Fees charged by private institutions are much higher than those charged by public ones. Therefore public institutions provide courses followed by those who may not afford to participate in private sector courses. ",

        "SUMMARY 11 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 Summary 1. Highlights of the cross-national analysis This year\u2019s Education and Training Monitor explores societal challenges in more depth and addresses migration, demography and the key competences that education should help develop. The Monitor then analyses progress in raising educational outcomes \u2014 by reducing early school leaving and underachievement and increasing tertiary educational attainment \u2014 at EU level and in individual Member States. Finally, via the cross-national comparison of education systems and in the country analysis, the report presents and examines plenty of policy initiatives that can help make education more responsive to societal and labour market needs. Challenges impacting on education and training Europe\u2019s population is ageing. In six EU Member States, the 5 -18 age group will shrink by at least 20 % by 2040. Another six Member States are facing decreases of between 10 % and 20 % in the same age group. At the same time, first-time asylum requests filed in the EU have increased by a factor of three since 2013, with more than 80 % of asylum applicants in 2015 being below the age of 34. As it has been shown in previous editions of this report, and as the analysis of available data shows, patterns of inequalities in education opportunities and outcomes still persist. Yet education and training are powerful policy levers to promote social, economic and cultural inclusion. While Europe\u2019s populations are changing, employment is changing too. Living and working in a technologically advanced and globalised economy requires individuals to acquire a higher level of skills. A higher level of educational qualifications is associated with a higher level of basic skills, and translates into higher employment rates. Recent graduates holding tertiary education degrees in 2015 had an employment rate of 81.9 %, which was 11.1 percentage points higher than those holding at most an upper secondary or a post-secondary non-tertiary diploma. Upgrading skills, particularly of low-qualified and disadvantaged groups, is therefore one of the main objectives of the New Skills Agenda. In addition to equipping students with knowledge and skills, and in light of the recent wave of populism and extremisms in Europe, all levels of education, including adult education, can also promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination, in ",
        "12 SUMMARY Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 accordance with the 2015 Paris Declaration and the Conclusions of the European Commission's first annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights 8 . More than half of the EU\u2019s Member States have recently introduced policies to ensure that children and youths acquire social, civic and intercultural skills. Policy action to increase education\u2019s potential to respond to societal challenges has been introduced mainly at primary and secondary school level. Effective education requires adequate investment. For the first time in three years, public expenditure on education increased in 2014, by 1.1 % in real terms. About two thirds of Member States raised spending, and the increase was greater than 5 % in six of them (BG, LV, HU, MT, RO and SK). The challenge of financing education lies in investing both sufficiently and effectively. Raising participation rates and tackling educational poverty Participation rates in education are increasing across the EU. This applies to early childhood education and continues, after the period of compulsory school education, into tertiary education. In early childhood education and care, participation of children from the age of 4 is generally high in the EU. In fact, in 2014, the EU was less than 1 percentage point away from meeting the 95 % participation target under the education and training 2020 framework (ET2020). Some further improvements are needed, however, to reach the Barcelona objective of having at least 33 % of children under 3 participating in ECEC: in 2014, the EU rate of participation of the youngest children (0-2) stood at 28 %, and it was below 20 % in 10 EU MS. Increasing the participation of children from disadvantaged groups is an important challenge for education in Europe, given the increasing recognition of the potential of quality ECEC in reducing disadvantage and laying a good foundation for further learning. At tertiary level, completion rates rose considerably across the EU in 2015. With a tertiary attainment rate of 38.7 %, and an increase of 0.8 percentage points since 2014, the EU is heading towards reaching the objective of having 40 % of tertiary graduates among the 8 Informal meeting of European Union education ministers (17.03.2015), Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education ; Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights (2015), Tolerance and respect: preventing and combating anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hatred in Europe: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/colloquium- fundamental-rights-2015/index_en.htm.

        "SUMMARY 13 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 population of 30-34 year-olds by 2020. Nonetheless, average values mask major disparities in the achievement of different groups. Qualification levels still vary between women and men, native- and foreign-born individuals, and regions and countries. As the 2015 Monitor showed, Europe has a persistent problem of educational poverty, defined as a failure to reach minimum standards in education. Underachievement among 15 year-olds remains worryingly high, especially in mathematics. Progress towards reducing early leaving from education and training has been considerable over the last decade, but has slowed somewhat in recent years. Between 2014 and 2015, the proportion of the population aged 18- 24 and not having an upper secondary diploma decreased by only 0.2 percentage points in the EU, and reached an overall EU average of 11 %. Targeting early school leaving also means reducing regional disparities and patterns of inequalities; for example, early school leaving for the non-EU born was twice that of the native born (19.8% vs. 10.1%) in 2015. Responsive education and training systems Reforming early childhood and primary education involves action on staff, curriculum and evaluation. The professionalization of educational staff in ECEC can drive more systematic professional development and positively impact the well-being and development of children. For example, MT, IE and BE have introduced a blend of requirements for higher qualifications to enter the profession, as well as systems to maintain staff skills and performance through continuing professional development. Comparative research points to the role of teaching staff in driving school innovation, which in turn can make education respond better to the needs of society and learners. In light of increasing diversity in schools, staff shortages and waning interest in teaching, a diverse teaching force, including men, young people and people from diverse ethnic backgrounds can offer pupils and students a wealth of role models. For example, in 2014 85 % of primary teachers in the EU were women, with four countries counting more than 95 % female teachers in the same educational level. Higher education, as well as secondary and tertiary professionally-oriented programmes, have a specific role in preparing individuals for the job market. Recent vocational graduates who are no longer in education or training had in 2015 an employment rate of 73 %, while the employment rate of recent upper-secondary education graduates from general orientation programmes was at 61.2 %. Nonetheless, vocational programmes generally tend to be less attractive than general orientation programmes. Elements that could be used to make vocational education and training (VET) more attractive and relevant to labour market needs include: taking work-based learning components into account across all VET programmes; improving permeability between ",
        "14 SUMMARY Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 VET and higher education; and better preparing young people for increasingly internationalised labour markets, including through foreign-language teaching. Higher education holds great potential for promoting upward social mobility and improving employment prospects. Policy measures to increase innovation and the relevance of higher education include personalised career guidance, graduate tracking and work-based learning. In particular, graduate tracking is increasingly common in higher education institutions; nine countries make systematic use of the information collected to improve career guidance and adjust study programmes accordingly (BE, DK, EE, IE, IT, PL, SK, SE, UK). The growing internationalisation of higher education is widely seen as an important positive factor in boosting its quality and relevance. Available evidence shows that learning mobility is a predictor of better employability prospects and career development. Learning does not end when individuals complete their formal education. Reaching the EU target of having 15 % of adults participating in lifelong learning is proving difficult. The average adult learning rate stood at 10.7 % in 2014 and did not increase in 2015. Furthermore, in a number of EU Member States, the gap in accessing learning between the average population and adults with a disadvantaged status persisted or even increased. Policy measures to bring the EU closer to reaching the target on lifelong learning and increase employability would start from assessment, validation and certification of existing skills. Ideally these steps would be followed by further actions to improve all learners' willingness to learn, encourage employers to take a more active role, provide dedicated support to disadvantaged groups, and ensure quality, relevance and effectiveness of adult learning systems. 2. Highlights of the country analysis AT The early school leaving rate is markedly better than the EU average, and participation in early childhood education and care has increased. National and international tests show deficiencies in basic skills, and a strong impact of socioeconomic and migrant backgrounds on education results. Implementation of the November 2015 education reform has started. Additional resources are generated from a bank levy. Austria is taking various measures to ensure the integration of the high number of recently arrived refugees into education and training. Against the background of increasing student numbers, the 2016-2021 plan for higher education sets strategic objectives and emphasises better teaching, but the funding available falls short of the identified needs. Participation in vocational education and training is high and provides relevant skills. BE Major schools reforms have been launched which aim to improve equity, key competences and vocational education and training. New modes of governance should increase efficiency and enhance collaborative approaches. Measures are taken to address shortages in educational infrastructure. Belgium faces significant equity challenges. Pupils\u2019 performance is strongly linked to their socioeconomic background, particularly for those of migrant origin. This is all the more serious because the disadvantaged groups within the school population are those forecast to increase the most. The early school leaving rate is slightly better than the EU average, but disparities across the Communities and Regions persist. Disadvantaged schools lack experienced teachers and heads. Teachers need support to teach in an increasingly diverse environment. The higher educational attainment rate is above average. Initiatives are taken to address the low proportion of students and graduates in science and technology which is a concern for future innovation capacity. BG Bulgaria is taking the first steps in the implementation of the Pre-school and School Education Act with the adoption of several state educational standards. The early school leaving rate increased and shows large regional variations. In terms of educational outcomes, vulnerable groups such as Roma and pupils from rural areas perform significantly below average. In tertiary education, attainment rates continue to increase and a model for performance-based financing was introduced, but several challenges remain including insufficient labour market relevance. General government expenditure on education remains among the lowest in the EU. ",
        "SUMMARY 15 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 CY Cyprus has considerably improved its performance on early school leaving and has maintained a very high rate of tertiary educational attainment. It has also initiated a strategic reform of the vocational education and training sector, both at upper-secondary and post-secondary levels. This effort aims to achieve a better balance between that sector and mostly private higher education, which strongly predominates at present. However, the persistence of relatively low levels of basic skills and the continued lack of efficiency of public spending in the education system are still major challenges for the country. Cyprus has established a new Agency of Quality Assurance and Accreditation in higher education. The question of ensuring proper quality assurance and accreditation of institutions and programmes \u2014 and particularly in private colleges \u2014 will constitute a test case for Cyprus in the future. CZ Educational outcomes and the employability of school and higher education graduates are generally good. But the national early school leaving rate, although still outperforming the EU average, has been worsening over the past years. Pupils' socioeconomic background strongly influences educational performance, and the participation of Roma in mainstream education needs to increase. Authorities have taken major measures to support the implementation of the pro- inclusive legislation adopted in 2015. Teachers\u2019 salaries remain low compared to other countries and the teacher population is ageing, requiring further measures to increase the attractiveness of the profession to talented young people. Levels of tertiary educational attainment continue to increase rapidly and the long-awaited reform of higher education was adopted. On-going reforms have been subject to extensive consultations and awareness-raising campaigns. These aim to make best use of the knowledge and expertise of subject experts and stakeholders and increase ownership by actors on the ground. DE Participation in all forms of education increased and outcomes improved, including for disadvantaged groups. Socioeconomic background however still has a major impact on education outcomes. Integrating the high number of recently arrived refugees is a major challenge. A large proportion of the refugees are young and poorly qualified. Almost half of a youth cohort start higher education. Higher education is also attracting an increasing number of international students, in particular in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. The well-established dual training system is struggling to attract enough apprentices in certain regions and sectors. Combined with negative demographic trends, this may lead to a lack of skilled workers. Addressing the key challenges will require additional investment in education, which remains low by international comparison. DK Denmark has low early school leaving rates, but the gender gap is higher than in neighbouring countries. The tertiary educational attainment rate is one of the highest in the EU. Denmark has the highest proportion of vocational education and training students in work-based programmes of all the EU countries; also adult participation in lifelong learning is one of the highest in the EU. In view of the fact that Denmark\u2019s expenditure on education is the highest in the EU and to reduce costs and improve efficiency in the public sector, the financial bill for 2016 made budgetary cuts across the education sector. The \u2018Growth and Development Strategy\u2019 ( V\u00e6kst og Udvikling i hele Danmark ) announces the intention to support quality of teaching and online learning in school education and tertiary education. The 2016 reform of general upper secondary education aims to raise academic standards, provide a solid preparation for higher education and encourage more young people to choose a vocational education and training pathway. EE Estonia continues to have a well-performing education system combining a low proportion of under achievers with a low impact of socio economic status on education outcomes. Tertiary educational attainment is one of the highest in the EU. The employment rate of recent graduates has recovered after the economic crisis. Estonia is implementing a comprehensive Lifelong Learning Strategy. This brings a new approach to learning by emphasising individual and social development, and the acquisition of skills at all levels and in all types of education. The main challenges are to adapt to demographic trends, increasing the attractiveness of the teaching profession, further reducing early school leaving, and narrowing the performance gap between Estonian-speaking and Russian- speaking students. ",
        "16 SUMMARY Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 EL Early school leaving and tertiary educational attainment rates improved significantly and are now better than the EU average. Performance is disappointing on basic skills attainment by young people and adults, and on participation in vocational education and training as well as in adult learning. A national dialogue on education and a review of the education system are highlighting key problems such as serious underfunding, teacher staffing, equity and efficiency. The reversal of previous reforms aimed at increasing transparency, accountability and evaluation in schools and higher education is a matter of concern. Greece has adopted sectorial strategies on higher education, vocational education and lifelong learning. Their implementation will be a challenge. The impact of the refugee crisis on the Greek education sector remains fairly limited for the time being, but might have more far-reaching consequences in the future. ES The 2016 political impasse has limited progress on education reforms: the future of the 2013 Organic Law for Improvement of the Quality of Education (LOMCE) is questioned and the reform of the teaching profession remains on hold. Spain has increased the education budget since 2015, but the previous accumulated financial cuts have reduced equity in education, and the effectiveness of education spending can be improved. Enrolment and transition rates in the 'basic vocational education and training' programme are below expectations after the first two years of implementation. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport is making significant efforts to prevent violence in schools and promote civic education and fundamental values. A new tracking system for graduates should help to improve the relevance of university programmes and graduates' employability rates. The Government takes initiatives to support cooperation between universities, businesses and research centres but university governance and financing systems do not create a favourable environment. FI The Government identified six key \u2018knowledge and education\u2019 projects in its strategic \u2018Vision: Finland 2025\u2019 and has to implement these in a fiscal consolidation environment. The educational outcomes of 15-year-olds are still some of best in the EU, but have decreased recently across all groups. Curricula are being modernised at all levels of education. The tertiary educational attainment rate is amongst the highest in the EU. Higher education is undergoing reform to increase its efficiency and relevance. The proportion of students in vocational education and training, and of adults in lifelong learning, is amongst the highest in the EU. FR France is engaged in three major reforms across all sectors and levels of education and training. Reforms in compulsory education, higher education and vocational training aim to improve equity and efficiency through early prevention, collaborative teaching and new governance models. Pupils\u2019 performance is strongly linked to their socioeconomic background. Too many young people leave education with few or no qualifications. There are large performance gaps between schools. Disadvantaged schools benefit less from experienced teachers, and school segregation reflects socioeconomic, academic and migrant backgrounds as well as residential segregation. The tertiary educational attainment rate is high. However, the university system, with its relatively low tuition fees and open access, is under pressure from steadily rising student numbers. Despite greater priority given to primary education, spending remains uneven between the different education stages. By international comparison, spending per student is significantly higher for upper secondary education. HR The very low early school leaving rate and the high proportion of secondary vocational school graduates entering higher education are the main strengths of the system. International studies point to skills deficiencies among 15-year-olds in numeracy, literacy and reading skills. Political disagreements have slowed down the implementation of the landmark Strategy for Education, Science and Technology and the associated curricular reform. Participation in early childhood education and care and in adult education are extremely low compared to other EU countries. Aligning vocational, higher and adult education with the labour market needs by developing qualification standards in consultation with social partners is a praiseworthy but lengthy process that has not yet yielded tangible results. ",
        "SUMMARY 17 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 HU Hungarian education faces important equity challenges. Students' performance is strongly linked to their socioeconomic background, and the participation of disadvantaged groups, in particular Roma people, in inclusive mainstream education needs to increase. From 2015/2016 the compulsory starting age for early childhood education and care was lowered from five to three years to better prepare children for school and so reduce the risk of children dropping out later on. The government announced the transfer of the operation of public schools from the municipalities to the state and the decentralisation of the state school maintainer organisation as of January 2017. Dual study programmes were introduced in higher education in 2015/2016 to improve the labour market relevance of degree programmes. A new core curriculum was introduced for vocational grammar schools in 2016/2017, under which the teaching hours for vocation-specific subjects were increased at the expense of science subjects. IE Ireland performs very well on early school leaving and tertiary educational attainment and has made significant progress in improving the provision of basic skills. The growing fiscal space created by the recent and rapid economic recovery lessens pressure on public expenditure on education and allows for substantially increased capital investment, i.e. in developing educational infrastructure. The affordability and full-time provision of quality early childhood education and care remain a challenge. Equity and access to higher education for disadvantaged groups are still issues. There are emerging skills shortages in certain sectors of the economy (e.g. ICT) and a need to further up-skill and reskill the adult population, in particular by increasing participation in further education and training. IT The 2015 school reform and the national system for the evaluation of schools are being implemented and could improve school outcomes. Although still above the EU average, the early school leaving rate is steadily declining. Participation in early childhood education is high for four- to six-year-olds. More attention is being paid to the quality of higher education and the framework for allocating public funding to universities has significantly improved in recent years. Italy has the lowest tertiary educational attainment rate in the EU for 30- to 34-year-olds. The higher education system is underfunded and faces the problem of ageing and declining teaching staff. Transition from education to work is difficult, even for highly qualified people. This is causing a \u2018brain drain\u2019. LT Lithuania is reforming the teacher profession to improve its attractiveness, the quality of initial teacher training and continuous professional development. Lithuania has a very low early school leaving rate, but pupils\u2019 reading and maths skills are below the EU average. According to national tests, almost one fifth of 16-year-olds lack basic knowledge and skills. The participation rate in early childhood education and care is low when compared to the EU average, and there are significant disparities between urban and rural areas. The Government has taken several measures to increase participation rates and quality. Lithuania has the highest tertiary educational attainment rate in the EU. The quality and innovation outcomes of higher education, in particular the quality of teaching and provision of soft skills, and practical training in higher education remain challenges. Only a small percentage of adults participate in lifelong learning. As vocational education and training remains an unattractive option for students and their parents, there is a need to improve its quality and cooperation with companies. LU In Luxembourg virtually all children participate in early childhood education and care from age four. Recent measures aim at improving the quality of these services, particularly to reduce socio-economic disadvantages. The proportion of early school leavers is still below the EU average but increased in 2015. All students learn two foreign languages in lower- secondary education. Trilingual education, however, represents a challenge for many students and affects their success in all school subjects. Luxembourg has the EU's second- highest tertiary educational attainment rate among 30-34 year-olds and has significantly increased funding in this sector in recent years. LV In recent years, Latvia has made remarkable progress in reducing its early school leaving rate and improving basic skills attainment. Latvia is gradually introducing a new financing model in the higher education system, with elements to reward quality. Measures on accreditation are promising, although implementation is still at an early stage. The tertiary educational attainment rate is high, but supplying graduates to knowledge intensive ",
        "18 SUMMARY Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 sectors and attracting international students remain a challenge. Vocational education and training is undergoing significant reform, but there is still considerable scope for expanding the work-based learning components and updating the curricula. The gender gap in education is a challenge across the board, with women outperforming men significantly both in terms of qualifications and basic skill proficiency. MT Malta is investing heavily in its education and training system. Recent positive measures on school education aim to modernise curricula, improve teaching quality and promote digital skills. Transition from education to the labour market is easier than in most other EU countries. Despite recent progress, the early school leaving rate remains the second highest in the EU and the tertiary educational attainment rate is still low. Participation of low-skilled adults in lifelong learning is rather low. NL The Dutch education system is among the best performing in the EU as regards participation in early childhood education and care, the share of low achievers among 15- year-olds and tertiary educational attainment. The changes in the funding system for higher education provide room for investment in improving quality, but the impact on accessibility and educational inequality will need careful monitoring. Measures taken to increase the attractiveness of the teaching profession are especially important because a shortage of teachers is expected. Differentiating teaching methods according to students\u2019 learning needs in increasingly diverse classrooms, in order to help and motivate all students to reach their full potential, remains a challenge. PL Poland is one of the best performing EU countries on early school leaving and basic skills achievement, but faces challenges in the teaching of transversal skills. The new government has launched a major reform of school education. Participation in early childhood education and care has increased significantly in recent years. However, quality of provision, particularly for children under the age of three, is a challenge and regional differences in access persist. The recent decision to raise the school entry age to seven is not following international evidence stressing the importance of early learning. While tertiary educational attainment is high, the quality of higher education and its labour market relevance remain challenges. The government launched a major consultation process on the future of the Polish higher education system. The quality and labour market relevance of vocational education and training is still limited. A new form of dual education is being introduced. Adult participation in lifelong learning is one of the lowest in the EU, and the basic skills levels among adults are comparatively poor, particularly in ICT. The introduction of the integrated qualifications system and national qualifications framework is a step forward. PT The Portuguese Government has announced a series of measures to improve equity in education and fight school failure. The 2016 budget for education does not provide for significant increases from the previous year: it is envisaged that financial support for the reforms will come from increased expenditure efficiency and a decline in grade repetition. Citizenship and intercultural education are becoming more relevant in the school curricula and the integration of migrants into the education system is being strengthened. The downward trend in university enrolment, together with the high rate of highly qualified Portuguese nationals migrating to other European countries, is aggravating the country's demographic crisis and could hamper its competitiveness. The new higher education technical vocational courses are raising enrolment in polytechnic institutes and opening up new avenues of cooperation with the business sector. RO Romania is modernising school curricula towards competence-based learning. Early school leaving continued to increase in 2015 and is the third highest in the EU. Students from rural areas, poor families and Roma are particularly exposed to the risk of drop-out and educational poverty. Participation in pre-school education is expected to increase following the introduction of cash-conditional transfers for children from poor families. Tertiary educational attainment has risen so that it is now very close to the national target, but it is still one of the lowest in the EU and ensuring labour market relevance of higher education is a challenge. Vocational education and training qualifications and curricula are not sufficiently attuned with labour market needs and adult participation in lifelong learning is the lowest in the EU. Despite some improvements, public expenditure on ",
        "SUMMARY 19 Education and Training Monitor 2016 \u2013 Country analysis November 2016 education continues to be very low. SE Sweden invests heavily in education and training, with general government expenditure on education being among the highest in the EU. Sweden has one of the highest tertiary educational attainment rates in the EU for 30-34 year-olds and the employment rate of its recent tertiary graduates is very high. School education outcomes in terms of basic skills proficiency declined continuously over the past decade. This could translate into declining skill levels of adults in the future. The increasing performance gap between foreign-born and native-born students is a challenge: school segregation may well have increased in a system with greater school choice. Integrating the large number of newly arrived students in the education system is a major challenge; Sweden can however build successfully on its policy tradition and current efforts. SI With a growing number of tertiary-educated people and a low rate of early school leaving, Slovenia has already met its national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy. Fluctuating demographic trends pose a great challenge to maintaining a consolidated network of schools and an efficient system of school funding. The proportion of tertiary graduates among the unemployed has been on the increase, pointing to youth employability issues. The higher education sector is undergoing reforms which aim to increase completion rates, encourage internationalisation and strengthen internal quality assurance. Vocational education is attended by a large number of young people, yet apprenticeships are being reintroduced to engage employers further and improve transition to the labour market. SK The new Government has embarked on ambitious reforms at all education levels and begun preparing a 10-year education strategy. It has also committed to engaging in wide consultations to support these processes. Pupils\u2019 socioeconomic background has a high impact on educational performance and the participation of Roma in mainstream education needs to increase. While the national early school leaving rate remains low compared with the EU, it has been worsening since 2010 and is particularly high in the eastern regions and among the Roma. The capacity of early childhood education and care is being strengthened to enable higher participation rates. This could in particular benefit the educational outcomes of socioeconomically disadvantaged pupils. Making the teaching profession more attractive to talented young people and strengthening all phases of teacher education will be key to improving educational outcomes and reducing educational inequity. The higher education sector is subject to a wide reform covering accreditation, funding, cooperation with employers and widening the social makeup of the student population. UK Despite differences in approaches to addressing certain challenges, the education systems in the UK perform well in many areas monitored as part of the Education and Training 2020 framework. The UK has a very high tertiary educational attainment rate and a declining early school leaving rate. Compared to other EU countries, the UK performs well in participation in early childhood education and care for children aged four and over, and in adult participation in lifelong learning. The main challenges for the UK\u2019s education systems include improving the level of basic skills of 15-year-olds (especially maths among girls) and widening access to higher education for students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds.
