        "J. whereas it is essential that EPAs should contribute to sustainable social and economic development and to the alleviation of poverty in ACP countries, K. whereas, in an increasingly globalised world, preference erosion is inevitable, L. whereas Everything but Arms (EBA) has so far failed to give rise to a significant increase in Least Developed Countries' (LDCs) exports to the EU; whereas that suggests that tariff and quota liberalisation alone do not make poor countries more competitive, M. whereas increased reciprocity between the EU and the ACP countries should spur the competitiveness of ACP countries but it is likely to harm uncompetitive industries, the agricultural sector, which has hardly been modernised or diversified, and fragile economies, N. whereas EPA configurations are not always in line with existing regional economic integration arrange- ments, thus running counter to the priority objective of consolidating regional integration in the ACP countries, O. whereas agriculture is the engine of development in most ACP countries and in order for EPAs to become a development tool, they must address the challenges faced by the ACP agricultural sector, P. whereas establishing a genuine regional market represents an essential basis for successfully implement- ing EPAs; whereas genuine regional integration represents an important basis for the social and eco- nomic development of the ACP countries, as is stated in the Cotonou agreement, Q. whereas an increase in intra-regional trade, as is intended by the EPAs, is hindered by weak intraregional infrastructure and a wide range of non-tariff barriers to trade, R. whereas the failure of the Regional Preparatory Task Forces to carry out their intended function has hindered negotiations and raised questions about the future efficacy of EPA-related monitoring mechanisms, S. whereas a lack of analytical data in relation to ACP economies has made full EPA impact assessments very difficult to carry out, T. whereas improved trade rules must be accompanied by an increase in support for trade-related assistance, U. whereas the objective of Aid for Trade is to support developing countries' capacities to take advantage of new trade opportunities, V. whereas a solution to the issue of adjustment costs, relating to preparations and implementation of liberalisation required as part of the EPAs, must be found, W. whereas, pursuant to Article 37(4) of the Cotonou Agreement, a formal and comprehensive review of the arrangements planned for all countries must be undertaken in order to ensure that no further time is needed for preparations or negotiations; whereas that review must lead to a critical assessment of the EPA negotiations in progress; 1. Believes that EPAs must be designed as instruments for development and that they must contribute to increased economic growth, regional integration and the reduction of poverty; 2. Reaffirms its view that, if appropriately designed, EPAs represent an opportunity to revitalise ACP \u2014 EU trading relations, promote ACP economic diversification and regional integration and to reduce poverty in the ACP countries; C 102 E/304 EN 24.4.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 23 May 2007 ",
        "3. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure policy coherence for development; stresses that the \u2018 European Consensus on Development \u2019 (Development Policy Statement, DSP), in particular para- graph 36, provides the EPA negotiators with guidance; urges, in this respect, the Commission to adhere to the principles of asymmetry and flexibility; 4. Recognises that it is important for the ACP countries and the EU to fully assume the necessary responsibility to ensure the right of ACP countries to development and well being; urges ACP governments to implement good governance rules, drawing, inter alia, on the technical assistance provided for under the Aid for Trade instrument; 5. Recalls that, by the end of the EPA negotiations no ACP country should, in its trade relations, find itself in a more unfavourable situation after 2007 than under current arrangements; 6. Expresses concern at the slow pace of the negotiations and the consequent lack of tangible progress, with many critical issues yet to be discussed or agreed upon; 7. Urges negotiators not to work under excessive pressure or in a hurry on such complex and extremely important negotiations; urges the Commission to show more flexibility towards ACP concerns; 8. Calls on the Commission not to exert undue pressure and \u2014 in the event of negotiations not being completed by 1 January 2008 \u2014 make efforts at WTO level to seek to ensure that disruption of existing ACP exports to the EU is avoided pending a final settlement; 9. Calls for greater transparency on the progress and substance of the negotiations; calls for all parties to ensure that parliamentarians and other stakeholders in the ACP countries and the EU are consulted on the EPA negotiations so as to achieve an appropriate implementation of EPAs; 10. Calls on the Commission to do its utmost to conclude the negotiations on the DDA and ensure that the liberalisation agreements promote development in poor countries; 11. Is convinced that EPAs should be complementary to an agreement on the DDA and not an alterna- tive, and that a pro-development conclusion to EPAs could be a first step towards a development-focused multilateral agreement; 12. Recognises that preferential market access has not been a sufficient tool in itself to bring about the development of the ACP countries and maintains that, in order to achieve that goal, flanking measures need to be put in place to boost their competitiveness; 13. Calls for full duty-free, quota-free market access for the ACP as well as simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin in EPAs than is the case under EBA, taking into account the differences in the level of industrial development between the EU and the ACP countries as well as among ACP countries; 14. Calls for the pace, timing and scope of liberalisation to be gradual and flexible in order to improve ACP regional integration and competitiveness, and to ensure that development objectives, such as the avoid- ance of adverse social impacts, particularly towards women, are given priority; 15. Calls for the special case of the EU Member States' overseas regions and territories to be taken fully into account in the EPA negotiations, especially the outermost regions referred to in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty; 24.4.2008 EN C 102 E/305 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 23 May 2007 ",
        "16. Urges ACP countries to resolve the problem pertaining to the membership of overlapping regional groups; 17. Calls for negotiators to develop a strategy for diversifying, modernising, and boosting ACP competi- tiveness \u2014 particularly in the agricultural sector \u2014 thus going beyond market access; 18. Recognises that workable safeguard mechanisms, allowing ACP regions to counter surges in imports from the EU, are essential, particularly for agricultural products; 19. Calls on the EU to promote Fair Trade and other means to improve conditions for small and margin- alised producers and poor workers; 20. Reminds the negotiators that, when improving agricultural competitiveness strategies in ACP coun- tries, due regard should be paid to food security; 21. Stresses that it is essential to ensure that ACP countries preserve the right to protect some sensitive products; 22. Recognises that the Sustainable Impact Assessments (SIAs) have failed to have a meaningful impact on negotiations and calls on the Commission to clarify and review the link between SIAs and negotiating positions, in order to give stakeholders the opportunity to be heard; 23. Calls for an appropriate and transparent monitoring mechanism \u2014 with a clear role and influence \u2014 to be set up at both regional and national levels in order to follow the impact of EPAs with increased ACP ownership and broad stakeholder consultation; 24. Calls on the Council and the Commission to clarify the extent to which the financing of the \u2018 devel- opment dimension \u2019 of EPAs will be available beyond the 10th European Development Fund (EDF); 25. Welcomes the conclusion of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 16 October 2006 that \u2018 a substantial share of the Community and Member States' commitment to increase their trade-related assistance to EUR 2 billion by 2010 has to be devoted to the ACP countries \u2019 , though regrets that not all of this money is \u2018 additional to EDF resources \u2019 and urges the Commission and Member States to clarify the precise terms of these commitments, to guarantee that this assistance is not conditional on the outcome of EPA negotiations, and to work towards significantly increasing the amount of available Aid for Trade as demand from ACP states increases; 26. Endorses the Council's invitation to the Commission and the Member States to support \u2018 as an immediate priority the implementation of EPA-related reform commitments \u2019 and calls for concrete commit- ments to be made prior to the conclusion of EPA negotiations, which are detailed, quantified and specifically EPA-related, addressing both trade-related assistance and the adjustment costs associated with EPAs; 27. Calls for EPA support to be coordinated and linked to the multi-lateral Aid for Trade enhanced integrated framework; 28. Insists that, in keeping with the Paris Principles on Aid Effectiveness, aid must be, inter alia, demand- driven, and calls on the ACP, therefore, to put forward, with appropriate EU-assistance where required, detailed, costed proposals of how and for what additional EPA-related funds are needed, particularly with regard to regulatory frameworks, safeguard measures, trade facilitation, support in meeting international sanitary and phytosanitary and intellectual property standards, and the composition of the EPA monitoring mechanism; 29. Asks the Commission, when requested, to provide ACP countries with additional technical assistance for trade negotiations; C 102 E/306 EN 24.4.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 23 May 2007 ",
        "30. Calls on the Commission to provide assistance, when requested, to ACP countries which decide to undertake fiscal reform programmes; 31. Notes the poor levels of revenue collection in many ACP countries and calls for additional support for tax reforms and measures for the prevention of tax evasion, as part of a strategy to minimise the effect of lost tariff revenues; is also worried about the impact of falling customs revenue on ACP budgets, which could entail public spending cuts in key sectors such as education or health; calls on the EU to help to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort; 32. Recalls that ACP countries are often heavily dependent on primary commodities, and calls on the EU to develop more effective instruments of support in relation to production adjustment and diversification, as well as to the development of processing industries and small and medium-sized enterprises in ACP countries; 33. Understands ACP reluctance to negotiate bilaterally on so-called Singapore issues which have been removed from multilateral negotiations and recognises that it is for ACP regional groups to judge the development benefits of any agreements on these issues; recalls the fact that 77 poor countries opposed the inclusion of negotiations on Singapore issues in the DDA agenda; 34. Believes that appropriately framed agreements on investment, competition and government procure- ment, accompanied by a credible regulatory environment, could contribute to shared aims of good govern- ance and transparency, creating an environment that should enable greater private-public partnership, parti- cularly in relation to key infrastructure development; 35. Expresses disappointment at the fact that so far insufficient advantage has been taken of the oppor- tunity provided by the review to involve parliamentarians and other stakeholders; believes that the inclusion of key stakeholders and civil society representatives would add a crucial practical and pragmatic dimension to this process; 36. Recognises the social and environmental responsibilities of foreign businesses and investors towards the communities and societies in which they invest; believes that people-to-people business and investment contacts should be encouraged and facilitated in order to maximise the social and economic benefits of increased liberalisation; 37. Urges the Commission and the ACP countries to use the EPA review as an opportunity to openly discuss the obstacles to the completion of negotiations and to put forward detailed proposals to overcome them; 38. Recalls ACP requests in a number of fora for alternatives to EPAs, but notes the absence of official ACP requests under Article 37(6) of the Cotonou Agreement; 39. Requests the Commission, in accordance with Article 37(6) of the Cotonou Agreement, where non- least developed ACP countries are not in a position to enter into EPAs, to examine possible ways of offering those countries an alternative framework for trade, which is equivalent to the existing situation and which is in conformity with WTO rules; 40. Asks the Commission to make proposals for development-oriented alternatives that offer more than mere market access, as is the case for EBA and the special incentive arrangement for sustainable develop- ment and good governance (GSP+); 41. Calls on the Commission to promote social standards and decent work in the EPA trade negotiations; 24.4.2008 EN C 102 E/307 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 23 May 2007 ",
        "42. Calls on the Commission to clarify the implications, in terms of Aid for Trade and EPA-related support, for countries that choose not to sign up to EPAs; 43. Calls on the Commission and the Council to simplify and reduce the bureaucratic burden of EDF requirements and to improve training, in the ACP, in relation to EDF procedures in order to maximise the use of existing resources; 44. Recalls that bilateral negotiations on trade in services must abstain from pressuring ACP countries into offering any liberalisation of basic public services, respect the right of countries to freely regulate public services and calls on both parties to recognise that sound regulatory frameworks are an essential part of any liberalisation process; 45. Calls for the EU not to include, in EPAs, provisions on intellectual property rights, since they con- stitute an additional barrier to access to essential medicines and to use the EPA system to help ACP coun- tries implement the forms of flexibility provided for in the Doha Declaration; points out that, by virtue of the 2001 Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, the EU has undertaken to place public health before its trading interests; 46. Stresses that the regional aspect of EPAs is essential for boosting not only North-South but also South-South trade; considers that insufficient attention has been paid to that matter by the European side and that achieving proper intra-regional integration may even be more important than launching a pro- gramme for inter-regional integration; 47. Calls for a dispute settlement system for EPAs, which is sufficiently simple and cost-effective, to promptly intervene when parties fail to meet their commitments; 48. Calls for appropriate proposals to be made in order to address ACP concerns on Mode IV of the GATS; 49. Recommends that the Commission ensure that the international programme on Decent Work and the implementation of core labour standards become permanent elements in trade negotiations and strategic partnerships; calls on the Commission to ensure the implementation of Article 50 of the Cotonou Agree- ment, which includes a specific provision on trade and labour standards and which confirms the parties' commitments to core labour standards; 50. Recognises that high phytosanitary and other EU health and environmental standards may hinder ACP exports, particularly of agricultural goods, and calls on the Commission and Member States to help ACP countries to devise adequate programmes to reach these standards in a timely fashion; 51. Calls on the Commission to take the initiative and to mobilise international support for a revision or clarification of Article XXIV of the GATT Agreement with regard to the Free Trade Agreements between parties with different levels of development; 52. Calls on the Commission to carry out a systematic analysis, during the negotiations and following their conclusion, of the social impact of EPAs on the groups most at risk, including young people and women in the ACP countries; 53. Recognises the importance of parliamentary oversight in contributing to good governance, account- ability and transparency; C 102 E/308 EN 24.4.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 23 May 2007 ",
        "54. Calls for the creation of a joint Parliamentary Trade and Development Committee within each Eco- nomic Partnership Agreement working with the ACP-EU JPA to publicly monitor and review the trade and development impact of EPA implementation, to design mechanisms to ensure accountability and to address EPA-related concerns from both regional and all-ACP perspectives; 55. Urges the Commission to regularly consult with national parliaments in ACP countries in order to facilitate their scrutiny of the process and, furthermore, recommends that there should be regular follow-up by the relevant Committee of the JPA and by European and ACP parliamentarians in plenary sessions; 56. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member States and of the ACP countries, the ACP-EU Council and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
