(2) Under Article 15(2)(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003, implementing measures are necessary for the list of target secondary areas and variables to be included each year in the cross-sectional component of EU-SILC. For the year 2009, the list of target secondary variables included in the module on material deprivation should be laid down. This should be accompanied by the provision of variable codes and definitions. (3) The Statistical Programme Committee has not delivered a favourable opinion. This being so, following the procedure laid down in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003, the Commission is, without delay, to submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken and shall inform the European Parliament, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The list of target secondary variables, the variable codes, and the definitions for the 2009 module on material deprivation to be included in the cross-sectional component of Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) shall be as laid down in the Annex.

        "ANNEX For the purposes of this Regulation, the following units, modes of data collection, reference periods and definitions shall apply. 1. UNITS The target variables relate to three different types of unit. The variables relating to housing, the environment, financial stress and durables (except possession of mobile phones) are asked at household level and refer to the household as a whole. Information on the possession of a mobile phone, basic needs, unmet needs as well as leisure and social activities in the category \u2018 adult items \u2019 must be provided for each current household member or, if applicable, for all selected respondents, aged 16 and over. Children \u2019 s items relate to all household members aged under 16 to be compatible with the data collection defined in the Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003. The questions must be answered by the household respondent for the whole group of children aged under 16. If at least one child does not have the item in question, the whole group of children in the household is assumed not to have the item. 2. MODES OF DATA COLLECTION For variables asked at household level (section 1 in the list below), the mode of data collection is personal interview with the household respondent. For variables asked at individual level (section 2 in the list below), the mode of data collection is personal interview with all current household members aged 16 and over or, if applicable, with each selected respondent. For children \u2019 s variables (section 3 in the list below), the mode of collection is personal interview with the household respondent. Owing to the characteristics of the information to be collected, only personal interviews (proxy interviews as an exception for persons temporarily absent or incapacitated) are allowed. 3. REFERENCE PERIODS All target variables relate to the current situation as the reference period, except for the two variables on the expectation of the household to change dwelling, which refers to the next six months, and the variables on unmet needs and on the visit to general practitioners and specialists, which refer to the past 12 months. 4. DEFINITIONS (1) Housing items (a) Change of dwelling: \u2014 the reference period is \u2018 the next six months \u2019 . If the household expects to change dwelling for several reasons during the reference period, the main reason should be given, \u2014 eviction/distraint: forced to move for legal reasons, \u2014 financial difficulties: problems paying rent/mortgage, EN 24.4.2008 Official Journal of the European Union L 112/3 ",
        "\u2014 family-related reasons: change in marital/partnership status, to establish own household, to follow part- ner/parents, to obtain better school or care facilities for children or other dependants, \u2014 employment-related reasons: start new job or transfer of existing job, looking for work or made redundant, to be closer to work/easier to commute, retirement, \u2014 other reasons: housing-related reasons (desire to change accommodation or tenure status, wanting new or better house/apartment, seeking better neighbourhood/less crime), studies-related reasons (attending or leaving college/university), health and other reasons; (b) Shortage of space: the variable refers to the respondent \u2019 s opinion/perception about shortage of space in the dwelling. (2) Environmental items (a) Accessibility: this relates to the services used by the household with regard to financial, physical, technical and health conditions. Accessibility of services is to be assessed in terms of physical and technical access, and opening hours, but not in terms of quality, price and similar aspects. Consequently, the access should refer to an objective and physical reality. It should not be based on a subjective feeling. Access should be determined in relation to the services actually used by the household. Physical access has to be assessed in terms of distance but also of infrastructure and equipment for example for respondents with a physical disability. The services provided at home should also be taken into account, if they are actually used by the household. Accessibility has thus to be evaluated regardless of the way(s) the household access to the service. The respondent should give an answer for the household as a whole. If the respondent does not use a service but other household member(s) do, he or she should assess the accessibility according to this(these) other household member(s); (b) Public transport: bus, metro, tram and similar; (c) Postal or banking services: send and receive ordinary and parcel post, withdraw cash, transfer money and pay bills. Technical access could also intervene. Accessibility in terms of phone-banking and PC-banking should also be part of the assessment, if these ways are actually used by the household. Accessibility has to be evaluated according to the ease/difficulty to transfer and withdraw money, whether this is done by phone- banking and PC-banking or in a bank or post office. (3) Durables The possession of durables relates to the access of the specific product or service for the private use of the household. It can be rented or shared. If the product is shared, access to it should be easy and appropriate to household needs. (4) Basic needs (a) Shoes: this concept has to be understood in a broad sense. It could include boots, sandals, etc. according to the climatic conditions of the concerned country. 5. TRANSMISSION OF DATA TO EUROSTAT The target secondary variables on \u2018 material deprivation \u2019 should be sent to Eurostat in the household data file (H) and in the personal data file (P) after the target primary variables.

Data is sent as a set of records of which a large part describes the characteristics of the data (country, reference year, economic activity, geographical breakdown, etc.). The data itself is a number which can be linked to flags and explanatory footnotes used for adding explanations to data which give users additional information regarding for instance extreme year-to-year changes. One file shall be provided per series of data. Confidential data have to be sent with the true value being recorded in the value field and a flag indicating the nature of the confidential data being added to the record. Member States have to provide all levels of aggregation of the breakdowns as defined in Regulation (EC) No 716/2007. In addition, data has to contain all secondary confidentiality flags in accordance with the confidentiality rules existing at national level. Member States have to provide complete sets for all series of data to be provided including records for all data required by Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 which are not available, i.e. which are not collected in the Member State. Data for activities/phenomena not existing in the Member State should be marked in the record as zero (code \u2018 0 \u2019 in the value field). The code \u2018 0 \u2019 in the value field can also be used for activities that do exist but for which the data is small and as a result of rounding equals zero. Monetary data has to be expressed in thousands of national currency units (thousands of euros for the countries of the euro area). Countries acceding to the euro area shall report in euros instead of national currency monetary data due in the year of their accession. 2.

(2) The Employment Guidelines (2005-2008) adopted by Council Decision 2005/600/EC ( 2 ), the European Commission \u2019 s \u2018 Roadmap on equality between women and men \u2019 ( 3 ) and the European Pact for Gender Equality ( 4 ) encourage Member States to take measures to promote a better work-life balance for all in terms of childcare, care facilities for other dependents and the promotion of parental leave for both women and men. Therefore, to measure the impact of recent policies in this area, it would be essential to collect relevant infor- mation with the 2010 ad hoc module. (3) The Council Resolution of 17 June 1999 on equal opportunities for people with disabilities ( 5 ) refers to the need for a comprehensive and comparable dataset on the labour market situation of people with disabilities. Moreover, the Commission \u2019 s European Action Plan on equal opportunities for people with disabilities ( 6 ), which focuses on the active inclusion of people with disabilities, should be monitored. Therefore, this information should be collected through the ad hoc module for 2011. (4) There is a need for a comprehensive and comparable set of data on transitions from work into retirement in order to monitor progress towards the common objectives of the European Employment Strategy and of the open method of coordination in the area of pensions launched by the Laeken European Council in December 2001. Both processes identify the promotion of active ageing and prolongation of working life as priorities for action. Therefore, information on the labour market situation of older workers and the main factors influ- encing their labour market participation and transitions should be collected through the ad hoc module 2012. (5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 430/2005 of 15 March 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community concerning the codification to be used for data transmission from 2006 onwards and the use of a sub-sample for the collection of data on structural variables ( 7 ) sets out the characteristics of the sample to be used to collect information on ad hoc modules. (6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom ( 8 ), HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The programme of ad hoc modules for the labour force sample survey, covering the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, as set out in the Annex, is hereby adopted.

        "COMMISSION DECISION of 21 April 2008 derogating from certain provisions of Decision 2006/923/EC on a Community financial contribution for 2006 and 2007 to cover expenditure incurred by Portugal for the purpose of combating Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode) (notified under document number C(2008) 1444) (Only the Portuguese text is authentic) (2008/327/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community ( 1 ), and in particular Article 23(6) thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Decision 2006/923/EC ( 2 ) approved a financial contribution from the Community for a programme of measures introduced by Portugal aiming in 2006 and 2007 at controlling the spread of Bursaphe- lenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode) to other Member States. The measures consisted of the creation of a barrier free from all host trees of the pinewood nematode vector, hereinafter the \u2018 clear cut belt \u2019 . (2) Since the adoption of Decision 2006/923/EC, Portugal has faced several adverse and exceptional circumstances, leading to a delay in the execution of the measures. Those circumstances were explained in a letter from Portugal to the Commission dated 28 September 2007. In particular, whilst the initial programme was based on an estimate of 700 000 pine trees to be felled, it became necessary to fell 980 000 in total. In addition, 3 700 000 young pine trees had also to be eliminated. The Portuguese authorities explained the difference in the number of trees by the fact that the sole data available at that time, the national forest inventory from 1995, appeared to be outdated and underestimated young trees, isolated trees and trees located in broadleaf dominated mixed stands. (3) Notwithstanding the adverse circumstances, the Commission has verified by its missions in Portugal that the Portuguese authorities were able to meet the objectives laid down in Article 1 of Decision 2006/923/EC in an appropriate way. Inevitably the cumulative delays prevented them fully delivering the expected results within the strict deadline laid down in the Decision for the completion of the measures. Never- theless, the delays were not such as to prevent the measures from being deployed to their full effect and, due to the weather conditions in spring 2007 in Portugal, not favourable to the flying of the insect vector of the pinewood nematode, did not result in an increased phytosanitary risk. (4) Decision 2006/923/EC laid down penalties, in the form of progressive reductions of the Community financing, in case of non-implementation or late implementation of the measures. The application of such reductions and sanctions would be disproportionate given the excep- tional circumstances. (5) The documentation to be provided by Portugal has to be such that it enables the Commission to conclude that the conditions for the payment of the balance of the Community financial contribution laid down in Decision 2006/923/EC are met. As the exceptional circumstances faced by Portugal have also delayed the payments by Portugal to the private companies having executed the clear cut belt, the deadline for submitting the appropriate documentation should be extended. (6) The measures provided in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 1. By way of derogation from Article 4 of Decision 2006/923/EC, the balance of the Community financial contri- bution referred to in Article 2 of that Decision shall be paid once the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the measures necessary to the creation of a clear-cut belt as an area free from pinewood nematode vector hosts have been implemented by Portugal in an acceptable way and meet the objectives referred to in Article 1 of Decision 2006/923/EC; EN 24.4.2008 Official Journal of the European Union L 112/29 ( 1 ) OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
