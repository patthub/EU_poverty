Welcomes the role of the ECB in safeguarding euro stability; highlights that the statutory independence of the ECB, as laid down in the Treaties, is a prerequisite for it to fulfil its mandate, as well as to safeguard its democratic legitimacy; notes that independence requires that the ECB must not seek or take instructions from Union institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body; stresses that this independence must not be infringed on, and highlights moreover that central bank independence should always be complemented by a corresponding level of accountability; stresses that the TFEU states that, besides its primary mandate of maintaining price stability, the ECB must also support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union, as long as they are not in conflict with the primary mandate; underlines that sustainable development, convergence, full employment, and social progress are general objectives of the Union as defined in Article 3 TFEU; 2.

Is concerned, moreover, that the balance of risks to the growth outlook remains to the downside in a context of exceptional uncertainty where the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend on the duration and effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity, domestic demand and international supply chains are permanently affected; 6. Calls for an urgent re-evaluation of systemic risk in the financial sector following the pandemic; welcomes, in this regard, the establishment of a working board relating to the pandemic at the European Systemic Risk Board; advises that a qualitative assessment of idiosyncratic risk be included in future stress tests; 7. Welcomes the ECB\u2019s efforts at maintaining price stability; notes that the target for inflation has not been systematically attained and that further vigilance is needed; highlights that the euro area has registered deflation in the past months; highlights that deflation poses significant risks to the euro area economies, which might call for strong ECB intervention; 8. Welcomes the fact that the ECB is discussing the adaptation of its inflation measurements; notes that the HICP is a very narrow concept of inflation measurement which underestimates inflation in the euro area due to an inadequate share of housing costs in the HICP basket ( 3 ); calls for a re-adjustment of the basket to reflect the fact that European households spend 24 % of their income on housing-related expenditure; encourages the ECB to also take into account the asset price inflation caused inter alia by low interest rates; acknowledges the challenges to the transmission of monetary policy; 9. Acknowledges President Lagarde\u2019s strong call for \u2018full alignment of fiscal and monetary policies\u2019 as well as the commitment \u2018to use all the tools that will produce the most effective, efficient, and proportionate outcome\u2019 to support the euro area\u2019s economic recovery; underlines that there are strong complementarities between fiscal and monetary policies; welcomes the ECB\u2019s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme to support the economic recovery of the euro area; C 465/6 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 3 ) cf. \u2018Persistent low inflation in the euro area: Mismeasurement rather than a cause for concern?\u2019 (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/ RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/614214/IPOL_IDA(2018)614214_EN.pdf).

Welcomes the quick and substantial ECB monetary policy response to the COVID-19 crisis in a context of emergency; acknowledges the positive impact of this response on the economic situation of the euro area; expects that the ECB will maintain its support as long as it is needed; takes note of the statement of ECB Supervisory Board member Yves Mersch that such flexibility will not be extended to other operations; 11. Stresses that monetary policy alone will not suffice to achieve a sustainable economic recovery; emphasises that reforms that strengthen competitiveness and social cohesion are necessary to restore and enhance economic growth across the Union; believes that the potential of monetary policy alone to facilitate recovery is limited and, while respecting the independence of the ECB, calls on the ECB to study the possibility of using other policy measures that have the potential to stimulate the economy, within the confines of its mandate; stresses the spillover effects of a very accommodative monetary policy, such as the impact on savers or the risk of asset price inflation; warns Member States against taking the low-interest rate environment for granted, as a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the servicing of public debt; 12. Warns, however, against the risk of excessive valuations on bond markets, which risk being difficult to handle if interest rates start to rise again, particularly for countries involved in an excessive deficit procedure or those with high levels of debt; 13. Notes the importance of active monetary policy in alleviating the pressure of financial constraints on small and medium-sized enterprises; acknowledges that the percentage of SMEs facing financial constraints decreased from 18 % in 2009-12 to 8 % in 2016-19; underlines that the COVID-19 crisis is having a strong impact on SMEs; recognises the importance of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU; points out, in this respect, the need to encourage private and public investments as well as reforms, and calls, therefore, for further efforts to ensure the financing of the real economy; 14. Asks the ECB to monitor the proportionality of quantitative easing to the risks in its balance sheets, asset price inflation and the potential misallocation of resources; 15. Notes the impact of long-term low interest rates; underlines that low interest rates, on the one hand, offer opportunities to consumers, companies, including SMEs, workers and borrowers, who can benefit from stronger economic momentum, lower unemployment and lower borrowing costs; recognises the diverging distributional consequences of the ECB\u2019s policies; calls on the ECB to examine the impact of its policies on wealth inequality; regrets, on the other hand, the increase of unviable and highly indebted business, the reduced incentive for governments to pursue growth and sustainability-enhancing reforms, as well as detrimental effects on insurers and pension funds, and stresses the financial burden this places on many citizens across the Union; 16. Notes the linkage between monetary policy and increasing housing prices in the euro area; emphasises that the persistently high housing cost overburden rate of 9,6 % in 2018 is expected to increase due to the pandemic, and calls on the ECB to evaluate the regional and sectoral impact and the inter-generational fairness of its quantitative easing programme on the cost of living across the Union; 17. Understands that the severity of the crisis has forced the ECB to shift attention away from its monetary policy framework strategy review; takes note of President Lagarde\u2019s commitment during the monetary dialogue held on 28 September 2020 to interact closely with Parliament and to ensure regular dialogues; 18. Stresses that any monetary policy framework strategy review should acutely consider the nature of the European economy, which is increasingly services-bound and digitalised, and should assess the extent to which this impedes the transmission of monetary policies into the real economy; Actions against climate change 19. Notes, respecting the independence of the ECB, the impact of climate change on inflation dynamics and transmission risks in monetary policy; recalls the impact of the ECB in maintaining price stability; recalls that the ECB, as a European institution, is bound by the Paris Agreement; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/7 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",

Shares the ECB\u2019s concerns regarding the rapid growth of the non-bank financial sector, also known as shadow banking; stresses the need for adequate regulation in this field; stresses the need for the ECB to mitigate the systemic risk that arises due to the increasing number of non-bank regulated entities clustered around banks for access to their payments system; 29. Welcomes the ongoing efforts of the ECB to further strengthen its response and recovery capabilities in the event of a cyberattack on its own organisation; notes with concern the recent technical failures of the TARGET2 settlement system in October and November 2020; welcomes the subsequent investigation of these failures by the ECB and asks for disclosure of the results to Parliament; 30.

Calls on the ECB to explore ways of strengthening the international role of the euro, as this would increase the EU\u2019s ability to frame its policy stance independently vis-\u00e0-vis other global powers and is a key element in safeguarding European economic sovereignty; notes that making the euro more attractive as a reserve currency will further enhance its international use; underlines that strengthening the role of the euro requires the deepening of the European economic and monetary union; welcomes the repeated calls of the ECB for the completion of the banking union; stresses that the creation of a well-designed European safe asset could facilitate financial integration and help mitigate the negative feedback loops between sovereigns and the domestic banking sectors; C 465/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",

Expresses strong concern that only two of the 25 Members of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council are women, despite repeated calls from Parliament and from senior figures in the ECB, including its President Christine Lagarde, to improve gender balance in EU economic and monetary affairs nominations; emphasises that Executive Board Member nominations should be prepared carefully, with full transparency and together with Parliament in line with the Treaties; calls on the Council to draw up a gender-balanced shortlist for any upcoming vacancies and to share this with Parliament, thus allowing Parliament to play a more meaningful advisory role in the appointment process; regrets that no satisfactory progress has been made to date; recalls that the equal treatment of men and women is a constitutional principle that must be strictly adhered to; 36.

Points out the need for a coordinated, harmonised and coherent framework at EU level, based on more efficient assessment and follow-up mechanisms, that guarantees that the prevention of THB is strengthened, together with support, assistance and protection of its victims, and aiming for the complete elimination of trafficking, including through coordinated implementation with the rights conferred by the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive, the Residence Permit Directive, the Directive on the fight against sexual abuse and child pornography and the Compensation Directive ( 25 ), as trafficking is a crime with a cross-border dimension and thus cannot be dealt with at national level alone; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/35 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 24 ) Severe labour exploitation: workers moving within or into the European Union http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2015/severe- labour-exploitation-workers-moving-within-or-european-union ( 25 ) Council Directive 2004/80/EC of 29 April 2004 relating to compensation to crime victims (OJ L 261, 6.8.2004, p. 15).

Commends the good work done by the Commission in coordinating the EU\u2019s response to THB and developing knowledge and the findings on the various aspects of THB, including research into the gender dimension and the particular vulnerability of children; calls on the Commission to ensure the continuity of the work being done by appointing a full-time EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator with the relevant expertise and a clear mandate, working with a network of national representatives from the Member States and civil society to ensure consistent cooperation; 3. Stresses the importance of the funding of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), the Daphne Programme, the European Social Fund+ and Internal Security Fund (ISF) programmes to continue to be used for projects tackling THB, as well as using other available instruments, including EU programmes such as the citizens, equality, rights and values programme, financial instruments such as the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, and initiatives such as EMPACT, and the EU-UN Spotlight and Glo.ACT Initiatives; recalls the need for initiatives and projects related to the gender dimension of trafficking, and calls for a comprehensive policy review of EU-financed projects; calls on the Member States to ensure stable funding and adequate staff to identify and protect victims and expresses concern about the lack of adequate funding for victims\u2019 organisations, especially those providing support to women, which, owing to severe funding cuts, are struggling to continue providing services to victims; 4. Highlights that the lack of consistent, comparable and detailed data continues to hamper the adequate and evidence-based assessment of the scale of and trends in THB; calls on the Member States to increase their efforts in and funding for research, analysis and collection of data on all forms of THB, and to improve coordination among data sources at national and EU level, as well as the collection of more up-to-date, centralised and comprehensive data disaggregated by type of trafficking, age and gender, racial and ethnic origin, and including internally trafficked people, by compiling statistical information with due respect for the rights to privacy and personal data protection, in cooperation with the institutional actors involved, civil society, the EIGE and all relevant international organisations; calls on the Commission to regularly compile and publish such data for the EU; 5. Urges the Commission and the Member States to ensure differentiation between trafficking and smuggling, which require deeper analysis and different responses in law and policy; highlights that the confusion between them often leads to failings in correctly identifying victims and in ensuring that they can access protection measures and avoid secondary victimisation; 6. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to assess and evaluate the use of digital technologies, social media and internet services as the predominant tools used to recruit trafficking victims, and that they empower law enforcement authorities and civil society organisations in the fight against THB by providing them with the necessary technical knowledge and dedicated resources to respond to the challenges posed by the new technologies; further calls on them to adopt third-party liability rules for technology companies hosting exploitative material, to improve the legislative tools used in judicial proceedings and in the prosecution of traffickers, to promote the exchange of information and cooperation between the relevant authorities, internet service providers and social media companies, to promote public information campaigns across the EU on THB while respecting the victims\u2019 right to privacy and safety, as well as ensuring their fundamental rights and data protection, and to increase support for building transnational expertise and technology-based solutions, for example to block the recruitment of victims; 7. Urges the Commission and the Member States to make cyber-awareness a priority in campaigns aimed at schools, universities, companies and research bodies, and to build on existing expertise such as the Better Internet for Kids portal; underlines that awareness-raising in relation to online human trafficking on social media is essential to prevent new victims from entering into the trafficking networks; calls on the Commission to actively engage with platforms in developing common guidelines and action plans that prevent and combat online trafficking; Identification, protection, assistance and support to victims 8. Highlights that the early identification of victims remains one of the main challenges to implementation, and is one of the most crucial in terms of enabling victims to exercise their rights; calls on the Member States to protect them, to give more actors responsibility and awareness-raising opportunities for identifying victims of THB at all stages of the process, including representatives of civil society organisations, law enforcement officers, immigration and asylum officials, labour inspectors and social workers or healthcare staff, as well as other relevant professionals and actors; stresses the need for an approach based on the four key strategies of prevention, prosecution, victim protection and multi-level partnership; calls on C 465/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "all Member States to earmark adequate funds for the identification, protection, assistance and support of victims of THB at all stages; highlights that early identification should take into account the specificities of high-risk sectors and groups such as victims who are women and girls; 9. Calls on all Member States to effectively guarantee the rights of victims through legal assistance at the earliest possible stage, including accessible information about their legal rights, to protect and support them with a gender- and child-sensitive approach while ensuring complementarity with the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive; recalls that the Anti-Trafficking Directive obliges the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authorities are entitled not to prosecute or impose penalties on victims of THB for their involvement in criminal activities which they have been compelled to commit; 10. Regrets the lack of targeted protection programmes for vulnerable victims in many Member States; stresses the importance of providing measures for the special needs of victims in vulnerable situations and specific guidance to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation; highlights the need to ensure unconditional and individualised protection, assistance and support) to victims, also taking their direct dependants into account, including in the context of legal proceedings related to criminal, civil or other actions against traffickers or exploiters; calls for the effective implementation in all Member States of the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive and any related legislation, with a gender- and victim-based approach; recalls that people working to protect and help the victims of THB should not be criminalised for their work related to this; 11. Notes that the victims of THB require specialised services, including access to safe short- and long-term accommodation, witness protection schemes, healthcare and counselling, translation and interpretation services, legal redress, compensation, access to education and training, including being taught the language of their country of residence, access to the labour market and job placement, (re-)integration, resettlement assistance and individualised services, with a specific gender perspective; urges the Member States to ensure gender-specific, appropriate and targeted provision of services to victims of THB; 12. Regrets the fact that the specific needs of victims in vulnerable situations such as women, children, LGBTI people, persons with disabilities and people from racialised groups are often overlooked, and urges the Member States to ensure gender-specific services and support to victims appropriate to their needs; calls on the Member States to address in particular the needs of LGBTI people, as they are highly vulnerable to THB owing to the cumulative effect of different types of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity; 13. Points out the high vulnerability of Roma communities to all forms of trafficking and exploitation, especially of women and children, according to the Commission\u2019s three progress reports; calls on the Commission and the Member States to design specific measures to combat trafficking through the national Roma integration strategies for 2020-2030; calls on the Commission and the Member States to collect statistical data on the victims of trafficking based on their ethnic background; 14. Is concerned that victims of THB are often not adequately informed of their rights or of the assistance and support measures that are available to them; underlines the importance of having clear and consistent information for victims and for front line staff who may come into contact with victims; 15. Highlights that while the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet measurable, it is nevertheless clear that the crisis disproportionately affects the most vulnerable victims of THB, especially women, children and those in precarious situations, and that it has forced many shelters to close or suspend their services as a result of reported infections, leaving victims of trafficking without housing, healthcare, and legal assistance; in this context, stresses that access to care and social services should be guaranteed without discrimination; recalls that the root causes driving THB have been exacerbated by the pandemic, exposing vulnerable populations to higher risks of trafficking, increasing the number of online advertisements featuring victims of THB, of sexual predators targeting children, of cases of sexual exploitation online, and the demand for child pornography; calls on the Member States to take effective action with the support of civil society organisations and EU agencies such as Europol, which released a report entitled \u2018Pandemic profiteering: how criminals exploit the COVID-19 crisis\u2019 in March 2020; calls on the Commission to carry out a deeper analysis of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on potential victims of THB, and on the structure and functioning of THB in general, in order to create specific measures to eliminate THB; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/37 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "16. Points out the need for fully functioning, coherent National Referral Mechanisms (NRM) coordinated with transnational referral mechanisms and funded through specific dedicated financial allocations, to meet the challenges in coordinating different actors, and the shortcomings that lead to limited trust among victims, which may have a negative impact on effective referrals; underlines that good cooperation between the police and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) should be complementary to a fully fledged NRM defining the roles and responsibilities of all relevant actors ( 26 ) so as to protect and promote the fundamental rights of victims; encourages the Member States to set up national centres specialised in the support and reception of victims of THB and to facilitate direct and efficient cross-border cooperation between these centres, as well as between law enforcement agencies and the relevant EU agencies; 17. Calls on the Commission to monitor and assess the situation of compensation to victims in the Member States and across borders in terms of access, enforcement and actual payments, and to come forward with specific measures to ensure better, faster and free legal aid and access to compensation in all Member States without prejudice to other forms of reparation; 18. Welcomes the adoption of the establishment of the Mechanism for the Review of the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto in 2018 and the launch of its review process in 2020; calls on the Commission to position itself as a role model in this review process; underlines the importance of increasing the understanding of THB as a complex and evolving crime; calls on the Member States and the EU institutions to ensure that a human rights-based response remains at the core of the analysis of and the responses to THB, and recalls the need to engage with citizens and civil society organisations; stresses the important role played by the European Parliament and national parliaments; invites the Commission and the Member States to join the UN\u2019s international campaign against trafficking in persons; urges the Member States to ratify all relevant international instruments on THB, including the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; THB as a gendered crime and addressing trafficking for sexual exploitation 19. Highlights that sexual exploitation remains the most prevalent and reported form of trafficking in the EU since 2008, as 60 % of victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation; notes that 92 % of these victims are women and girls, and that more than 70 % of traffickers are male ( 27 ), reflecting how trafficking for sexual exploitation is rooted in gender inequalities; 20. Urges, therefore, the Member States to adopt specific measures to address gender-based violence, violence against women and minors, the social acceptance of violence and the culture of impunity, and structural gender inequalities and stereotypes as root causes of trafficking, especially through education, information and awareness-raising campaigns complemented with an exchange of best practices, including programmes and training courses to engage with men and boys; recommends that the Commission strengthen and develop the gender dimension in the monitoring of the implementation of EU anti-trafficking legislation and urges the Commission to continue to monitor this in its assessment of Member States\u2019 compliance with and implementation of the Anti-Trafficking Directive; 21. Calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to examine how the demand for sexual services drives trafficking, as Europol has reported that \u2018there are Member States where prostitution is legal, making it much easier for traffickers to use a legal environment in order to exploit their victims\u2019 ( 28 ); recalls Europol\u2019s finding that in some EU Member States where prostitution is legal, suspects were able to exploit children alongside adult victims ( 29 ); underlines that THB is fuelled by the high profits for traffickers and by the demand that encourages all forms of exploitation; stresses that the use of legal businesses as a cover for exploitative activities is quite common among human traffickers; recalls that Member States have a legal obligation to discourage and reduce the demand for all forms of exploitation, which should be a key target for prevention and prosecution efforts; C 465/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 26 ) The recommendations by the Council of Europe\u2019s Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) include ensuring the application of the NRM to asylum seekers and persons in immigration detention.

Calls on the Commission to prioritise the prevention of the crime of trafficking for sexual exploitation, including through information, awareness-raising and education campaigns, adopting measures and programmes to discourage and reduce demand, and to possibly adopt future dedicated legislation, and calls on the Member States to include the knowing use of the services of victims of trafficking as a criminal offence in their national statutes, as recommended by Article 18 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive and reiterated by the Commission in 2018 ( 30 ), and to provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties; urges the Member States to work closely with civil society organisations working with trafficked persons; 23. Urges the Member States and the Commission to focus on the recurring and emerging patterns of THB for sexual exploitation, such as the increasing exploitation of children and women, including through grooming and sextortion, and the use, among other things, of the \u2018lover boy\u2019 method as the most frequent means of recruiting victims and making them compliant by using online technologies, through developing digital skills, including online safety, in cooperation with all relevant actors; notes that the increased use of technology by criminal networks engaged in THB has significantly transformed their traditional modus operandi, especially during some stages of the trafficking process; 24. Highlights the importance of and asks for more gender- and child-sensitive training programmes for all officials, judges, stakeholders and actors dealing with trafficking cases, investigations, and potential victims to enhance the early identification of those who may be victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and encourages Member States to adopt measures to support victims, such as exit programmes, psychological support measures, decent social and professional reintegration opportunities, education and access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, access to justice and related rights, while involving civil society, the social partners and the private sector; underlines further, in this context, the importance of awareness-raising programmes for the general public in order to identify and protect potential victims; highlights the need to earmark adequate funds for training purposes and therefore calls for the Member States to provide adequate resources; 25. Urges the Member States to adopt comprehensive age- and developmentally appropriate sexuality education as a key means of preventing all forms of violence against women and girls, including trafficking and sexual exploitation, to include consent and relationships education promoting healthy attitudes of respect and equality in all interactions; Trafficking for labour exploitation 26. Strongly regrets the fact that several Member States and civil society organisations have reported an increase in trafficking for labour exploitation ( 31 ); deplores the fact that children have also increasingly fallen victim to trafficking for labour exploitation and calls for urgent action by national labour inspectorates in the Member States to detect and put an end to such practices; calls further on the European Labour Authority to address the issue of severe labour exploitation as a matter of priority and to support the Member States with capacity building on this matter with a view to better identifying and sanctioning severe labour exploitation practices through targeted inspections; highlights the importance of considering the inclusion of labour exploitation in the training programmes for officials attending victims to enhance the early identification of those who are victims of trafficking for forced labour; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to examine how the demand for cheap labour services drives trafficking for labour exploitation; urges the Member States\u2019 authorities to increase their efforts to eliminate all forms of informal and unregulated work, thereby ensuring labour rights for all workers; highlights that the precarious working status of the workers concerned makes them dependent on their employers, and allows the perpetrators of human trafficking to exploit their victims; Other forms of exploitation 27. Urges the Member States and the Commission to focus on the recurring and emerging patterns of all forms of THB, including for labour exploitation, forced begging, forced and sham marriage, and forced criminality, among other purposes; underlines that THB is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and by the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation; notes with concern that many EU Member States do not have adequate legislation for victims of all forms of exploitation; calls on the Member States to take into account all forms of trafficking when giving protection, assistance and support to victims; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/39 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 30 ) COM(2018)0777, p. 6.

        "notes that in spite of recent reports of criminal networks trafficking people across the EU for the purposes of labour and other forms of exploitation, adequate data, legislation and access to support services for victims of these forms of exploitation are nevertheless lacking; 28. Notes that trafficking for other forms of exploitation accounted for 18 % of victims ( 32 ), involving activities in the area of forced begging, forced criminalities, the selling of babies, organ removal, illegal adoption, financial exploitation through fraud and THB through surrogacy; points out that many of the victims of forced begging and forced criminality often come from marginalised Roma communities and are often children; 29. Emphasises that the EU\u2019s legal and policy framework on THB combines both the internal and external dimensions, recognising that action to combat trafficking, which is a serious crime and a human rights violation, constitutes a clear objective of the EU\u2019s external action; calls on the Commission and the Member States to enhance cooperation with third countries in order to combat all forms of THB and to strengthen opportunities for joint investigations and specialised prosecutions; THB in the context of asylum and migration 30. Emphasises that, while the majority of victims are EU nationals, criminal organisations have been misusing migration routes for trafficking victims into the EU, with humanitarian crises exacerbating the exposure of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers to traffickers; points out that there has been a sharp increase in recent years concerning the number of women and girls trafficked through the Central Mediterranean route for sexual exploitation in the EU ( 33 ); calls for the Member States and the EU to identify these women and girls and to prevent similar cases in the future by using a coherent and coordinated rights-based and gender- and child-sensitive approach to prevent and address human trafficking; recalls that women and children often become victims of sexual abuse along the migration route, in exchange for protection and basic sustenance; underlines that the criteria for these women and children to be granted the official status of THB victim are often too rigid to fulfil, and that they are therefore unable to receive the required assistance to address the harm that they face; 31. Reiterates that asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, and, in particular, unaccompanied and separated minors, are vulnerable to trafficking and that special attention should be given to the trafficking of women, children and other vulnerable groups; highlights that there are vulnerabilities and risks at the different stages in the migration process prior to migration itself, en route to the EU, at the destination and for those that might be returned; notes that limited knowledge of a local language and/or of understanding of their rights, limited access to viable livelihood opportunities or quality education, and restrictions on their freedom of movement also contribute to their risk of becoming victims of trafficking; 32. Highlights the very low number of registered THB victims in international protection procedures; calls on the Member States to strengthen the provision of information to arriving individuals, including with the help of translation and interpretation, on their rights and the applicable procedures under EU legislation, including on the possibilities for obtaining support through lawyers and cultural mediators working to prevent human trafficking and exploitation; 33. Points out that in some Member States, applicants for international protection who are identified as victims of THB might have decided, or been obliged, to change procedures and claim a residence permit under the Residence Permit Directive ( 34 ); calls on the Member States to ensure that the anti-trafficking and the asylum procedures are interconnected and complement each other; 34. Calls on the Member States to ensure a coherent application of the provisions set out in the Dublin III Regulation, the Anti-Trafficking Directive and the Residence Permit Directive to prevent the practice employed in some Member States of transferring victims of human trafficking to the country where they were exploited when they first arrived, thereby leaving them more exposed to the risk of being re-trafficked and re-traumatised; C 465/40 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 32 ) COM(2020)0661.

Calls on the Member States to step up their efforts to identify potential victims early on, in particular within migration flows and hotspots, and to adopt protection and prevention measures; highlights that potential victims who have been identified should be provided with protection and access to a safe place where they can be provided with information and legal aid; calls on the Member States to take action to ensure that all victims, including migrant victims, have access to justice irrespective of their residence status; 36. Calls on the Member States to provide adequate resources and specialised facilities for the actual and presumed victims of trafficking, including women, unaccompanied and separated minors, and to ensure sufficient places in shelters; calls on the Member States to ensure the presence of gender-trained staff in reception facilities and to provide adequate support and funding to civil society organisations working with them; 37. Calls on the Member States to ensure the right to family life of the victims of THB and to assess the potential extension of international protection granted to victims to their family members; calls on the Member States to speed up family reunification procedures for the family members of the victims at risk in the country of origin; 38. Points to the need to set up national mechanisms for data collection on THB victims in international protection procedures in order to be able to ensure follow-up in identified cases; 39. Is concerned that the recovery and reflection period is linked to cooperation by the victim during the investigation and is granted by law enforcement agencies; deplores the fact that in some Member States ( 35 ) the period is provided neither to victims of trafficking who are EU and/or EEA nationals nor to asylum seekers; calls on the Commission to monitor the implementation of available legal solutions at Member State level, in particular the granting of a recovery and reflection period; 40. Points out that, according to Europol, migrant smuggling and THB are sometimes carried out by the same criminal organisations ( 36 ) and investigations show that traffickers are increasingly targeting migrants and asylum seekers in the EU for exploitation ( 37 ); stresses the importance of prevention and the fight against THB when cooperating on working against smuggling with third countries, either of origin or of transit, together with the protection of the victims, ensuring comprehensive support, reintegration and rehabilitation programmes; 41. Reminds the Member States that the lack of safe and legal migration pathways for asylum seekers increases their vulnerability to trafficking as they can be exploited both during transit and upon arrival; calls on the Member States to provide more safe and legal routes for migration such as humanitarian visas in order to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable individuals; 42. Notes that being undocumented, or having dependent status, increases the likelihood of victimisation and reduces the likelihood that victims will seek help or report abuse owing to fear of immigration consequences, thereby putting them at risk of exploitation and abuse; notes that the significant gaps in the coverage and implementation of national laws and policies surrounding THB give perpetrators additional leverage to exploit victims with an irregular status, leaving large groups of people more vulnerable to exploitation; calls on the Member States to decouple migration enforcement actions from law enforcement activities; stresses that safe reporting and effective complaints mechanisms should be established for vulnerable persons; Trafficking of children 43. Notes that children constitute nearly a quarter of all victims in the EU, with girls (78 %) making up the vast majority of child victims in the EU; points out that nearly 75 % of all child victims in the EU were EU citizens; is particularly concerned about the violence, abuse and exploitation faced by child victims in the EU, especially those trafficked for sexual exploitation ( 38 ); 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/41 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 35 ) 9th General Report on GRETA\u2019s activities, p. 57.

Calls on the Member States to focus on identifying child victims and helping them to avail themselves of their rights; emphasises the need for well-trained and properly supported guardians, including temporary guardians as an emergency measure, to be appointed immediately for child victims, including unaccompanied child victims, and stresses the importance of child-friendly justice and specialist services; further calls for Member States to take measures to ensure adequate and appropriate training, in particular legal and psychological training, for those working with child victims of trafficking, and to increase the number of guardians by organising awareness campaigns; 46. Calls on Member States to ensure that consular staff pay particular attention to the correct verification of the identity of minors and the link with the person or persons exercising parental authority or legal guardianship when taking the minor\u2019s biometric data in the visa application procedure; calls on the Commission, in close cooperation with Europol and civil society organisations, and on the Member States to provide targeted and effective education and training, as well as information on the methods used by the traffickers, to national, local and regional authorities in order to prevent child trafficking; 47. Calls on the Member States to fully implement the Directive on the fight against sexual abuse and child pornography, and to reinforce police and judicial cooperation to prevent and combat sexual exploitation at EU level; urges the Member States to cooperate with civil society organisations and EU agencies, in particular with Europol and Eurojust, to step up information exchanges and to support cross-border investigations; 48. Notes with great concern the prevalence of child sexual abuse, and the pattern and normalisation of the trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, and calls for an adequate response by online platforms to avoid abusive material involving children becoming available; 49. Notes the use of means such as the internet and social media to recruit and attract potential victims; calls for special attention by the internet platforms to develop adequate tools; calls for the new Digital Services Act to address this use of cyber-violence methods; calls on the Member States to develop a model of identification, early support and assistance for children who are victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as awareness-raising programmes and child-friendly reporting mechanisms; encourages the Commission and the Member States to take further action in fighting these online crimes and to reinforce preventive measures; therefore reiterates the need to improve cross-border collaboration and exchange among law enforcement and child protection authorities, as well as to develop rapid family tracing and alternative care arrangements for unaccompanied minors; 50. Points out that child victims need specific support, taking into account their best interests and specific vulnerabilities; encourages the Member States to ensure that professionals who come into contact with child victims, such as law enforcement staff, border guards, civil servants, the judiciary, and social and health workers, including those who work in youth care facilities, are sufficiently trained in identifying, supporting and referring child victims of THB; notes that specialised teams within law enforcement, trained in the audio-visual recording of child testimonies, are not consistently involved in the questioning of all child victims of THB; urges the Member States to make this standard practice and to train law enforcement staff in this type of child-friendly questioning; advises the Member States to develop a strong \u2018chain approach\u2019, with close links between specific THB support, such as specialised centres for the support and reception of THB victims, and mainstream youth care modules, while responding to the specific needs of every child THB victim; 51. Notes that Roma children are especially vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking and are at high risk of being subjected to sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and forced begging; 52. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s decision to include in the EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse of 24 July 2020 the possibility of creating a European Centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse, as called for C 465/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",

Notes that children in migration, and, in particular, unaccompanied and separated migrant children, continue to be at high risk of violence, trafficking and exploitation along migration routes, en route to and within the EU; notes that girls are at risk of sexual exploitation and gender-based violence throughout the migration routes; requires the Member States to provide unaccompanied child victims of trafficking with assistance, support and protection measures that meet their specific needs, to assign them a guardian upon arrival, and to provide them with proper and adapted living conditions; recalls that such measures should take into account the best interests of the unaccompanied children from a short-term, as well as a long-term perspective; condemns the fact that some Member States have been using detention as a means of \u2018protection\u2019 for unaccompanied minors, including in police cells; recalls that the Member States should examine alternatives to detention, in particular of children; recalls that detention is not in the best interests of the child and that Member States should provide non-custodial child-friendly accommodation; 54. Notes that traffickers have frequently used reception centres to identify potential victims and to arrange for them to be transported to places of exploitation, and that the relevant public authorities and other competent actors in the Member States must therefore be particularly vigilant and monitor and safeguard these centres, paying specific attention to the most vulnerable, such as children, while reinforcing their protection by, at the same time, informing and empowering them by raising awareness in schools, youth centres and youth movements; stresses that a coordinated European approach is necessary to find and protect unaccompanied migrant children when they go missing; Efficiency of criminal justice systems and criminalisation of the use of services of victims 55. Notes the low number of prosecutions and convictions for the crime of trafficking; urges the Member States to take measures to improve and speed up the investigation of trafficking cases, through strengthened police efforts both nationally and transnationally, and to put in place strong criminal sanctions for the crime of human trafficking; emphasises that the existing national sanctions and the means of their execution still differ considerably between Member States; highlights that special attention should be paid to under-reported and under-investigated areas, especially employment of a seasonal and temporary nature in the low-skilled and low-paid sectors, such as labour exploitation in the agricultural sector; calls on the Member States to counter impunity through a coordinated approach between the relevant EU agencies in partnership with Member States, the EU institutions, civil society organisations and other partners, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions, including by effective use of the existing platforms run by agencies such as Europol and Eurojust; calls, therefore, on the competent authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crime, including cases of THB, to use large-scale IT systems, including the Schengen Information System (SIS II), in accordance with the provisions enshrined in the relevant legislation in order to support them; 56. Points out that not all Member States have introduced legislation relevant to Article 18 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive ( 39 ); notes that the differing legal landscapes on criminalising the use of services exacted from victims hampers efforts to reduce demand; regrets the fact that prosecution and conviction rates in the EU for knowingly using victims\u2019 services and for sexual exploitation are low; reiterates its urgent call on the Member States to establish the act of knowingly using the services of victims of human trafficking as a criminal offence; 57. Underlines the crucial importance for the EU law enforcement community of developing efficient and expanded analytical capabilities in response to the ever-increasing online-facilitated THB criminal patterns; calls on the Commission to provide financial support to EU agencies such as Europol and through dedicated EU sectoral funds such as the ISF to Member States to secure the highest analytical standards and adequate tools in order to process increasingly complex amounts of information; 58.

        "59. Regrets the fact that the conditions for a victim to receive the official status of THB victim are often too rigid to fulfil, especially for minors and other vulnerable victims who are financially and emotionally dependent on their traffickers; deplores the fact that victims are still subject to criminal charges and convictions for offences they have been compelled to commit, often in relation to the illegal entry into a Member State\u2019s territory, which is often inherent to being trafficked; calls on the Member States to adopt clear provisions on the non-prosecution or non-punishment of THB victims and on decoupling victims\u2019 protection from cooperation with law enforcement agencies, which currently puts the complete burden of proof on the victim; requests that the Member States instead fulfil victims\u2019 needs as regards psychological support; calls further on the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that assistance and support for a victim are not made conditional on the victim\u2019s willingness to cooperate in the criminal investigation, prosecution or trial in accordance with Article 11 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive; 60. Deplores the fact that data on the identity of THB victims appear in police reports and throughout proceedings, making it hard for victims to speak out or to be protected from retaliation; encourages the Member States to keep victims\u2019 names and other identity data in separate files accessible to the police and the prosecution, but not to be disclosed to the suspected traffickers or their lawyers, while respecting the right to a fair trial; 61. Stresses the importance of financial investigation and \u2018following the money\u2019 as a key strategy for investigating and prosecuting the organised crime networks that profit from THB; calls on the Member States to launch financial investigations and work with money laundering specialists when starting a new trafficking investigation; calls on Member States to strengthen cooperation in freezing and confiscating the assets of individuals involved in trafficking and in providing compensation to victims, including by using confiscated proceeds to support victims\u2019 assistance and protection, as encouraged by Recital 13 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive; calls on the Commission to assess and promote the use of existing judicial and police cooperation, and the available tools, such as mutual recognition of court judgments, joint investigation teams and the European investigation order; in this regard, calls for an enhanced holistic approach which seeks to increase joined-up thinking across all sectors, such as migration, employment, workplace health and safety, and many other sectors; Cooperation between Member States and with EU Agencies 62. Recalls the role of EU agencies in the early identification of victims and the fight against THB; calls for more resources for the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Agencies to enable their staff to be trained and capacity-building instruments to be developed in the area of detecting victims, including the appointment of adequately trained staff in gender- and child-sensitive approaches, especially in Member States faced with increased mixed migration flows; calls on the Commission to develop guidelines to mainstream gender and human rights expertise in the activities of law enforcement authorities across the EU, including by developing sustained programmes of improving gender balance in decision-making processes and in the staffing of the JHA agencies, particularly those relevant to THB; 63. Welcomes the conclusion by JHA agencies of the Joint Statement of Commitment to working together against trafficking in human beings; calls, in this regard, for the Member States to increase cross-border cooperation and knowledge sharing with the relevant EU agencies such as Eurojust, Europol, the FRA, Frontex, CEPOL, the EIGE and the EASO in the fight against THB; 64. Points out the vital role played by Eurojust in the cooperation and coordination of complex investigations and prosecutions among judicial authorities in the Member States, including through the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order, as well as through the use of Joint Investigative Teams; calls on the Member States to ensure more and timely referrals of THB cases to Eurojust in order to enhance the coordination of judicial investigations and prosecutions between Member States and with third countries; encourages the increased use of Joint Investigation Teams with the support of Eurojust and Europol, as this judicial cooperation tool has proven to be particularly effective in the fight against THB; 65. Encourages the Member States to increase the exchange of data and information to fight trafficking against human beings by using Europol\u2019s relevant resources and databases; 66.

Calls on the Commission to revise the Anti-Trafficking Directive after a thorough impact assessment in order to improve the measures for the prevention, tackling and prosecution of all forms of trafficking, especially for sexual exploitation as the largest area of THB; to address the use of online technologies in both the proliferation and the prevention of THB; to improve measures for prevention and the early identification of victims and easy and unconditional access to assistance and protection, while strengthening a horizontal gender- and child-sensitive perspective across all forms of trafficking; 68. Calls on the Commission to amend the Anti-Trafficking Directive with a view to ensuring that Member States explicitly criminalise the knowing use of all services provided by victims of trafficking which involve exploitation, as suggested by Article 18 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive, given the serious and extensive nature of this crime across the EU and the low number of prosecutions; regrets the fact that proving knowledge in using the services of a victim of human trafficking is a difficult matter for the prosecution authorities; stresses that the difficulty of finding evidence is not necessarily a conclusive argument for not treating a given type of conduct as a criminal offence; notes that restricting criminal liability only to the situation where the user has direct and actual knowledge that the person is a victim of human trafficking creates a very high threshold for achieving prosecutions; considers that the level of knowledge that should be required for this offence should be a matter for close examination; considers that the user should demonstrate that all reasonable steps were taken to avoid the use of services provided by a victim; is concerned about the fact that law enforcement has insufficient knowledge of the knowing use of services provided by victims of trafficking, the lack of judicial practice of the relevant provision and the insufficient and inadequate human resources deployed; stresses the importance of Member States strengthening efforts to increase the number of investigations and prosecutions, and reducing the burden placed on victims and their testimonies during proceedings for evidence gathering; calls for regular and tailor-made training for investigators, prosecutors and judges, and for the systematic use of financial investigations and other effective intelligence-led investigative tools, which can provide a range of types of evidence to be used in addition to victims\u2019 testimonies; calls on the Member States to dedicate sufficient financial and human resources to properly address this crime; 69. Calls on the Commission to publish a specific and dedicated EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings without further delay, to address THB in the EU as a priority area, and through a comprehensive, gender- and child-specific and victim-centred legal and policy framework; 70. Recalls that the Anti-Trafficking Directive needs to be fully implemented and consistently and diligently applied by all actors in the field, including legislators, judges, prosecutors, police and public administrations; stresses that the proper training of all these actors is essential, as are preventive awareness-raising campaigns and cooperation between public administrations and civil society organisations; urges the Commission and the Member States to step up efforts in this direction; 71. Calls on the Commission to regularly assess and review the implementation of the Anti-Trafficking Directive by the Member States and submit a report in line with Article 23(1), assessing the extent to which the Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with that Directive and the impact of existing national law, and to introduce urgently infringement procedures where there has been a lack of effective implementation, report to the European Parliament and to come forward with proposals to revise it; 72. Calls on the Commission to assess a review of the Residence Permit Directive with a view to ensuring that victims are not returned on the expiry of the reflection period and that residence permits for trafficked persons are not made conditional on the participation or willingness to participate of the trafficked person in the investigation or criminal proceedings of the case; calls on the Member States to ensure that the unconditional access to assistance and support mandated by the Anti-Trafficking Directive is reconciled with the Residence Permit Directive and its application; 73. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to define, allocate and earmark adequate funds in the battle against THB, either at national or European level, through the funding possibilities provided by European funds and projects, such as the Asylum, Migration and Integrational Fund (AMIF), the ISF and the Daphne strand of the citizens, equality, rights and values programme in the new multiannual financial framework; 74.

Emphasises the importance of a coherent approach to improve the identification of potential victims in the context of migration flows and in the hotspots, of improving access to asylum procedures and of ensuring their complementarity with the procedures related to trafficking; calls on the Commission to assess the implementation of the Anti-Trafficking Directive and to come forward with proposals to revise it; 78. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take urgent measures against criminal groups active in migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings, given the likelihood of smuggled persons becoming victims of trafficking, and to assess the risk faced by migrants and the most vulnerable, especially unaccompanied minors, separated children and women; underlines, in this context, the need for more legal and safe routes for migration in order to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable people with irregular status; 79. Calls on the Member States, as a response to COVID-19, to elaborate a contingency plan in order to ensure the minimum functioning of anti-trafficking systems in emergency conditions; notes that the contingency plan should ensure a minimum package of services available to the victims to meet their immediate needs during the period of reduced opportunities for referral, protection, investigation of the case and court proceedings; 80. Calls on the Commission to ensure the continuity of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator\u2019s work by appointing a full-time EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, and to include this in the new strategy on THB; o o o 81.

Notes that the Commission has conducted stakeholder consultations as well as exchanges with Parliament and the Member States in preparation of the New Pact on Asylum and Migration; highlights however that, despite its legal reporting obligation and the requirements stemming from the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law Making, the Commission has never presented an implementation report on the APD, and that in 2016 and 2020 it presented proposals for an Asylum Procedures Regulation without providing for any impact assessment; expects the Commission to present this report, which has been overdue since 2017; 2. Reiterates the importance of an evidence-based approach to guide coherent policy-making; 3. Notes that monitoring and statistical data are essential for ensuring compliance with EU law; calls on Member States to collect statistics on: (i) the number of applications considered in border procedures and the category of applicants concerned; (ii) the types of grounds applied for using the border procedure and their frequency; (iii) the outcomes of border procedures, both at first instance and appeal, and (iv) the number and categories of persons not channelled into the border procedure; Scope 4. Highlights that border procedures currently constitute exceptions to the legally defined rule that asylum applicants have a right to enter the territory of a Member State; notes that many applications for international protection are made at the border or in a transit zone of a Member State prior to a decision on the entry of the applicant; notes that in those cases Member States may provide for border procedures only in the cases exhaustively set out in the Articles 31(8) and 33 of the APD and in accordance with the basic principles and guarantees of Chapter II of the APD; notes that the transposition and application of border procedures under the APD varies between Member States, resulting in a lack of uniformity across the EU; takes note that most Member States apply border procedures only in a small number of cases, and that several Member States generally refrain from using border procedures; highlights, however, that three out of the seven Member States examined in the EPRS European Implementation Assessment apply border procedures beyond the grounds provided for in Article 43 of the APD, and calls on them to refrain from doing so; calls, furthermore, on Member States to refrain from applying border procedures at internal borders; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/49 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",

Recalls that border procedures entail the examination of an asylum application at the border or in a transit zone before a decision on entry to the territory of a Member State; reiterates that the refusal of entry under the Schengen Borders Code must be without prejudice to the application of special provisions concerning the right of asylum and to international protection; notes that, therefore, Member States have an obligation to assess whether an asylum applicant is in need of protection; 7. Notes, further, that under Article 9(1) of the APD applicants must be allowed to remain in the territory of the Member States, including at the border or in the transit zones where the application for international protection has been made; 8. Points out that the fact that an applicant has not legally entered the territory of the Member State while actually remaining on that territory is a legal fiction; highlights that this legal fiction impacts solely on the right to entry and stay, but does not mean that the applicant is not under the jurisdiction of the Member State concerned; 9. Highlights that applicants subject to border procedures are likely to be placed in detention during the examination of their asylum application; points out, further, that all Member States examined in the European Implementation Assessment by the EPRS detain asylum applicants in the framework of border procedures; 10. Reiterates that as stipulated in the RCD Member States must not hold a person in detention for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant, and that applicants may be detained only under very clearly defined exceptional circumstances; recalls its joint provisional agreement with the Council on the recast RCD that specifies that Member States shall not detain an applicant on the basis of her or his nationality; stresses that the RCD stipulates that detention must remain a measure of last resort, last only for as short a period as possible, and only for as long as the grounds set out in Article 8(3) of the RCD are applicable, and that persons detained must be given an opportunity to appeal against their deprivation of liberty; reiterates that the right to liberty as laid down in Article 6 of the Charter and Article 5 of the ECHR also applies at the EU\u2019s borders; regrets that hardly any alternatives to detention have been developed and applied in border procedures, and encourages Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that alternatives to detention are available; 11. Is concerned that some Member States detain asylum applicants in border procedures without a relevant legal basis for detention under border procedures in national law, as this can result in insufficient safeguards; stresses that if Member States choose to resort to detention, they should provide a legal basis for it in national law; 12. Recalls that in Joined Cases C-924/19 PPU and C-925/19 PPU, the CJEU ruled that even if an applicant can leave a transit zone in the direction of a third country, this situation can qualify as detention; 13. Is deeply concerned about reports of severe human rights violations and deplorable detention conditions in transit zones or detention centres in border areas; calls on the Member States to ensure dignified reception conditions in border facilities in line with the standards of the RCD; recalls in this regard that applicants who are in detention should be treated with full respect for their human dignity; 14. Recalls that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration for Member States when applying the APD, in accordance with the Charter and the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; notes that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has clarified that children should never be detained for immigration reasons; reiterates its position on APR that minors should never be detained as part of border procedures, and that the border procedure may only be applied to minors where there is an alternative available to their detention; calls on Member States currently applying the border procedure to minors to put in place alternatives to detention in accordance with the best interests of the child; calls on Member States to only apply border procedures where such non-custodial alternatives are in place; C 465/50 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "Refusal of entry and monitoring 15. Highlights the recent findings by the FRA, in particular that the number of alleged incidents of fundamental rights violations reported at external borders have increased significantly in recent years; notes that this includes many cases of persons being refused entry without their asylum claims being registered, including in the context of border procedures; reiterates that Member States are obliged to prevent unauthorised border crossings, and recalls that this obligation is without prejudice to the rights of persons requesting international protection; concurs with the FRA that the regularity and seriousness of these alleged incidents constitute a serious fundamental rights concern; reiterates that automatic refusal of entry, refoulement and collective expulsions are prohibited under EU and international law; highlights furthermore that, under Article 8 of the APD, Member States have a duty to inform persons on the possibility to apply for asylum if there are indications of protection needs, and that persons subject to a refusal of entry must be ensured access to an effective remedy in accordance with EU law and the ECHR; deplores all cases where Member States fail to respect their obligations in this regard, and calls on them to fully comply with those obligations; calls on the Commission to effectively ensure Member States\u2019 compliance with these obligations, including by suspending EU payments in cases of serious deficiencies; 16. Considers it important to establish an independent monitoring mechanism, and calls on the Member States to grant monitoring bodies unimpeded access to border facilities to ensure the effective protection of fundamental rights and the systematic reporting of violations, in line with the FRA\u2019s recommendations in its report on Fundamental Rights Issues at Land Borders; believes that independent monitoring should also verify the quality of the decision-making process and its outcome, as well as detention conditions and compliance with procedural safeguards; considers that independent and competent national human rights institutions and NGOs, EU agencies such as the FRA, as well as international organisations such as UNHCR should be part of the monitoring bodies; Unaccompanied minors and vulnerable applicants in need of special procedural guarantees in the border procedure 17. Notes that Article 24 of the APD specifies that Member States shall assess within a reasonable period of time after an application for international protection is made whether the applicant is an applicant in need of special procedural guarantees, and that they must not apply the border procedure if such guarantees cannot be provided within its framework; 18. Stresses that while Member States have established mechanisms to identify applicants in need of special procedural guarantees, these are often not effective in detecting such needs and, when needs are identified, often assess only visible needs; notes that effective and swift identification of applicants in need of special procedural guarantees remains a challenge; highlights that vulnerable persons are entitled to have their needs of special procedural guarantees assessed, and, if border procedures are applied to them, to have adequate support provided under EU law; calls on Member States to ensure that all applicants in need of special procedural guarantees are effectively identified and granted full access to these special guarantees and support, as stipulated in the RCD; stresses that where adequate support cannot be provided within the framework of the border procedure, or where the determining authority considers that the applicant is in need of specific procedural guarantees paying particular attention to victims of torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical, sexual violence or gender-based violence, the determining authority must not apply, or must cease to apply, these procedures to the applicant; 19. Recalls that Article 25(6)(b) of the APD prescribes a limited set of circumstances allowing Member States to process unaccompanied minors\u2019 applications in a border procedure; highlights that the Member States examined have not put in place adequate age assessment methods; calls on Member States to ensure compliance with the best interests of the child, as well as to protect children, including victims of trafficking; highlights that the APD provides Member States with the option to exempt unaccompanied minors from the border procedure, and to process their applications accordingly under the regular asylum procedure; calls on Member States to exempt unaccompanied minors from border procedures; Procedural safeguards 20. Notes that border procedures are fast-track procedures and recalls that, under Article 43 of the APD, applicants in border procedures enjoy the same rights and guarantees as applicants in normal procedures; 21. Highlights that significant problems regarding access to and the quality of legal assistance were reported in all the Member States examined; stresses that legal assistance is key to ensuring fair asylum procedures; recommends that free legal assistance should already be guaranteed at first instance, as soon as the asylum application is registered; calls on Member States to also provide effective access to legal assistance in practice, and to ensure the availability of sufficient and qualified legal advisers; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/51 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "22. Notes that the APD provides Member States with the option to allow NGOs access to the border procedure to provide assistance to applicants; regrets that, within the framework of border procedures, many Member States do not regulate such access for specialised non-governmental organisations at border facilities, crossing points and transit zones, which can play a key role in securing the applicant\u2019s legal and procedural rights, and improve the quality of first instance decisions; 23. Stresses that border procedures are characterised by a combination of short procedural time limits and detention; considers efficient procedural time limits necessary in order to minimise the temporary deprivation of freedom of movement if people are detained; recalls that Member States can introduce shorter, but reasonable, time limits, without prejudice to an adequate and complete examination being carried out and to the applicant\u2019s effective access to basic guarantees and principles provided for in the APD; notes that the time limit for a decision in a border procedure varies among Member States from two days to 28 days, and for lodging an appeal from two days to seven days; points out that short time limits can be challenging for thorough preparation of the interview or an appeal and hence for a fair application of the procedure, certainly if the procedural safeguards enshrined in the APD are not effectively applied; 24. Reiterates the obligations of Member States on providing applicants access to assistance, representation and procedural information, as stipulated under the APD; stresses the need for applicants to have timely access to adequate and comprehensible information about border procedures and their rights and obligations; points out that interpretation should be provided in person and at all stages of the border procedure; recalls that personal interviews are a corollary of the Member States\u2019 obligation to give applicants an effective opportunity to present the grounds for their applications and key elements for the examination procedure, and must be conducted by adequately trained personnel; stresses that applicants should be provided with a sufficient amount of time to prepare the interview; notes with concern that the Member States examined in the EPRS European Implementation Assessment do not fulfil their obligations under the APD related to procedural safeguards in the context of border procedures, and stresses that the difficulties of applicants in accessing procedural safeguards can have serious repercussions on their rights guaranteed in the Charter; calls on Member States to implement and apply the safeguards enshrined in the APD in full; 25. Acknowledges that the APD leaves to the Member States\u2019 discretion whether appeals have an automatic suspensive effect; recalls, however, that the CJEU has recognised that an appeal against a return decision, whose enforcement may expose the third country national concerned to a serious risk of refoulement, must have a suspensive effect; Border procedures and large numbers of arrivals 26. Notes that in accordance with Article 43(3) of the APD, in the event of arrivals involving a large number of third country nationals or stateless persons lodging applications for international protection at the border or in a transit zone, those procedures may also be applied where and for as long as these third-country nationals or stateless persons are accommodated normally at locations in proximity to the border or transit zone; 27. Recalls that the safeguards laid down in Chapter II of the APD also apply in the case of large numbers of arrivals; considers sufficient staff and resources essential in this respect; notes with concern that in these cases, the correct application of border procedures can be challenging, may create a risk of fundamental rights violations, and raise efficiency concerns; 28. Shares the concerns expressed by the FRA, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants about respect for procedural guarantees and fundamental rights in fast-track border procedures that have been used on the Greek hotspots; regrets the serious fundamental rights gaps existing in those European hotspots identified by the FRA; 29. Notes that EU agencies can support Member States in the event of arrivals involving a large number of asylum seekers at border entry points to ensure a fast and fair procedure for all applicants; notes in particular that EASO can give operational support at various steps of the asylum procedure, and that Frontex can help with screening, identification and fingerprinting; notes that so far EASO has provided assistance only in Greece in the framework of the so-called fast-track border procedure for islands; points out, furthermore, that improvements have been made, but that serious deficiencies still persist, such as an average length of several months for border procedures; hopes that the planned EU Asylum Agency will contribute to addressing these deficiencies; C 465/52 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "Application of border procedures 30. Recalls that the application of border procedures remains at the discretion of Member States; reiterates that if Member States apply border procedures, they should provide for conditions which ensure a fair and adequate procedure as well as swift clarity on its outcome to applicants for international protection; notes that particularly in more complex cases, the effectiveness of procedural guarantees, such as the right to legal assistance, can be undermined; stresses that efficient procedures and procedural safeguards need to go hand in hand; highlights that where a decision cannot be taken within four weeks at the latest, the application is to be processed in accordance with the other provisions of the APD; calls on Member States to fully comply in law and in practice with the procedural safeguards stipulated in the APD; 31. Calls on Member States to continuously exchange best practices on the correct application of the current border procedures and also share them with the Commission; 32. Calls on Member States to critically assess whether their current operational capacity is sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of their obligations in border procedures; calls on Member States to enhance operational cooperation and assistance where necessary; 33. Calls on the Commission to effectively monitor the implementation of Article 43 and the related provisions of the APD and to take action in the event of non-compliance, including by launching infringement proceedings where appropriate; o o o 34.

Is resolutely determined in its endeavour to bring citizens closer to its decision-making process; emphasises that transparency and accountability are fundamental to retain citizens\u2019 trust in the EU\u2019s political, legislative and administrative activities; stresses that Article 10(3) TEU recognises participatory democracy as one of the main democratic principles of the EU, thereby highlighting that decisions must be taken as close to the citizens as possible; recalls that fully democratic and highly transparent decision-making at European level is indispensable to increase citizens\u2019 trust in the EU institutions; emphasises the necessity for all the institutions of the EU to move forward with a similar level of transparency; 2. Notes with satisfaction the designation of a Commissioner responsible for transparency with a mission to introduce greater transparency into the legislative process in the European institutions; 3. Recalls that Parliament represents the interests of European citizens in an open and transparent manner with the aim of keeping them fully informed, as confirmed by the Ombudsman, and takes note of the progress made by the Commission in improving its transparency standards; is deeply concerned by the fact that despite the calls and recommendations of the Parliament and the Ombudsman, the Council has not yet implemented comparable standards and the decision-making process in the Council is far from transparent; calls on the Council to implement the relevant CJEU rulings in practice and not to circumvent them; appreciates the good practices of certain Council presidencies and also of certain Member States in publishing Council documents, including Council presidency proposals; 4. Welcomes the decision of the Council of the EU, further to the opening by the Ombudsman of case 1011/2015/TN, to apply Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 to documents held by its General Secretariat in relation to tasks of support to various intergovernmental bodies and entities, such as the opinions of the panel in question regarding the candidates\u2019 suitability to perform the duties of Judge and Advocate-General at the Court of Justice and the General Court of the EU; salutes the Ombudsman\u2019s opinion that greater openness is to be favoured regarding the issue of how to strike the correct balance between the need to protect the personal data of persons being assessed for high public office with the need to ensure maximum transparency in relation to the process of making appointments to high public office; 5. Regrets the recurrent practice of the Commission in providing an often only very limited amount of information on the implementation of EU legislation to Parliament; calls for the institutions to respect the principle of sincere cooperation and proactively publish this information; expresses regret at the Commission\u2019s refusal to publish statistics indicating the effectiveness of EU policies, which hinders any public scrutiny of policies with a significant impact on fundamental rights; calls on the Commission to be more proactive in publishing such statistics in order to prove that policies are necessary and proportionate to achieving their objective; calls on the Commission to be transparent as regards contracts with third parties; calls on the Commission to be more proactive in publishing as much information as possible about the tender processes compared to its current practices; 6. Stresses the importance of the measures taken to enhance the transparency of decisions taken in infringement procedures; calls, in particular, for documents sent by the Commission to Member States in connection with such procedures, and the related replies, to be made accessible to the public; 7. Stresses that international agreements are legally binding and have an impact on EU legislation, and underlines the need for negotiations to be transparent throughout the entire process; recalls that according to Article 218 TFEU, Parliament must be fully and immediately informed at every stage while negotiations are taking place; calls on the Commission to step up its efforts and to ensure full compliance with Article 218 TFEU; C 465/56 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",

Deeply regrets the fact that the Commission and Council insist on in camera meetings without proper justification; considers that requests for in camera meetings should be properly evaluated; calls for clear criteria and rules governing requests for in camera sessions in the EU institutions; 9. Points out that transparent law-making is of the utmost importance to citizens and is an important way to ensure their active participation in the law-making process; welcomes the 2016 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making (IIA), and the commitment therein by the three institutions to ensure the transparency of legislative procedures on the basis of relevant legislation and case law, including an appropriate handling of trilateral negotiations; 10. Urges the institutions to continue discussions on moving towards the establishment of a dedicated and user-friendly joint database on the state of play of legislative files (Joint Legislative Database) as agreed in the IIA on Better Law-Making to ensure greater transparency; 11. Welcomes the initiatives already launched which address public demands for more transparency, such as the Interinstitutional Register of Delegated Acts launched in December 2017 as a joint tool of Parliament, the Commission and the Council giving access to the whole lifecycle of delegated acts; 12. Points out that the transparency of the comitology procedures and the accessibility of the comitology register should be further increased and that changes to its content should be made in order to ensure greater transparency concerning the decision-making process; underlines that improving the search functions of the register to allow searches by policy area should be an essential constituent of this process; 13. Welcomes the new Code of Conduct for the Commission\u2019s members, which entered into force in February 2018, and which increases transparency primarily in relation to the meetings held between the Commissioners and interest representatives, as well as to the costs of the business travel of individual Commissioners; regrets the fact that the Council has still not adopted a code of conduct for its members and urges the Council to adopt such a code without further delay; insists that the Council must be as accountable and transparent as the other institutions; 14. Recalls its revised Rules of Procedure according to which Members are invited to adopt the systematic practice of only meeting interest representatives that have registered in the Transparency Register; also recalls that Members are invited to publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency Register, while rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and committee chairs are obliged, for each report, to publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency Register; points out in this context, however, that elected representatives are free to meet with anyone they consider relevant and important for their political work, without restrictions; 15. Considers that the current way of finding information about the voting patterns of Members of the European Parliament, via PDF files covering hundreds of votes on Parliament\u2019s website, is not user-friendly and does not contribute to the EU\u2019s transparency; calls for a user-friendly system whereby for each roll-call vote the text voted on and the voting results can be filtered by group and by MEP, and therefore visible at the same time; 16. Welcomes the fact that the negotiations on the Commission proposal for an IIA on a mandatory Transparency Register (COM(2016)0627) have finally been concluded, and urges the three institutions to swiftly implement it; underlines that in order to maintain a high level of trust in the European institutions among citizens, more transparency is needed regarding the meetings organised within the institutions; 17. Also encourages members of national governments and parliaments to aim for greater transparency regarding their meetings with interest representatives as, when taking decisions on EU matters, they are part of the EU legislature in the wider sense; Access to documents 18. Recalls that the right of public access to documents of the institutions is a fundamental right enshrined in the Treaties and the Charter and is inextricably linked with the democratic nature of the institutions; stresses that the widest exercise of this right at the earliest stage is essential, as it ensures the democratic scrutiny of the work and activities of the EU institutions; recalls that citizens\u2019 trust in political institutions is a key founding element of representative democracies; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/57 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",

Recalls its calls made in its previous resolutions on public access to documents; regrets the fact that there has been no proper follow-up from the Commission and the Council to several proposals made by Parliament; 20. Points out that transparency and full access to the documents held by the institutions have to be the rule, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, and that, as has already been stipulated by the precedents consistently set by the CJEU, exceptions to that rule have to be strictly interpreted, taking into account the overriding public interest in disclosure; 21. Reiterates the importance of not over-classifying documents, which could be to the detriment of public scrutiny; regrets the fact that official documents are frequently over-classified; reiterates its position that clear and uniform rules should be established for the classification and declassification of documents; 22. Takes note of the fact that the Commission faces the highest number of initial applications (6 912 in 2018) involving specified documents, followed by the Council (2 474 in 2018) and Parliament (498 in 2018); acknowledges the overall positive response rate (in 2018 the figures were 80 % for the Commission, 72,2 % for the Council and 96 % for Parliament); 23. Notes with interest that the main grounds for refusal are based on the need to protect the decision-making process of the institutions, the privacy and the integrity of individuals, and the commercial interests of a specific natural or legal person; further notes that for Parliament, the protection of legal advice has also been a relevant ground in cases where mainly Bureau documents were requested, while for the Commission, carrying out inspections, investigations and audits, and public security were also relevant grounds in refusing access to documents; 24. Welcomes the decision of the European Court of Justice, in case C-213/15 P ( Commission v Patrick Breyer ), where the Court upheld the judgment of the General Court, finding that the Commission cannot refuse access to any written submission of a Member State held by it, on the sole ground that it is a document relating to court proceedings; notes that the Court considers that any decision on such an application for access must be taken on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and that documents linked to the Court of Justice's judicial activity are not, as a matter of principle, outside the scope of the Regulation, where they are in the possession of the EU institutions listed in the Regulation, such as the Commission in this specific case; 25. Supports the call made by civil society ( 9 ) for public hearings of the European Court of Justice to be live streamed, as is already the case for some national and international courts, such as the Conseil Constitutionnel in France and the European Court of Human Rights; 26. Recalls its calls on the Commission and Council in its resolution of 28 April 2016 on public access to documents for the years 2014-2015; 27. Recalls that the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 has been blocked since 2012, and notes with regret the Commission\u2019s intention to withdraw this proposal; urges all involved parties to re-enter the process and continue working on the revision in order to adapt the provisions of the Regulation to the Treaty of Lisbon and to ensure that the scope extends to all EU institutions, bodies and agencies, with the ultimate aim of giving EU citizens wider and improved access to EU documents; 28. Points out that, as a result of the entry into force of the TEU and the TFEU, the right of access to documents pertains to all EU institutions, bodies, and agencies, as stated in Article 15(3) TFEU; believes that Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 should be amended and modernised in order to bring it into line with the Treaties, to react to the developments that have taken place in this field and in the light of the relevant case law of the CJEU and ECtHR; urges, therefore, all three institutions to work constructively in order to achieve the adoption of a revised Regulation; 29. Stresses that ensuring that citizens are able to understand, follow in detail and participate in the progress of legislation is a legal requirement under the Treaties and a basic requirement for democratic scrutiny and democracy as a whole; considers that where documents are created in the framework of trilogues, such as agendas, summaries of outcomes, minutes and general approaches in the Council, where they are available and in the format in which they are available, such documents are related to legislative procedures and cannot, in principle, be treated differently from other legislative documents; C 465/58 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 9 ) https://thegoodlobby.eu/campaigns/openletter-to-the-president-of-the-court-ofjustice-of-the-european-union-asking-foreu-courts- to-live-stream-their-publichearings ",

Emphasises the importance of transparency and public access to documents; stresses that a high level of transparency in the legislative process is essential in terms of enabling citizens, the media, civil society and other stakeholders to hold their elected officials and governments to account; acknowledges the valuable role played by the Ombudsman in liaising and acting as a mediator between the EU institutions and citizens, and highlights the Ombudsman\u2019s work in making the EU legislative process more accountable to the public; 31. Recalls that, according to the Ombudsman, restrictions on access to documents, particularly legislative documents, should be exceptional and limited to what is absolutely necessary; welcomes the Ombudsman\u2019s fast-track procedure for access to documents, but regrets the fact that her recommendations are not legally binding; 32. Points out that any decision denying public access to documents must be based on clearly and strictly defined legal exemptions, accompanied by a reasoned and specific justification, allowing citizens to understand the denial of access and to make effective use of the legal remedies available; notes with concern that currently the only legal avenue open to citizens for challenging a refusal of an access to documents request is to bring a legal action in the CJEU, which entails lengthy processes, the risk of high costs and an uncertain outcome, and puts an unreasonable burden on citizens challenging decisions, deterring them from doing so; 33. Invites, in this context, the EU institutions, bodies and agencies to adopt faster, less cumbersome and more accessible procedures for handling complaints against refusals to grant access; considers that a more proactive approach would help ensure effective transparency, as well as prevent unnecessary legal disputes that could result in needless costs and burdens for both the citizens and the institutions; considers that citizens should not be prevented from challenging decisions due to lack of means; recalls the possibility of applying for legal aid as enshrined in the Charter; invites the EU institutions to refrain from calling on the opposing party to bear the costs of court cases; 34. Recalls, in this context, the Ombudsman\u2019s decisions dated 19 December 2017, in case 682/2014/JF where the Commission\u2019s requirement that all persons who ask for public access to documents must provide their postal address for its paper post sending arrangements is maladministration, highlighting that insisting on renewed requests and procedural formalities, when they are unnecessary and serve no obvious useful purpose, shows a lack of respect for citizens\u2019 fundamental rights; 35. Strongly regrets the fact that the Council does not proactively publish most documents related to legislative files, preventing citizens from knowing what documents actually exist and thereby impeding their right to request access to documents; regrets the fact that the available information on legislative documents is presented by the Council in a register which is incomplete and not user-friendly; calls on the Council to list the documents related to legislative files in a user-friendly public register, thereby fully reflecting the public interest in transparency and allowing for legitimate scrutiny not only by citizens, but also by national parliaments; 36. Urges the Council to align its working methods with the standards of a parliamentary and participatory democracy as required under the Treaties, and reiterates that the Council must be as accountable and transparent as the other institutions; 37. Fully endorses the European Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations to the Council following the strategic inquiry, namely: (a) to systematically record the positions expressed by Member States in discussions with preparatory bodies, (b) to develop clear and publicly available criteria on how it designates documents as \u2018LIMITE\u2019, and (c) to systematically review the \u2018LIMITE\u2019 status of documents before the final adoption of a particular piece of legislation and that this review should be undertaken before informal negotiations in trilogues, at which point the Council will have already reached an initial position; urges the Council to take all measures necessary to implement the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations as quickly as possible in order to guarantee the transparency of legislative discussions in its preparatory bodies; 38. Considers the Council\u2019s current widespread and arbitrary practice of marking most preparatory documents in ongoing legislative procedures as \u2018LIMITE\u2019 as a restriction on citizens\u2019 right to the widest possible public access to legislative documents; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/59 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "39. Takes note of the fact that Parliament has seen a significant increase in applications requesting public access to the multi-column documents discussed in trilogue meetings following the judgment of the General Court in the De Capitani case ( 10 ), and notes with satisfaction that since the judgment, Parliament has disclosed all the multi-column documents to which access was requested under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001; welcomes this fact since the openness of the legislative process contributes to conferring greater legitimacy on the institutions in the eyes of EU citizens; underscores that the general requirement to give access to documents is the most appropriate tool for all the EU institutions to be able to respond to the huge increase in requests for documents; 40. Underlines that the Court ruling in the De Capitani case in March 2018 states that the institutions\u2019 views reflected in the \u2018four-column\u2019 documents did not fall under a general presumption of non-disclosure; notes that the sensitive nature of the subject matter reflected in the trilogue documents was not in itself considered to constitute sufficient grounds for refusing access to the public; 41. Recalls that the conclusions of the General Court apply to all EU institutions and that the Court makes it clear that where a document originating in an EU institution is covered by an exception to the right to public access, the institution must clearly assess and explain why access to this document could specifically and effectively undermine the interest protected by the exception, notably why full access to the documents at issue would undermine, specifically and actually, the decision-making process, thus requiring that this risk must be reasonably foreseeable and not purely hypothetical; stresses that any refusal of access to documents must be fully justified in every specific case; 42. Welcomes the fact that the ClientEarth v Commission case significantly clarifies the scope of the concept of \u2018legislative documents\u2019 and that the CJEU found that documents drawn up in the context of an impact assessment qualify as legislative documents and therefore cannot be protected under a general presumption against public disclosure; 43. Regrets the fact that the advice of the respective Legal Services of the Council, the Commission and Parliament are limited in access, and that often the advice of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service is not even available to the members of other committees; calls for the institutions to ensure transparency; 44. Takes note of the investigations opened by the European Ombudsman in 2020 into the practices of the agency Frontex when it comes to its obligations under EU rules with respect to public access to documents; urges the agency to follow up on the findings of the European Ombudsman and implement her recommendations on updating the register of documents and publishing the number of sensitive documents it holds that are not included in its register of documents ( 11 ); 45. Stresses the important role of whistle-blowers in unveiling cases of maladministration, and supports measures to improve the protection of whistle-blowers against retaliation; calls on the institutions to evaluate and, where necessary, review their internal arrangements for reporting wrongdoing; 46. Urges the Commission to ensure public access to all advance purchase agreements, in their full form, between the EU and private companies in the field of health, in particular when ordering vaccines; Conclusions 47. Stresses that the need for transparency should be in careful balance with the need to protect personal data and to allow decisions to be made with a degree of confidentiality where necessary; 48. Strongly emphasises that any exceptions to public access to EU documents or information need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration that access to such documents is the rule, while exceptions from the rule are matters of strict interpretation; 49. Calls for all the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies to develop a common approach to access to documentation, including the procedure for trilogue materials, and to constantly explore and develop new methods and measures to achieve maximum transparency; C 465/60 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ( 10 ) Judgment of the General Court of 22 March 2018, Emilio De Capitani v European Parliament , T-540/15, ECLI:EU:T:2018:167.

Calls for all the institutions to improve communication throughout the whole legislative cycle and to proactively disseminate more of their documents related to the legislative procedure in the most simple, user-friendly and accessible way, via their public websites and all other means of communication; underlines that more transparency is needed in relation to decision-making within infringement procedures; calls for the institutions to step up their efforts in establishing a dedicated and user-friendly joint database on the state of play of legislative files on which work is ongoing, as agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, allowing for transparency in the various steps of the legislative process and providing citizens with a clearer understanding of EU legislative procedures; 52. Recalls that, in accordance with Article 3 TEU and the Charter, the Union\u2019s rich linguistic diversity must be respected; calls for the institutions of the European Union to make every effort to provide access to documents in all the official languages of the European Union; 53. Emphasises that open democratic societies depend on the ability of citizens to access a variety of verifiable information sources so that they can form a view on different issues; points out that access to information enhances accountability in decision-making and is essential for the functioning of democratic societies; o o o 54.

The unadjusted gender pay gap is calculated as the relative difference between the average hourly earnings of women and men. It provides a simple indicator of wage inequalities, which explains its extensive use by policymakers. However, the unadjusted gender pay gap also includes both the possible discrimination between men and women in terms of \u2018unequal pay for equal work\u2019 and the impact of differences in the average characteristics of men and women in the labour market. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/aid_development_cooperation_fundamental_rights/report-gender-pay-gap-eu- countries_october2018_en_0.pdf.

Stresses that, in accordance with Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the EU has an obligation to ensure that all workers enjoy working conditions that respect their health, safety and dignity and calls for attention to be given to the fact that poverty and exclusion from the labour market and society exacerbate inequalities and segregation; recalls the fact that in implementing their policies, the Commission and the Member States should further strengthen the EU\u2019s social model and take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of a decent standard of living and adequate social protection for all, the fight against poverty and social exclusion; 2. Stresses that the TEU sets out that the Union has the basic obligation to work towards Europe\u2019s sustainable development, on the basis of, inter alia, a highly competitive social market economy that sets out to achieve full employment and social progress and a high level of protection; stresses that the EU should combat social exclusion and discrimination, and should promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and the protection of the rights of the child; 3. Agrees with the Commission that income inequality in the EU as a world region is lower than in some other major advanced economies, but it remains a concern; stresses that high inequality raises concerns about fairness, as entrenched inequality may result in inequality of opportunity and reduce potential growth; underlines that relatively high inequality may be linked to a higher risk-of-poverty rate and more pronounced social exclusion and a higher incidence of financial distress and, as such, may reduce social cohesion ( 70 ); 4. Notes that, although poverty rates among women vary considerably from one Member State to another, the risk of poverty and social exclusion in the risk groups to which older women, single women, women with children and single mothers, refugee and migrant women, women of colour, women from ethnic minorities, homosexual, bisexual and transgender women and women with disabilities belong is high, the average trend being that women are more at risk of poverty and social exclusion than men (22,8 % in 2018 in the EU); notes that other intersectional risk factors such as inactivity, lack of care services for children and dependant family members make some specific categories of women more vulnerable to poverty risks than others; 5.

Points out that, according to Eurostat, there are currently 64,6 million women and 57,6 million men living in poverty in the Member States, which shows that the impact of poverty on women and men is different; notes that those numbers show just how many women are affected, and must be examined alongside other indicators, such as age, life expectancy, income inequalities, the gender pay gap, household type and social transfers to understand their full significance; stresses that women\u2019s exposure to poverty is likely to be understated and calls on the Member States to collect poverty data in a way that reflects a person\u2019s household and individual reality, together with relevant equality data, and to conduct gender analyses of poverty statistics and policies, as one cannot assume that resources are equally shared among men and women within households; Measures against inequality 7.

Is convinced that the axiom \u2018work is the best remedy for poverty\u2019 does not always apply today in the face of low-wage sectors and precarious working conditions (including some forms of atypical employment), which is affecting the sustainability and adequacy of social security systems; believes, furthermore, that effective collective agreements and effective statutory minimum wage systems, where applicable, are important instruments for combating poverty; 11. Points out that growth is essential to tackling precariousness and poverty; is convinced that entrepreneurship needs to be fostered, including among women and young people; points out that SMEs, which create jobs and wealth and are the backbone of the European economy, must be supported; points out that they bring vitality to territories and contribute to innovation and the construction of a competitive, diversified and sustainable labour market; stresses that EU legislation must benefit businesses, particularly SMEs; 12. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, on the basis of their obligations under the ILO Conventions and the revised European Social Charter and their commitments to the European Pillar of Social Rights and the SDGs, to promote collective bargaining; calls on the Member States to adapt their national legislation where it hampers collective bargaining and the right to associate, negotiate and conclude collective agreements, and to respect and enforce the right to fair minimum wages, where applicable; 13.

        "D. whereas the negative effects of the pandemic are so far-reaching that they have further contributed to shrinking civic space in Member States across Europe, with many youth work and sporting organisations facing the prospect of having to close down, which would have a negative impact on the established structures of European and international cooperation and substantially limit civic engagement; E. whereas the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 affect young people\u2019s mental health and ability to socialise owing to both immediate and longer-term factors; whereas the lack of leisure activities and social constraints have a disproportionate effect on children and young people with disabilities; F. whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on sport and related sectors and industries; whereas the economic impact on professional sport has been enormous, as revenues have plummeted owing to numerous events at all levels having to be cancelled or held without spectators; G. whereas the ongoing impact of the pandemic on semi-professional and grassroots sport and recreation is devastating, with many sports clubs facing an existential threat as they are inherently non-profit and work mostly on a voluntary basis, and therefore operate without any financial reserves; H. whereas the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of sufficient possibilities for regular training and practice in physical contact sport are detrimental to athletes\u2019 progression and development; I. whereas sport is an important economic sector that accounts for 2,12 % of total GDP and 2,72 % of total employment in the EU and represents an estimated 5,67 million jobs; J. whereas sport fulfils important societal functions, by for example promoting social inclusion, integration, cohesion and values such as mutual respect and understanding, solidarity, diversity and equality, including gender equality; whereas sport and associated voluntary activities can improve physical and mental health and the employability of young people in particular, as well as help steer young people away from involvement in violence, including gender-based violence, crime and drug use; Youth 1. Is concerned that owing to the particular sensitivity of the youth labour market to economic cycles and economic crises, youth employment is hit harder by the fallout from the current pandemic, amplifying the negative trends of a sector largely dominated by unstable, low-paid, part-time jobs with weaker legal protections and social security standards; 2. Underlines the particularly acute impact the current pandemic has had on young people not in education, employment, or training (NEETs) and highlights the need to tackle the problems faced by young people from vulnerable groups; stresses the need to take into account the considerable gender disparities in relation to the proportion of NEETs; 3. Underlines that labour-intensive sectors often characterised by low pay, such as wholesale and retail, accommodation, tourism and food services, which typically employ low-skilled young workers and working students, have been most dramatically affected; notes that youth unemployment and poverty have risen steadily since the outbreak of the pandemic; believes that it is likely that youth unemployment will rise further in the short term and may stay above pre-pandemic levels in the long term; 4. Urges the Commission and the Member States to take all the necessary measures to counter the disastrous effects on youth employment, including through macroeconomic (fiscal and monetary) policies that direct public expenditure towards the provision of subsidies for recruitment or youth guarantees in support of tailored schemes for job retention and creation and for the upskilling and reskilling of young people, as well as investment in economic sectors that have the potential to absorb young jobseekers, by offering quality jobs and decent working and remuneration conditions; 5. Recalls the role of volunteering in developing life and work skills for young people; considers that financially-backed volunteering has the potential to help unemployed young people to withstand the economic shock of the COVID-19 crisis while contributing to society and gaining valuable experience that facilitates their transition to long-term regular employment; considers that the European Solidarity Corps can help young Europeans to broaden their opportunities 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/83 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "beyond their local realities; urges the Commission, in this respect, to provide clarity and uniform guidelines for implementing programmes in crisis situations and removing barriers to participation caused by, inter alia, the lack of flexibility in funding, reductions in funding, increased restrictions on the granting of visas to volunteers from partner countries, and the failure to ensure the legal status of young people as volunteers; 6. Stresses the vital importance of informal and non-formal learning, the arts, sport, volunteering and social activities for encouraging youth participation and social cohesion as tools that can have a huge impact on local communities and can help address many of today\u2019s societal challenges; 7. Highlights that with the agreement it struck on 21 July 2020, the European Council should have been more ambitious in its support for the young generations \u2014 the future of Europe \u2014 not least by including greater support for young people in the recovery plans by allocating 10 % to education and earmarking a 20 % contribution to the European Digital Strategy and the achievement of a digital single market; underlines, in this context, that sectoral programmes that have a direct focus on youth, such as Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, the Youth Guarantee and the Child Guarantee, or that have the potential to support the transition towards a fairer and more socially and environmentally sustainable Europe, have to be mobilised in such a way as to achieve their full potential, as they risk missing their ambitious targets, which would be bitterly disappointing for young people and future generations; 8. Underlines that the current pandemic has exacerbated the digital gap in the EU and, as such, highlights the urgent need to promote digital literacy for all and to encourage the widespread use, recognition and validation of alternatives, including informal and non-formal learning opportunities, such as online and digital learning and training; calls, in particular, for a strong focus and support for young learners who experienced a loss of income in technical, dual education and vocational education and training, and for the development and extensive use of quality digital tools, teaching and learning materials and content, in order to prevent people from dropping out of education and ensure a smooth and effective school-to-work transition; stresses that notwithstanding the specific context of COVID-19, it is important to maintain in-person learning to ensure that no one is left behind, in particular young children, vulnerable groups and young people from difficult socio-economic backgrounds without technological means or skills; 9. Urges the Commission and the Member States to increase investment in digital solutions and literacy for the development of practical skills, competences and qualifications, to make access to digital literacy available to all, and to promote the development of independent, multilingual, inclusive and free online learning tools in order to improve the overall level of digital skills and competences as part of the implementation of the Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027); stresses the need to develop competences among teachers, trainers, head teachers, parents and managers with a view to improving the provision of online, distance and blended learning with a particular focus on skills development programmes; 10. Is concerned that the COVID-19 crisis has increased anxiety and fear among young people, which risks having a considerable impact on their lives and their school-to-work transition; calls for the wide use of tailored mental health services, psychosocial support and sporting activities, whether as standalone or modular measures, and for scaled-up mental well-being support in training and education institutions in order to ensure that the pandemic does not produce long-lasting psychological effects; highlights the impact of the pandemic on young people with disabilities and young people living in rural and remote areas and calls on the Commission and the Member States to pay particular attention to the needs of this group by adapting the available support measures and services; 11. Calls for a rights-based approach, rooted in the principles of non-discrimination and equality, to be taken to the various policies in order to tackle the multiple forms of discrimination suffered by young people during the COVID-19 crisis, and reminds the Commission and the Member States of the need for a special approach to supporting and protecting vulnerable groups, such as young people with disabilities, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and at risk of domestic violence, young migrants and refugees, and young members of the LGTBIQ+ community; stresses the importance of free access to quality information on COVID-19 the pandemic as a whole, adapted to young people\u2019s needs; 12. Points out that sport and youth work activities in all their diversity are at particular risk throughout Europe, which is resulting in the shrinking of civic space, and urges the Commission and the Member States to take measures to preserve structures and ensure diversity of supply in the fields of youth and sport; recalls the need for the close involvement of local authorities, civil society organisations and social partners in the implementation of solutions designed to support young people and youth and sport organisations; highlights the importance for social cohesion of organised sport and youth organisations; C 465/84 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "Sport 13. Is deeply concerned about possible lasting damage to the sports sector, not only in economic and employment terms, but also for society as a whole; 14. Underlines that sport and physical exercise are particularly important under the circumstances caused by the pandemic, since they strengthen physical and mental resilience; welcomes the fact that, according to the data, the lockdowns have led some people to practise certain individual sports more frequently and actively; is concerned, on the other hand, about the lack of physical activity observed among many young people during the lockdowns and the consequences this could have for public health; 15. Stresses that the European sport model needs to be preserved and promoted, as solidarity, fairness and a value-based approach will be more important than ever for the recovery of the sports sector and for the survival of grassroots sport; 16. Recalls that sport promotes and teaches values such as mutual respect and understanding, solidarity, diversity, fairness, cooperation and civic engagement and fosters cohesion and the integration of migrants and refugees; emphasises that sport knows no borders and unites people from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds; considers that grassroots sport in particular plays an essential role in promoting the social inclusion of people with fewer opportunities, people belonging to vulnerable groups and people with disabilities; calls on the Commission, in this regard, to strengthen inclusion through sport and to explore new avenues in order to maximise its impact and reach; calls for increased support to be provided to low-income families in order to enable their children to take part in sport and other leisure activities; 17. Underlines that disabled people face considerable financial and organisational challenges in accessing sport, both in the context of grassroots activities and at professional level, which have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore urges the Commission to address this problem specifically in its upcoming disability strategy; 18. Stresses that the COVID-19 pandemic is having devastating consequences on the entire sports sector at all levels, especially on sporting organisations and clubs, leagues, gyms and fitness centres, athletes, coaches, staff, and sport-related business, including sports event organisers and sports media; considers that the road to recovery will be challenging and underlines the need for targeted relief measures; 19. Considers that general recovery instruments adopted by the EU in response to the crisis must help support the sports sector in the short term and urges Member States to ensure that national support funds, the structural funds, and national recovery and resilience plans benefit the sports sector despite its specific characteristics and organisational structures; 20. Stresses the importance of rescue packages targeting all sports; highlights that while major spectator sports have often been the hardest hit financially, they should not be the only ones to qualify for financial aid or be given priority for it; 21. Believes that existing financial support may not be sufficient and calls on the Commission to explore all possible avenues for delivering additional targeted support for both amateur and professional sports with the aim of increasing the viability of the whole sector; 22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to strengthen the recovery and crisis resilience of the sports sector in general, and grassroots sport in particular, through the EU programmes available and for which the sector is eligible, including the Erasmus+ programme and the European Solidarity Corps, and to ensure full access for sport to the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund Plus and EU4Health; underlines that the incorporation of sport into the respective regulations and the removal of all obstacles in the application process at national level are key in this regard; 23. Invites the Commission to thoroughly assess the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sport across the Member States and, on the basis of the results of this assessment, develop a European approach to coping with the challenges and mitigating the possible consequences; 24. Calls for a structured and systematic exchange of best practices between Member States in dealing with the effects of the crisis on sport and for a systematic analysis of data and information on sporting participation and the impact of COVID-19; considers it useful to explore the development of new ways of practising sport in situations requiring physical distancing; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/85 Wednesday 10 February 2021 ",
        "25. Is of the opinion that broad cross-sectoral cooperation is urgently needed in order to overcome the challenges that have emerged in the sports sector as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; underlines, in this regard, that collaboration at all levels, including all those involved in sport, the sport-related business sector and other relevant stakeholders, should be further encouraged; 26. Notes that the use of digital solutions such as sports apps has increased during the crisis; considers that the further digitalisation of the sports sector will increase its resilience in any future crises; calls for the development of digital tools enabling the financing of sporting activities during the pandemic; 27. Calls on the Commission to coordinate all measures taken to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on sport in a dedicated EU action plan; 28. Urges the Council to prioritise measures and actions aimed at helping the sector cope with the consequences of the pandemic in the short and long term in the forthcoming EU Work Plan for Sport; 29.

Calls for measures to strengthen doping prevention during and after COVID-19 lockdowns to promote athletes\u2019 health and fair play in European sport; 31. Considers that different sports have been affected to different degrees and that within certain sports, smaller clubs, lower-division competitions and grassroots activities have suffered, owing in particular to their economic dependence on small sponsors or on the athletes\u2019 own quotas; emphasises that amateur sport is the basis for sport at a professional level, as small, grassroots sports clubs make a significant contribution to the development of young athletes and mostly work on a voluntary basis; underlines the importance of solidarity within the European sporting community across and within different sports, and calls for increased support to minority and grassroots sport in the light of the economic difficulties in maintaining their activities; 32. Points out that the constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of sufficient possibilities for regular training and practice in sports that require physical contact have been detrimental to the progression and development of athletes; considers that event organisers, trainers and the athletes themselves should be made aware of the possible implications of the prolonged lack of intensive training; asks for cooperation among sporting institutions and organisations in supporting projects and concepts whose focus is on regaining lost capabilities; 33. Considers that arenas and stadiums are at the core of the social fabric of sport and cultural ecosystems in our societies; recognises that enabling venues to reopen is essential for the health and well-being of our citizens and for economic recovery, both now and in the future; o o o 34.

Welcomes the Commission communication entitled \u2018European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience\u2019, which places skills at the heart of the EU policy agenda and ensures that the right to quality and inclusive training and lifelong learning for all and in all areas and sectors, enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights\u2019 very first principle, becomes a reality across the Union; 2. Welcomes the 12 flagship actions set out in the communication as well as the quantitative objectives to be achieved by 2025; calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide broad accessibility to skilling and upskilling for vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, low-skilled adults, minorities, including the Roma, as well as people with a migrant background; calls on the Commission to conduct research how to implement this right, and to introduce a monitoring mechanism which encourages Member States to set up national action programmes and present regular national reports on how this right is being upheld; 3. Highlights the importance of access to training and re-skilling for workers in industries and sectors that need to undergo fundamental changes with a view to a green and digital transition; highlights that qualifications and certified competences provide added value to workers, improving their positions in the labour market, and can be transferred in labour market transitions; calls for public policy on skills to be oriented to recognition, certification and validation of qualifications and competences; 4. Underlines that skills and lifelong learning are vital for sustainable growth, productivity, investment, and innovation, and are therefore key factors for the competitiveness of businesses, especially SMEs; emphasises that close cooperation and exchange of best practices between all relevant actors involved in skills development, including social partners and all levels of government, is crucial to ensuring that everyone can acquire the skills needed on the labour market and in society at large; highlights in this regard the need to collect up-to-date data, information and forecasts regarding skills needs and demand on the labour market, including at local level; supports the launch of the Pact for Skills, aiming to enhance actions undertaken by companies for upskilling and re-skilling Europe\u2019s workforce; calls for local Pacts for Skills to better reach people from sectors hit the most by the COVID-19 crisis and to help them requalify so as to remain active in the labour market; 5. Recalls that modernising vocational, education and training systems is key to preparing young people and adults for the green and digital transitions, and to ensuring that core age and older workers maintain and develop the skills required to safeguard employability and extend working life; recalls, further, that this modernisation is key to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; welcomes the Commission proposal for a \u2018Council Recommendation on vocational education and training (VET) for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience\u2019; stresses that VET programmes need to be targeted, future-oriented, accessible, permeable, interconnected at EU level, and learner-centred, allowing for flexible individual pathways, providing VET learners and teachers with the skill set to become active and democratic citizens, and to thrive in the labour market and society; recalls that modernising VET programmes must go hand in hand with increasing their attractiveness so that more young people opt for them; highlights the importance of best practices related to dual education systems and VET which could contribute to structural changes in the labour market and lead to higher levels of youth employment; 6. Believes that apprenticeships can play an important role in this regard, as they prepare young people for jobs that are in high demand, and can thus contribute to their sustainable integration into the labour market; calls on the Commission and the Member States to use the EU resources for the promotion of VET and encourage employers to create paid internship and apprenticeship programmes for students of vocational schools and to organise competitions and industry tournaments for them; encourages companies to ensure up-reskilling and re-skilling of their workforce and to enhance provision of apprenticeships in line with the Quality Framework for Traineeships and European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships; calls in this regard on the Commission to review existing European instruments such as the Quality 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/115 Thursday 11 February 2021 ( 30 ) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/EDN-20191004-1#:~:text=Among%20teachers%20working%20in% 20the,were%20aged%2050%20or%20older.&text=In%20all%20EU%20Member%20States,in%202017%20were%20predominantly %20female ",
        "Framework for Traineeships and the European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships, and to insert quality criteria for proposals, including the principle of fair remuneration for trainees and interns, access to social protection, sustainable employment and social rights; stresses that these criteria would ensure the transition of trainees and apprentices into stable, quality employment, and help to ensure gender-balanced opportunities for people across sectors, as well as opportunities that offer long-term security, social protection and equal and decent working conditions, and that do not contribute to the creation of precarious employment; 7. Recalls that vocational skills are one of the driving forces of the European economy, and calls for a correlation between conventional education and VET, where the development of skills in VET, either as a central focus or a complementary part of the options available for both students and adults, can boost available opportunities for job-seekers, would foster job mobility and improve labour market resilience in crisis situations; 8. Advises the Commission to provide recommendations to Member States that correlate VET with the Skills Agenda, bearing in mind national competences and the principle of subsidiarity, with a focus on improving early VET career guidance and maximising the number of opportunities European youth have for their skills development; welcomes in this aspect the input provided on the topic by Cedefop and Eurofound; 9. Underlines the paramount importance of providing active support to teachers and trainers by adopting an effective policy package to ensure that they are well prepared and upskilled for the digital and green transformation of schools and education institutions; believes that educational trade unions must be involved in defining the necessary skills and competences to be acquired by teachers and trainers within initial and continuous professional development related to the green and digital transition; believes that investments in public education must be considerably increased, and that social dialogue with the trade unions must be a key pillar to guarantee adequate salaries, pensions and fair working conditions for professionals in the educational and training sectors; 10. Stresses the need to improve, with the involvement of the social partners, the system of skills anticipation to better identify emerging changes in skills needs, deliver generic, sectoral and occupation-specific skills where needed, and minimise skills bottlenecks and skills imbalances; welcomes in this respect the Commission\u2019s proposed actions to improve skills intelligence; highlights that applying artificial intelligence and big data analysis to skills intelligence in the definition of new job profiles needs to be monitored regularly and systematically to prevent bias and direct and indirect discrimination, and that corrective measures should be ensured; underlines that strengthening career guidance from an early age and equal access to information and support for students and adult learners can help them to choose suitable educational and vocational pathways leading to employment opportunities that match their interests, talent and competences, reducing skills mismatches; emphasises the importance of cooperation between employment services and social services to identify and support people who have recently lost or are at the risk of losing their job; underlines the importance of lifelong guidance in the European Skills Agenda and the need to improve the access to quality guidance; 11. Welcomes the recommendation to Member States to strengthen early warning systems with the aim of identifying young people at risk of becoming NEETs (not in education, employment, or training); is convinced that preventive actions, such as skills assessments and career and vocational guidance, which focus on helping early school leavers into employment or education before they become unemployed, if appropriately conducted, and the provision of inclusive and non-discriminatory mainstream education could lead to a reduction in the number of NEETs in the longer term; 12. Stresses the need to boost the role of social partners by ensuring that the skills policy encourages collective agreements regarding the definition and regulation of skills and continuing training by consulting the social partners about competency needs and the update of the curricula of education and training systems, and by co-designing on-the-job training with workers\u2019 representatives to adapt it to the needs of the workforce; C 465/116 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Thursday 11 February 2021 ",

Calls on the Commission to include an indicator on skills gaps in the social scoreboard, in line with the aims and the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which can be useful for policy makers at national level to identify where more efforts are required and to better coordinate at EU level, tracking skills gaps evolutions and progresses, and incentivising an upward convergence among Member States; 14. Is of the opinion that the mutual recognition of learning outcomes, diplomas, training, professional qualifications and skills acquired in another Member State must be improved, and will help to overcome skills shortages and skills mismatches; believes that this will also enable adults to obtain full qualifications, foster mobility, make the EU\u2019s labour market more integrated and resilient, and strengthen Europe\u2019s competitiveness; emphasises the importance of addressing skills shortages and mismatches by facilitating the mobility of learners and cross-border recognition of qualifications through a better use of tools such as the European Qualifications Framework, Europass CV, the European Credit Transfer System (ECVET), Skills Panorama, ESCO or EURES; welcomes the Commission communication on achieving the European Education Area by 2025; 15. Emphasises that many citizens gain valuable skills and experience outside the system of formal education or training as is for example the case of informal carers providing care to persons with disabilities or the elderly; believes that these informal skills should be recognised, as they can help the informal carers to increase their possibilities on the labour market; 16. Calls for the full implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive, as the common training framework it includes can increase the number of professionals benefitting from the automatic recognition system, and supports correlating it with the European Commission\u2019s development of a digital and pan-European EU Skills -Passport; 17. Calls on the Commission and Member States to increase their efforts in order to retain foreign students after they have graduated from EU universities; stresses that granting graduates access to intra-EU mobility and a jobseekers visa could increase the attractiveness of the EU as a whole; 18. Calls for the unblocking of the current Blue Card proposal in order to provide European companies with the competences necessary for them to remain or become competitive; 19. Notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the importance of both basic and advanced digital skills and resilient education systems, and their ability to adjust between in-person, distance and online and hybrid methods of teaching; notes further that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the skills demand on the labour market, thus increasing the digital skills gap, and exacerbated pre-existing education inequalities and deficits; highlights the need for every citizen to have at least basic digital skills and for highly-skilled specialists to be trained and equipped with advanced digital skills and innovative and entrepreneurial thinking; 20. Regrets that gender gaps persist in women\u2019s access to skills development and participation in the labour market ( 31 ); underlines that the main challenges women face include barriers to education and training in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects, sociocultural and economic constraints, especially in rural and informal economies, and a significant failure to promote women\u2019s equal opportunities to choose often male-dominated occupations; calls on the Commission to encourage mentoring networks, thereby allowing more female role models to encourage women to make alternative choices to classically gender-stereotyped occupations ( 32 ); calls for the avoidance of stereotypes and gender stereotyping through training because it is linked to employability and creates a vicious cycle, thus perpetuating the pronounced segregation of labour; stresses that 90 % of jobs require basic digital skills, and women only represent 17 % of people in information and communications technology (ICT) courses and careers in the EU ( 33 ) and only 36 % of STEM graduates ( 34 ), despite the fact that girls outperform boys in digital literacy ( 35 ); 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/117 Thursday 11 February 2021 ( 31 ) ILO Policy brief, August 2020, https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/\u2014ed_emp/\u2014ifp_skills/documents/publication/ wcms_244380.pdf ( 32 ) \u2018ICT for Work: Digital Skills in the Workplace\u2019, European Commission, 2017.

Highlights the importance of education and skills development to address gender bias and support gender equality, and calls for increased efforts at both the national and European level to break this gender imbalance and to ensure that women can access quality lifelong learning and training, including after periods of absence for care reasons; emphasises the need for gender-sensitive recruitment and selection processes in the private and public sectors, and particularly in future-oriented sectors such as STEM and the digital sector where women are underrepresented; highlights in this regard that discrimination on grounds of gender harms not only the individual affected but also society as a whole; recalls that measures must be taken so that the impact of the crisis does not exacerbate gender inequality, mitigating the disproportionate and long-lasting impact on women\u2019s rights, incomes and social protection, and preventing further inequalities and discrimination in the world of work, paying particular attention to the highly gendered labour market, the digital and green transition, and the unequal distribution of unpaid domestic and care work; 22. Underlines that equal opportunities for all are key, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to make it a priority to close the digital skills gap by ensuring that vulnerable regions and deprived citizens, as well as those at the risk of social exclusion, including people with disabilities or coming from ethnic minorities, have access to digital education and training, the minimum required hardware, widespread access to the internet, and digital support and other technological learning tools; underlines that support must be given to these categories to raise the digital skills they need to thrive and to avoid deepening inequalities, ensuring that no one is left behind; 23. Notes with great interest the opportunities and challenges provided by the spread of digital solutions like telework, for which the development of digital skills is crucial; recalls the importance of a European legislative framework aiming to regulate telework conditions and the right to disconnect across the Union, and to ensure decent working and employment conditions in the digital economy driven by the acquisition of new skills; 24. Stresses the numerous opportunities that digital work offers to improve the working conditions of employees, including for employees close to the age of retirement, and to increase the inclusion of people with disabilities; regrets that people with disabilities continue to be disadvantaged in the labour market, and that too often their lack of access to education and training may be responsible for their exclusion from the labour market; calls for a particular focus to be placed by the Commission in its recommendations to Member States on ways to improve the access of people with disabilities to digital skilling or re-skilling, coordinating it with the new needs of the emerging global digital economy; 25. Notes that in the context of increasing teleworking, the Commission and Member States must make skills fostering this new way of work central to their strategies; underlines that tele-education and tele-schools pose challenges to both educators and recipients of education alike, and that the skills needed to deliver tele-education and the training of trainers and educators are a short-term priority for Europe at this time; 26. Calls on the Commission to support the offer of training for workers in receipt of short-time work or partial unemployment allowances including via the SURE scheme; calls on Member States to offer suitable training measures for affected workers; 27. Calls on employers to adapt workplace practices that capitalise on the skills of the workforce and that support skills development through focus on the education of the next generation of managers on issues regarding the deployment of organisational practices leveraging skills utilisation and development, as well as on backing national governments and social partners in developing networks and support structures to advise organisations on the most suitable combination of workplace practices for their circumstances; 28. Calls for the facilitation of the recognition, validation and portability of attainments in the field of non-formal and informal learning, including those developed in digitally-enabled employment forms such as platform work; 29. Calls for immediate and bold European, national, regional and local measures, evaluation mechanisms and resources to put digital skills at the heart of education and training policies, while safeguarding a high level of reading and mathematical skills among learners, making digital skills, IT tools and internet access available for all, improving the digital skills of teachers and trainers, and equipping schools, training institutions, VET providers, organisations active in the field of adult education and universities, with public and independent online learning platforms and other technologies and the C 465/118 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Thursday 11 February 2021 ",

Deplores the fact that in Europe there are still children without any access to education, as well as pupils and students without any or adequate access to digital education due to a lack of any or adequate digital equipment, software or internet connection; reiterates the need to improve connectivity at all levels, in particular in rural and remote areas where it is often lacking, and to increase access to digital equipment; points to the cutting-edge innovation in educational computers, tablets and software in Europe; 31. Underlines that the consequences of COVID-19 offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the digital and technological revolution in lifelong learning, which can break physical barriers, where possible, and significantly increase its reach and impact; encourages Member States and education providers to increase location-less learning opportunities, allowing students in remote and rural areas or abroad to access courses around the EU without location constraints; 32. Stresses that European and national measures, including educational programmes and targeted investments, should be developed and implemented with the ultimate aim of ensuring citizens\u2019 readiness and preparation for future jobs which require digital skills, in order to seize the full potential of the digital transition in the EU labour market and make it possible for companies to make full use of new working methods, such as telework; 33. Points out the need to further clarify the European Universities initiative and its ambition to set standards for higher education in the EU; reiterates that successful cooperation between universities has always relied on a bottom-up approach, academic independence and excellence, and that the Bologna process is an important tool for university cooperation in the EU and beyond; 34. Notes that the green transition is an important driver of labour demand across all sectors and can create millions of jobs; recalls that a successful transition to a green economy needs to go hand in hand with skilling, re-skilling and upskilling measures to develop the skills, knowledge and competence required by a green economy; welcomes in this respect the Commission\u2019s actions to support the acquisition of skills for the green transition; calls for swift action to avoid skills bottlenecks in this area and to allow the EU to remain a global leader in the green economy; encourages the Member States and regional and local authorities to integrate sustainable development and environmental competences and skills into training and education systems; 35. Highlights that student and teacher mobility is one of the main tools for exchanging ideas and best practices, and to increase the quality of skills training across the Union; insists that such mobility has to be accessible and inclusive; notes that, while physical mobility should always take a prime role, virtual learning will become increasingly important as a complement, and also as a replacement in extremis, as evidenced by the COVID-19 measures; 36. Notes that creative and artistic skills are essential for the economy, and calls for the introduction of a more horizontal approach in the Skills Agenda in order to include them into all curricula; 37. Stresses that the implementation of the Skills Agenda requires appropriate funding both on the European, national and local level; expects the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework and Next Generation EU to provide for significantly increased resources for skills development; recalls that the main responsibility for up- and reskilling lies with the Member States and companies, and calls therefore on Member States to invest more in skills development and education budgets since important human capital investment is key to ensuring sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience; 38. Underlines the importance of programmes and instruments such as Erasmus+, Horizon Europe, the European Solidarity Corps, Creative Europe, the Digital Europe Programme and the Youth and Child Guarantees in supporting young people and adults to gain the new competences and quality skills needed in the digital and green economy and the world of work, and in providing learning mobility opportunities; calls for the potential of these programmes to be continuously explored by the Commission and Member States in order to foster permanent skilling correlation with job market needs; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/119 Thursday 11 February 2021 ",

Expresses its concern about the location of the Ostrovets nuclear power plant at 50 km from Vilnius (Lithuania) and at close proximity to other EU countries such as Poland, Latvia and Estonia; 2. Deplores the fact that the project is being implemented despite protests from Belarusian citizens and that members of Belarusian NGOs seeking to raise awareness regarding the construction of the plant in Ostrovets have been persecuted and unlawfully arrested; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/123 Thursday 11 February 2021 ",
        "3. Notes with concern that the plant is being implemented as a geopolitical project of Belarus and Russia and that its construction and future operation is a source of possible threat to the European Union and its Member States with regard to safety, health and the protection of the environment; 4. Remains concerned about the hasty commissioning of a nuclear power plant which does not comply with the highest international environmental and nuclear safety standards, including the IAEA recommendations; 5. Deplores the persistent lack of transparency and official information regarding recurrent emergency shutdowns of the reactor and equipment failure during the commissioning stage of the plant in 2020, including the breakdown of four voltage transformers and the malfunctioning of cooling systems, while there were eight known incidents during the construction stage of the plant, including two incidents related to the reactor pressure vessel; 6. Notes that the EU peer review in 2018 revealed numerous deficiencies, that only a limited number of its recommendations have reportedly been implemented so far, and that implementation needs to be verified by the EU experts; 7. Notes that the quantity and frequency of safety incidents raise major concerns regarding the poor quality assurance and control in the plant\u2019s design, manufacturing and assembling phases and its low operational safety, which need to be properly addressed in the EU peer review; 8. Urges Belarus to ensure full respect for international nuclear and environmental safety standards, and transparent, inclusive and constructive cooperation with international authorities without further delay; invites Belarus to discontinue the selective application of the IAEA standards and peer review recommendations; 9. Notes that nuclear safety standards must be given the highest priority not only during the planning and construction but also during the operation of the nuclear power plant, and must be constantly overseen by an independent regulator; 10. Is concerned that the current regulatory authority in Belarus (Gosatomnadzor \u2013Department of Nuclear and Radiation Safety of the Ministry for Emergency Situations) is under constant political pressure and lacks sufficient independence both in form and in substance; stresses, therefore, that a transparent and attentive peer review is also crucial during the operational phase of the plant; 11. Notes the decision of the parties to the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention) of 11 December 2020 on compliance by Belarus with its obligations under the convention in respect of the Belarusian nuclear power plant in Ostrovets, and urges Belarus to ensure full implementation of the Espoo Convention; 12. Stresses the need to build up and maintain an early warning system for the measuring of radiation in EU countries located in the vicinity of the plant; 13. Urges the Belarusian authorities to fully cooperate with ENSREG in the stress test process, including a formal review and urgent implementation of Belarus\u2019 National Action Plan; 14. Regrets that an ENSREG peer review mission to the Ostrovets plant, which was originally planned to take place in December 2020, had to be cancelled due to organisational reasons on the host\u2019s side, as well as due to the COVID-19 pandemic; 15. Welcomes the first phase of the current EU peer review consisting of a site visit in early February 2021; stresses the importance of the timely completion of the peer review process and the publication of its findings, and that at least a preliminary report should be transmitted to Belarus already before March 2021 when the commercial start of the plant is planned by the Belarusian authorities; notes that all safety issues are equally important and must be addressed before the commercial start of the plant; 16. Deeply regrets the hasty commercial start of the plant in March 2021 and stresses that all ENSREG safety recommendations must be implemented before the nuclear power plant can start its commercial operation; encourages the Commission to work closely with the Belarusian authorities in order to suspend the starting process until all EU stress test recommendations are fully implemented and all necessary safety improvements are in place, and after Belarusian society and neighbouring countries have been duly informed of the measures taken; C 465/124 EN Official Journal of the European Union 17.11.2021 Thursday 11 February 2021 ",

Urges the Commission and ENSREG to continue a transparent and attentive peer review of the plant, to insist on the immediate implementation of all recommendations and to ensure effective monitoring of the implementation process, including regular visits by the peer review team to the Ostrovets site, including during the operation of the facility; stresses, in that regard, the importance of effective cooperation with the IAEA; 18. Notes that, despite the common agreement between the Baltic countries to cease commercial exchanges of electricity with Belarus, is it still possible for electricity from Belarus to enter the EU market via the Russian grid; 19. Recalls the European Council conclusions of 10-11 December 2020, and supports the efforts to investigate possible measures preventing commercial electricity imports from third countries\u2019 nuclear facilities that do not fulfil EU recognised safety levels, including the nuclear power plant in Ostrovets; 20. Invites the Commission to assess and propose measures to suspend electricity trade with Belarus in a manner that is compliant with the obligations under international trade, energy and nuclear law, in order to ensure that electricity produced in the Ostrovets plant does not enter the EU energy market while Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are still connected to the BRELL network; 21. Stresses the strategic importance of accelerating the synchronisation of the Baltic electricity grid with the Continental European Network and underlines that the future operation of the Ostrovets nuclear power plant should not in any way hinder the desynchronisation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the BRELL network and that the European Union should continue the integration of the three Baltic States into the EU electricity grid; 22. Expresses its full solidarity with Belarusian citizens and the citizens of EU countries directly concerned by the construction and operation of the Ostrovets plant and calls for a further high-level involvement of the EU and its institutions in this issue of ultimate European importance; 23. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States. 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/125 Thursday 11 February 2021 ",

        "Q. whereas the democratic opening in Myanmar, which has taken place since the 2010s, was largely motivated by the need to economically develop the country, since it had been suffering under strict international sanctions as a result of its military rule and devastating human rights record; whereas as a result of the cautious democratic reforms, certain international sanctions were slowly rolled back, which therefore allowed for economic development, and benefited large parts of the population of Myanmar; whereas the coup restores the state before the democratisation processes and undermines the conditions for granting \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019 (EBA) preferences and the roll-back of sanctions; R. whereas human rights violations, in particular against the Muslim minority in Myanmar \u2014 especially the Rohingya \u2013, which the Government of Myanmar has failed to recognise as an ethnic group of its country, continued after the democratic opening and tragically culminated in atrocities being committed in 2017, which the UN characterised as ethnic cleansing, and led to a massive exodus of refugees towards neighbouring Bangladesh; whereas the Rohingya minority, despite numerous calls by the international community, continue to be persecuted in Myanmar to this very day; S. whereas international calls to stop ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya and to improve their situation were largely ignored by the Government of Myanmar; whereas as a consequence, in September 2019 Parliament ultimately suspended Aung San Suu Kyi, then State Counsellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar, from its Sakharov human rights prize community for her failure to act against these well-documented human rights violations; whereas international sanctions over human rights violations have since been issued against the military and the ruling Commander-in-Chief General Min Aung Hlaing, among other people; T. whereas there are numerous ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Rohingya, Karen, Rakhine, Shan and Chin peoples; whereas internal conflicts have led to the tragic loss of thousands of lives over the past decades; whereas recent clashes in Kayin State have led to 4 000 people being displaced since December 2020 alone; whereas in recent years, the military has allegedly committed serious human rights violations and atrocities, including rape and war crimes, prompting the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an investigation with specific regard to the situation of the Rohingya minority; whereas the IIFFMM has called for the investigation and prosecution of General Min Aung Hlaing for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States; U. whereas the International Court of Justice\u2019s (ICJ) Order of 23 January 2020 indicated provisional measures in the case relating to the Genocide Convention and the Rohingya brought by The Gambia against Myanmar; whereas Myanmar\u2019s Government, with Aung San Suu Kyi leading its defence at the ICJ, has called the genocide allegations a misleading and incomplete factual picture of the situation; whereas Myanmar\u2019s Government has taken a limited number of steps to counter human rights violations through several presidential directives; whereas the Government has yet to amend or repeal key laws that facilitate discrimination against the Rohingya, including the 1982 Citizenship Law; V. whereas the EU has consistently called for those responsible for such crimes to be held to account and sponsored the resolutions adopted at the UN HRC of 27 September 2018 and at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly of 16 November 2018; whereas the most senior military figures who supervised the attacks against the Rohingya remain in their posts and have participated in the coup; whereas Parliament has on numerous occasions expressed its condemnation of human rights violations and the systematic and widespread attacks against the Rohingya population; W. whereas since 2013, the European Union has politically and financially supported Myanmar\u2019s process of democratic transition and has undertaken enormous efforts to promote peace, human rights and development in the country;

Urges the Commission to issue urgent advisories to EU-based businesses alerting them to the human rights, reputational and legal risks of doing business with Myanmar\u2019s military; strongly urges EU-based businesses to conduct thorough human rights due diligence, and to ensure they have no ties with Myanmar\u2019s security forces, their individual members, or entities owned or controlled by them, and that they are not contributing, directly or indirectly, to the military\u2019s crackdown on democracy and human rights; calls on EU-based undertakings, including parent holdings and subsidiaries, to urgently re-evaluate their business ties in Myanmar and suspend any relationships with companies linked to the military; points to the current preparations for corporate due diligence legislation imposing human rights due diligence obligations on EU companies and companies operating in the single market, ensuring that companies that contribute or have links to violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Myanmar are held accountable in accordance with national law; 18.

        "T. whereas women are more vulnerable to the consequences of climate change ( 17 ); whereas, while women seem to show more concern for the climate in their behaviour than men, women remain underrepresented in decision-making positions concerned with tackling the climate crisis and represent globally only 32 % of the renewable energy workforce ( 18 ); U. whereas a gender gap exists across all digital technology domains, especially in innovative technologies, such as the AI and cybersecurity domains; whereas gender stereotyping, cultural discouragement and a lack of awareness and of promotion of female role models hinders girls\u2019 and women\u2019s opportunities in STEM studies and careers; V. whereas there is a visible backlash in some Member States and there is a risk that gender equality could further slip down the agenda of Member States; 1. Regrets that at the high-level meeting on \u2018Accelerating the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls\u2019 held on 1 October 2020 during the UN General Assembly to commemorate the Beijing Convention, world leaders from 100 countries acknowledged that the overall progress in women\u2019s rights is far below what they committed to at the Beijing Convention in 1995; 2. Highlights that the UN Women report entitled \u2018 Gender equality: Women\u2019s rights in review 25 years after Beijing\u2019 ( 19 ) depicted how progress towards gender equality is actually faltering and hard-won advances are being reversed globally; 3. Notes with concern that the fifth review of the BPfA published by EIGE in 2020 highlighted that no European Member States completed the targets set at the Beijing Convention in 1995; regrets that EIGE\u2019s 2020 Gender Equality Index demonstrated that progress had stalled in achieving equality between women and men, and that despite efforts to improve gender equality yielding some results, persistent inequalities and gender gaps remain in the EU across all the areas covered in the BPfA; 4. Highlights that the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 are disproportionately affecting women and girls, exacerbating pre-existing gender inequalities and threatening to reverse the progress made until now; highlights, in this regard, that, according to UN Women estimates ( 20 ), the pandemic will push 47 million more women and girls below the poverty line at global level, bringing the total to 435 million, while it has exponentially increased gender-based violence and woman are losing their jobs and livelihoods faster as they are more exposed to hard-hit economic sectors; 5. Recognises that more women are being elected and appointed into decision-making positions, but regrets that progress is slow and that parity has only been achieved in a few EU Member States; 6.

Regrets that gender mainstreaming is not applied systematically across all EU policy areas and funding programmes; welcomes the introduction of gender mainstreaming as a horizontal priority in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027; calls on the Commission to ensure the implementation of systematic gender mainstreaming as a key strategy to support the realisation of gender equality, and to implement gender-responsive budgeting, practices and roadmaps in consultation with gender budgeting experts to ensure women and men benefit equally from public spending in all levels of budgeting and that women\u2019s perspectives are mainstreamed across all areas, with specific funds to address factors of inequalities such as violence against women and girls, including in the distribution of the Citizens, Rights and Values programme which is earmarked for the promotion of gender equality; 8. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop and implement concrete plans and a set of actions, matched with adequate earmarked funding, on the basis of the twelve areas of concern set out by the BPfA, especially on women and poverty, women and the economy, power and decision-making, women and violence, women and the environment, and women and health, in order to advance women\u2019s rights and the gender equality agenda, with a view to the upcoming Generation Equality Forum; 9. Regrets that the retrogressive tendencies being expressed in some countries as regards the questioning of the Istanbul Convention, the backlash against women\u2019s SRHR, and challenges to bodily autonomy and control of fertility have been exacerbated in recent years; strongly condemns the adoption of the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling implementing a de facto ban on abortion and the subsequent setback to women\u2019s SRHR in Poland and the unjustified excessive restrictions on access to abortion; 10. Recalls that women\u2019s rights are human rights, and they are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights, as stated at the Fourth World Conference on Women; 11. Urges the Commission and the Member States to monitor and improve the collection of comparable age, racial and ethnic origin and gender-disaggregated data in order to improve quantitative analysis and to design and implement EU policies that would better integrate a gender intersectional perspective; underlines the importance of EIGE as the provider of reliable and adequate sex-disaggregated data for the basis of legislative analysis and decision-making, and underlines the importance of securing and expanding the funding and capacities of EIGE; also urges EIGE and all other relevant EU institutions and agencies to work on and incorporate new indicators, such as on work poverty, time poverty or the value of care work; 12. Recalls that 46 million women and girls with disabilities live in the European Union and that half of all women of working age with disabilities are economically inactive; stresses the specific problems faced by women with disabilities and recalls that the material deprivation rate of women with disabilities is severe in all Member States; reaffirms therefore the need to further incorporate the gender perspective in the upcoming disability equality strategy 2021; 13. Calls on the Council and urges the Member States to approve and implement the Anti-Discrimination Directive and guarantee that multiple and intersectional forms of discrimination are eradicated in all EU Member States; Women and poverty 14. Highlights that gender remains a significant factor in patterns of poverty in the EU and that, although exclusion rates and gender poverty gaps vary considerably between countries, 23.3 % of women compared with 21.6 % of men are at risk of poverty ( 21 ); highlights that such risk increases significantly with age, intersecting with household composition, race or ethnic origin, disability and employment status; highlights that the gender pay, pension and care gaps are significant factors in the feminisation of poverty; 15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to address the feminisation of poverty in all its forms, including poverty in old age, particularly by factoring gender into the availability of and access to adequate pension entitlements in order to eliminate the gender pension gap, and by improving working conditions in feminised sectors and professions; 17.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 465/165 Thursday 11 February 2021 ( 21 ) In 2014, over 122 million people in the EU lived in households that were considered poor, i.e. they were at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE).

        "points out the importance of addressing the societal, economic and cultural undervaluation of jobs dominated by women, the need to combat such stereotypes and the over-representation of women in atypical forms of work; 16. Stresses that, while overcoming pension inequalities and safeguarding and increasing pensions in general, it is imperative that social security systems continue to exist in the public sphere, integrating the principles of solidarity and redistribution, and that the most strenuous efforts are made to combat precarious and unregulated work; 17. Calls on the Commission to present an anti-poverty strategy to fight against the feminisation of poverty, with a special focus on single-parent households headed by women; calls also on the Member States to implement specific social measures to combat the risk of social exclusion and poverty with regard to access to affordable housing, transport and energy; 18. Urges the Member States to take specific measures to combat the risk of poverty in old age and the Commission to include the gender dimension of poverty in its economic growth and social policy frameworks; welcomes the sex-disaggregated indicators in the mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights; underlines the need to mainstream the gender perspective using an intersectional approach in line with principles 2 and 3 of the Pillar and calls for better coordination between the European Pillar of Social Rights and the European Semester; calls on the Commission to develop and include a Gender Equality Index in the European Semester to monitor the gender effects of macroeconomic policies, as well as of the green and digital transitions; 19.

Underlines that changes in labour conditions such as teleworking can impact on the ability to disconnect and increase the workload, with women being affected far more than men owing to their predominant or traditional role as home and family caretakers; 29. Calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal that would take a holistic and life-long approach to care, taking into account the needs of both carers and those who receive care and setting minimum standards and quality guidelines for care throughout the life cycle, including for children, elderly persons and persons with long-term needs; 30. Calls on the Commission to examine women\u2019s participation in the labour market and ensure the meaningful participation of women in key decision-making bodies and in the design of gender-sensitive recovery and economic stimulus packages within the MFF and the Next Generation EU recovery plan; notes that the COVID-19 crisis is particularly affecting women in the labour markets, given the increase in unemployment rates among women; calls in this regard on the Commission to take specific measures to address the women\u2019s employment gap via targeted distribution under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and in which EU Member States demonstrate concrete actions to address women\u2019s unemployment, women\u2019s poverty and increased cases of violence against women and girls as obstacles preventing women\u2019s full participation in all areas of life, including employment; 31. Highlights the need to ensure the rights of women domestic workers to decent working conditions and equal social protection, by ensuring the ratification and implementation of the ILO Convention 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers; 32.

Within this framework it underlines its ambition to raise at least 30 % of the funds to be borrowed in the capital markets for the needs of NextGenerationEU through the issuance of bonds contributing to environmental objectives. The three Institutions agree to seriously explore the possibility of introducing rules establishing reporting obligations for the Member States, in order to ensure availability of information for the purpose of evaluating the contribution to environmental objectives of the funds borrowed in the capital markets. To that end, the Commission will endeavour to make a legislative proposal to this end during the first quarter of 2021. JOINT STATEMENT BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COMMISSION ON DATA COLLECTION FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND AUDITS The European Parliament and the Commission recall the need to ensure effective controls and audits for the purposes of avoiding double funding and preventing, detecting and correcting fraud, corruption and conflict of interests in relation to the measures supported by the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The two institutions consider essential that Member States collect and record data on final recipients and beneficiaries of Union funding in an electronic standardised and interoperable format and use the single data mining tool to be provided by the Commission. ADDITIONAL STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION ON DATA COLLECTION FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND AUDITS The European Commission recalls its unilateral declaration on this matter under the Common Provisions Regulation, which applies mutatis mutandis to Article 22 of the Recovery and Resilience Facility Regulation. COMMISSION STATEMENT ON THE METHODOLOGY FOR CLIMATE TRACKING The Commission considers that, in order to ensure consistency, the methodology of Annex VI of the Regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility should be incorporated in the Common Provisions Regulation.
