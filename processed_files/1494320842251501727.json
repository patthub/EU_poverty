        "1 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : I c e l a n d Summary: Performance in research and innovation The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research and innovation (R&I) performance in Iceland. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance and economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The indicator on excellence in science and technology takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The Innovation Output Indicator covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises, focusing on innovation output. The indicator on knowledge-intensity of the economy focuses on the economy\u2019s sectoral composition and specialisation and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products. Iceland More innovation for a more competitive economy Iceland has one of the highest R&D intensities in Europe and an excellent science base. However, a main challenge for the country is to transform this into economic competitiveness. Prioritisation and thematic-oriented funding would help Iceland, as a small country in a globalised world, to build a more effective R&I strategy. According to the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, which classifies Iceland among the innovation followers, it is the only country in which innovation has not improved over the 2006-2013 period. Evidence shows that Iceland\u2019s competitiveness in high-tech and medium-tech products and services is low, with a negative trade balance for high-tech and medium-tech products since 2000. In the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) 2013-2014, Iceland ranks 31 (out of 148 countries), maintaining its position from previous years. Despite significant difficulties in recent post- crisis years, Icelandic competitive strengths include the country\u2019s high-level educational system coupled with a relatively innovative business sector (27 th ). The country\u2019s strengths are its scientific outputs (high scores for the international co-publications and public-private co-publications). R&I were part of Iceland\u2019s recovery package for economic growth. However, in the years since the economic collapse, the higher education and research institutions have experienced budget cuts that amount to about a quarter of their pre-crisis budget, in real terms. In 2003, the establishment of the Science and Technology Policy Council (STPC), a key body giving core strategic advice on S&T policy developments, headed by the prime minister, centralised R&I governance at a high political level. The Ministry of Science, Higher education and Culture is responsible for the implementation of R&D policy in Iceland while the Ministry of Industries and Innovation deals with innovation policy. The Icelandic Centre for Research (Rannis) allocates most of the competitive funds and the Innovation Centre Iceland (ICI) deals with support services for innovation- and entrepreneurship-related activities.

        "2 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U has long been conceived as Icelandic structural weakness. Two external evaluations of the system have been conducted since the STPC was set up, and a focused international peer review of the Icelandic R&I system is currently being conducted in the context of the European Research Area and Innovation Committee (ERAC). In November 2013, the STPC adopted a new policy for the years 2013-2016 which focuses on the Iceland had an R&D intensity of 3.11 % in 2009, a relatively high level compared to the EU average of 2.07 % (2012). However, following the financial crisis that hit Iceland in 2008, R&D intensity went down to 2.4 % in 2011. In January 2011, (\u2018Iceland 2020\u2019 policy statement), Iceland set an R&D intensity target of 4 %, to be reached by 2020, with the private sector contributing 70 % of the total and the public sector contributing 30 %. The new STPC policy is setting a target of 3 % R&D intensity by 2016. Taking into consideration the cuts in R&D spending, achieving this target would appear to be difficult. Icelandic R&D intensity experienced an average annual growth of -2.8 % in 2007-2011 while the growth required to reach the 2020 target is much higher at 5.8 %. A significant share of total R&D investment in Iceland comes from the public sector. In 2011, the public sector accounted for 42 % of total R&D investment. The business sector accounted for 48 %, which shows a decline from 2007 when the share was 54.6 %. Business R&D expenditure experienced a negative average annual growth of -3.7 % in 2007-2011, reaching 1.26 % in 2011. Insufficient business enterprise expenditure on R&D is one of the key weaknesses of the Icelandic R&I system. Therefore, the new STPC policy (2013-2016) is putting emphasis on increasing funding for and supporting business expenditure on R&D (for example, tax incentives for start-ups). Since 2010, the year tax deductions for companies investing in R&D projects (up to 20 % of costs) were introduced, indirect government support to R&D has been increasing. 3 Investment Plan for Iceland 2013-2015 following priorities: increased efforts in building up human resources in science and innovation, more cooperation between universities, research institutions and companies aimed at increasing the system\u2019s efficiency, more public and private investment in R&I, and a strong focus on the quality and value creation of R&I (emphasis on evaluation and quality control). For the first time, the Council will follow up the policy with a single action plan which is currently being finalised.

        "3 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : I c e l a n d The STPC policy also addresses another challenge in the Icelandic R&D system and proposes increasing the level of competitive research funding, which accounted for only 15-20 % before the increase in 2013 3 , to around 25 % of competitive funding. However, by 2016, the Icelandic government intends to withdraw all the proposed increases in funding to competitive R&D funds. With the new act on public finances proposing a five-year budgetary plan, focused government planning The European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, signed in 1994, is the main pillar on which political and economic relations between Iceland and the European Union rests. It gives Iceland the right to participate in a range of EU programmes in areas such as research and education. The Icelandic Centre for Research (Rannis) coordinates and promotes Icelandic participation in collaborative international science and technology projects inside the European Research Area. In particular, Iceland places great emphasis on integration in Nordic R&D cooperation programmes, including the Nordic Research and Innovation Area. should be introduced which would create more financial stability for the users of R&D, too. Public expenditure on R&D (GOVERD +HERD) as a % of GDP experienced a negative average annual growth between 2007 and 2012 (-2 %). Mobilising private R&D funding in times of economic crisis is another challenge: the level of private-sector funding of R&D in Iceland is low and has declined since 2007.

        "4 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U As a whole, the Icelandic R&I system performs above the EU average for most of the indicators, with strengths in scientific production (public-private scientific co-publications and the high impact of the international co-publications) and very good results in terms of participation in the EU Framework Programmes. As of February 2014, 852 eligible proposals were submitted in response to 478 FP7 calls for proposals involving 1170 applicants from Iceland and requesting EUR 344 million in EU contributions. Iceland has the closest collaborative links in FP7 with the UK, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and France. The Icelandic economy is very knowledge-intensive, as illustrated by both the level of employment in knowledge-intensive activities and the high number of business researchers per thousand of the labour force. A challenge for Iceland is to increase the numbers of students participating in science, engineering and doctoral studies. The impressive growth observed in new doctoral graduates indicates that Iceland is on track to address this challenge. The number of foreign doctoral students and scientific publications within the 10 % most cited worldwide is above the EU average but below the average of the reference group countries. The biggest decrease was observed in the average annual growth of public expenditure on R&D and in the BERD financed from abroad. Iceland scores high in innovative SMEs, but it is important to note that business R&D intensity has been falling since 2007. Iceland\u2019s scientific and technological strengths The graph below illustrates the areas, based on the Framework Programme thematic priorities, where Iceland shows scientific and technological specialisations. Both the specialisation index (SI, based on the number of publications) and the revealed technological advantage (RTA, based on the number of patents) measure the country\u2019s scientific (SI) and technological (RTA) capacity compared to that at the world level. For each specialisation field it provides information on the growth rate in the number of publications and patents. 03 0.5 3.5 1 4 1.5 4.5 25 2.5 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada; Bocconi University, Italy Notes: ( 1 ) Values over 1 show specialisation; values under 1 show a lack of specialisation.

        "5 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : I c e l a n d Comparison of the scientific and technological specialisation in selected thematic priorities shows a mixed situation with some co-specialisations as well as some mismatches. Technology production is strongly specialised in biotechnology, food, agriculture, fisheries, and health. Iceland, together with Switzerland and the Netherlands, is among the countries with the highest scientific impact for health. In the case of health, and food, agriculture and fisheries, the co-specialisation in S&T over the last decade shows that Iceland has been successful in transferring knowledge from science to technology in those fields. However, there is no corresponding scientific specialisation for a strong technological performance in the field of biotechnology. On the other hand, the science created in the fields of security, and environment is not translated into technology. High growth rates of patenting in security, ICT, materials, and construction show the potential for increasing specialisation in those fields in the future. It is interesting to note that biotechnology and environment are among the fields in which Iceland is the most successful in FP7. However, this is not matched by S&T co-specialisation in those fields at the national level. Therefore, these sectors could be scrutinised more closely when evaluating the strengths of research performed at national level. Iceland is among those European countries with the highest scientific impact and has a high ratio of highly cited publications per total publications. Excellence in science is noted for most of the fields. As illustrated in the graph below, Iceland\u2019s strong scientific specialisation in the fields of environment, humanities, food, agriculture and fisheries, health, and socio-economic sciences matches the high impact of those fields above the world level. The graph below illustrates the positional analysis of Icelandic publications showing the country\u2019s situation in terms of scientific specialisation and scientific impact over the period 2000-2010. The scientific production of the country is reflected by the size of bubbles, which corresponds to the share of scientific publications from a science field in the country\u2019s total publications. \u0017 Iceland \u2013 Positional analysis of publications in Scopus (specialisation versus impact), 2000\u20132010 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada, based on Scopus Note: Scientific specialisation includes 2000\u20132010 data; the impact is calculated for publications of 2000\u20132006, citation window 2007\u20132009.

In general, the smaller countries, like Iceland and Luxembourg, are forced to specialise more and make strategic choices regarding their collaborative links. In the fields where Iceland is specialised in both science and technology, the ERA offers good opportunities for cooperation, in particular with Denmark, Latvia, Switzerland and Croatia in the field of health, and with Norway, Denmark, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Slovakia, Spain and Portugal in the food and agriculture sector.

        "6 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U The indicator places Iceland among medium-low performers. This is the result of low performance in the export share of medium-/high-tech goods where the country\u2019s performance is very low. Historically, Iceland is a resource-based economy with its fishing industry and energy being the main drivers of its economy. With no sizeable high- tech industry and a high share of food exports (fish), Iceland scores at a low level as regards the share of medium-/high-tech goods in total goods exports. As a result of its high share of air-transport services, the country scores better (slightly above the EU average) in knowledge- intensive service exports. Innovation Output Indicator The Innovation Output Indicator, launched by the European Commission in 2013, was developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU\u2019s performance against its main trading partners. It measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. The indicator focuses on four policy axes: growth via technology \u2013 (patents); jobs (knowledge- intensive employment); long-term global competitiveness (trade in mid/high-tech commodities); and future business opportunities (jobs in innovative fast-growing firms). The graph below enables a comprehensive comparison of Iceland\u2019s position regarding the indicator\u2019s different components. 2012 2010 KIA EU EU EU EU EU EU EU 75.0 100.0 25.0 50.0 0.0 GOOD SERV Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Eurostat, OECD, Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, DG JRC Notes: All data refer to 2012 except PCT data, which refer to 2010.
