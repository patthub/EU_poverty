Background context to child participation agenda within the country: \uf0b7 Historical development \uf0b7 Cultural attitudes and their influence (+ / -) Child participation is defined in the Law on Children\u2019s Rights which was adopted in 1998. The Law consists of 12 chapters, transitional provisions and reference to the EU Directives. The objective of the Law is to determine the rights of a child, freedoms and his/her protection, by taking into consideration that the child, as a physically and intellectually immature person, needs special protection and care. Law regulates also basic provisions regarding whether the child's behaviour shall be controlled and his/her responsibility determined, the rights of parents and other physical and legal persons, obligations and responsibility for securing a child's rights. The law also determines the system for protection of the child's rights, and the legal principles for the implementation. Child participation is discussed in Chapter 2 on basic child rights. Article 13 determines that: (1) A child has the right to express his/her own thoughts freely, and for this purpose to receive and to provide any kind of information, the right to be heard, as well as the right to awareness and religious freedom. The religious persuasion of a child, through 14 years of age, shall be determined by the parents. (2) A child has the right to freedom of association, in so far as far it does not endanger his/her health and life.(3) A child has the right to participate in self-administration in education, culture and sports fields. In any other fields which affect the child's interests, proper attention shall be paid to the child's point of view, in accordance with his/her age and maturity. Article 17. On child's rights to participate in developing the children's rights protection program determines that a child has the right him/herself, or through his/her own legal representatives, to participate in the development and implementation of children's rights protection programs.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 2 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) Since the adoption of this law in 1998, there have been several amendments, including the child\u2019s right to express his/her views on important issues, including child involvement in some types of activities Art.50.1, which are related with demonstration of appearance. For example, the Amendment: Art. 3.2.The state shall provide children's rights and freedoms to all children without any discrimination - regardless of a child's, his/her parent's, trustee's, or family member's race, nationality, sex, language, party membership, political and religious conviction, national, ethical or social origin, property or health status, birth, or other circumstances (amended in 2005), Art. 5. (2) emphasizes that children\u2019s organisations shall be protected (2005). The amendment to the article 6(5) defines that activity or inactivity, as a result of which a child's rights are not considered or which limit the child's personal rights and freedoms, shall be considered as immoral and unlawful (2005). One of the most important amendments concerns child\u2019s right to participate in self-administration in education, culture and sports fields. In any other fields which affect the child's interests, proper attention shall be paid to the child's point of view, in accordance with his/her age and maturity (Art.13(3), 2000.). The amendment on realisation of children's rights in cases of any restrictions determined by law for the protection of the national safety, public order, moral and health of residents, and protection of other persons' rights and freedoms, as well as the child's own security and protection, a child shall receive explanations on such restrictions as soon as an error in his/ her behaviour is noticed Art. 21(2), (2000). The amendment on the role of local governments define that local governments shall involve society, as well as co-ordinate the activity of public organisations, in guaranteeing children's rights (2009), which means that also children organisations participate in issues related with children\u2019s rights and their protection. The amendment in 2003 defines that the state and local governments shall provide financial support to public organisations for the realisation of programs dedicated to the interests of the family and children. It means that also children organisations have a right to receive financial support for the improvement of their activities, including expression of their opinions (art. 69(3)). The last amendment (2014) concerns defines that a child him/herself and other persons have the right to apply for help from children's rights protection institutions and other state and local government institutions, which execute activities anticipated in the law, if the father, mother or legal representative, employee of a children's care and upbringing and educational institution violate child's rights, treat him/her cruelly, or in any other way fail to observe the child's rights (Art.70.(2)).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 3 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) The law fits to all paragraphs of the United Nations Convention on Child Rights (UNCRC) Soon after the adoption of the Law, in 1999, Children Forum (CF) was established, which aimed at preparing children/youth leaders and support staff to facilitate local, regional and nation-wide processes of consultation with children. Children starting from primary school were engaged in assessment of the situation of children at the local level, development of solutions and proposals to the local decision makers, negotiation, development and implementation of local projects. Almost a thousand schools took part in defending and promoting children\u2019s rights in social and educational field. Training and project development, cooperation with local governments and state institutions through the initiative was implemented to solve the issues in sports, culture, security and social field. The child-friendly text of the UNCRC was popularized in Latvia. The cooperation with the NGO\u2019s of the Baltic countries was continued and seminars were organized to train the children/youth leaders. Particular attention was paid to child\u2019s individual creativity. Co-operation with the Parliament, the state authorities, municipalities and other NGOs and international organizations. CF prepared and provided information materials on children rights. Suggestions were proposed for policy documents and projects for the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Welfare. According to the resolution CF, in co-operation with the Parliament of Latvia, the Cabinet of Ministers and the Local Governments, works to achieve the development of children consultative commission established in each ministry; opinion of children and youth is expressed by the Children\u2019s Forum Representatives in the inter-ministerial councils, as well as at the sessions of Sub-commission on the Rights of the Child of the Latvian Parliament. b. How is Article 12 UNCRC reflected in legislation? Note: please include details of: \uf0b7 Relevant national legislative documents \uf0b7 Obligations imposed on authorities, bodies, and / or appropriate adults \uf0b7 Remedies for violations of these obligations Article 12 (UNCRC) is reflected in the Law On Children\u2019s Rights, adopted on 12.06.1998. There is also a paragraph in the Law on Patients\u2019 Rights (2009), which states that children from age 14 have a right to make a decision before a professional who undertakes a medical intervention (Art 13.) (www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=203008). The Regulations on Adoption takes into account the child\u2019s view \u2013 that he/she agrees to be adopted. Art. 5.3. Regulates that child\u2019s view has to be taken into account if the child has reached the age of 12. The Regulations mention that a view of a younger child needs to be heard. (Art.10). However, that Article regulates that the opinion of older children (aged 12+) has to be taken into account. For example, Art.5.3 defines that the adoption of a child who is at least 12 years old is possible only in a case when a child agrees to be adopted. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 4 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) Art.181 defines that a child who is under guardianship, has a right to have personal relationships and close contacts with his/her brothers, sisters, grandparents and other persons (if that is not against child's interests). Art.185 defines that a child has a right to approach the Custody Court in cases, when he/she meets unjustified restrictions or other dispute has developed. Art.189 of the Civil Law defines Children may conclude all manner of lawful transactions with their parents. During minority, such transactions may be concluded only with the participation of the Orphan\u2019s court, which shall appoint guardians in this case. Those laws impose obligations on authorities to respect children\u2019s views in several contexts. c. How are responsibilities for implementation organised? Is there one entity or body with oversight on implementation of UNCRC Article 12 at national level? In Latvia, there is the State Inspectorate for Protection of Children\u2019s Rights (BTI) which oversees the protection and respecting all children\u2019s rights. The Inspectorate is an institution of direct administration supervised by the Ministry of Welfare that provides the supervision and control of the observance of regulatory enactments in the field of protection of the rights of the child. In accordance with the By-law of the State Inspectorate for Protection of Children\u2019s Rights (2005) (Law On Local governments , the functions of the Inspectorate includes supervision and observance whether and how the normative regulations are implemented, including child\u2019s right to be heard. Inspectorate has organised the operation of a hotline telephone service in the field of protection of the rights of the child, where child\u2019s opinion is heard. d. How is children\u2019s participation defined in national legislation? - Please include a full definition, as set out in legalisation. The Law on Children\u2019s Rights paragraph 13, defines: (1) The child has a right to freely express his/her opinion, and for this purpose to receive any type of information; the child has the right to be listened to, as well as rights on freedom of religion and conscience.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 5 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) e. Which children are covered by the provisions for Article 12 UNCRC in national legislation? Please identify how / whether it addresses \uf0b7 the individual child, \uf0b7 children as a group or \uf0b7 specific groups/ages of children Please note any exemptions. In general, all children are covered by the legislation. However, various aspects of child participation differ depending on factors, which are officially specified as the age of a child and their maturity. In practice these conditions mean that there is particular support to children from vulnerable groups. Art.3 of the Law on Children's Rights defines the principle of equality of all children and child rights (amendment enforced since 2005). That paragraph means that all children have to be heard regardless of a child parent's, trustee's, or family member's race, nationality, sex, language, party membership, political and religious conviction, national, ethical or social origin, property or health status, birth, or other circumstances As concerning adoption, all children's views have to be respected. At the same time, consent to be adopted is necessary for children who are aged 12 and older (Adoption rules, Art.9,http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=72987 ). Another example, where the age of a child is specified, is the Patient Law (http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=203008). If a child is under 14, his/her representative should agree about the treatment, and child's consent is necessary, if a child is older than 14. (Art.13.) The Custody law, Civil Law, addresses both children as individual child, children as a group and specific groups of children \u2013 children left without parental protection, orphan children and \u201cvulnerable\u201d groups of children. All the other legislation addresses children both as a group, and as an individual child. f. What other drivers of participation exist in the country beyond obligations to implement article 12 of the UNCRC to promote the participation of children? There are several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which follow the children\u2019s rights agenda or child active participation. There are more than 60 children and youth organizations, the BTI mentions 13 Umbrella organizations that work on various aspects of children and youth rights (www.bti.lv). Some of them focus on children in general; others work on specific groups of children, such as orphans, foster children, children in SOS villages or children with special needs. Herewith a few organisations are mentioned. Children's Forum of Latvia is a politically and ideologically independent, democratic, voluntary organization with the support of national and international experts of child protection and childhood.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 6 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) National Parliament, governmental institutions and municipalities, other non-governmental organisations and entrepreneurs work with the Children\u2019s Forum to involve children and young people in decision-making and to promote respect for the child rights and child participation in the European Union. Children\u2019s organisations have participated in the National Programme \u201cLatvia Fit for Children 2010 \u2013 2012\u201d. Children Forum mentions that children have always begin by listening to them and Latvian consultation with children on the EC Communication \u201cTowards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child. SOS Children\u2019s Villages (initially started by SOS-Kinderdorf International, Austria (Latvia since 1997), which aims to meet the needs and protect the interests and rights of children), working in Latvia in 1997. SOS Children's Villages in Latvia provides a long-term family based care for children who have lost their parents. One of main principles of the organisation \u2013 every child has to be heard. SOS villages have organised the first study on opinion of children living in residential care. Latvian S ave the Children (SC) is a children\u2019s rights protection organization. The basic principles of SC are : to strive to secure child rights where the country or regional governments have failed. SC had worked on the first hotline for children. SC has involved children in the National children\u2019s Report to the United Nations on the Implementation of the UN Convention on the rights of the child in Latvia (2006).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 7 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) There are three main directions in the work of Scouts: participate in out-door activities (camping, touristic walks, participate in strategic games), acquire new skills (leadership, support, collaboration), participate in doing \u201cgood jobs\u201d (every day, during charity activities). g. What are the budgetary resources and relevant financial programmes aimed at the promotion and implementation of child participation in each Member State? How visible are they? The budgetary resources for child participation would be held within the budget of the State Inspectorate on Protection of Children\u2019s Rights (BTI). The work of BTI is rather visible, but as child participation is a small part of its remit, the exact budget allocated to the promotion and implementation of child participation within the total budget is not specified. Therefore it cannot be defined as being visible. ",

Tools, Measures, Processes and Scope by Sector Sector Examples Covered by legislation relating to Article 12 (Yes / No?) Sector overview Please include brief details for the following: Main legislation / policy directives Which children (e.g. any age distinctions / measures for vulnerable groups) If possible, also outline the main forms of participation . Some examples might include: i. Consultation via surveys, workshops ii. Collaboration in decision making iii. Child led projects /research iv. Training and recruitment of professionals v. Producing child friendly information (e.g. children\u2019s leaflets, quizzes, websites) Strengths and weaknesses Please give a brief overall indication of: - Strengths / areas of good practice - Weaknesses / gaps or insufficiencies 1. National Government & overall policy- making Parliament, Government Departments \u2013 Youth Issues Unit, Ministry of Education and Sciences, BTI Yes \uf0b7 Law on Protection of Children\u2019s Rights, Law on Youth, Regulations on Training of Specialists on Youth Issues. \uf0b7 There are surveys and workshops where children are consulted on such issues as youth and family (for example, the URBAct project run by Riga City Council as well as local and regional studies). But the research is not conducted on a regular basis. \uf0b7 There is no evidence of child-led projects, except in small projects run by school \u2018Pupil councils\u2019 and a project run by SOS villages \uf0b7 Since 2010 training and recruitment of youth workers has been based on Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers \uf0b7 There is child-friendly information published by The State Inspectorate for Protection of Children's Rights (BTI) on the following topics \u2013 safe internet, safe \u201cstopping the care\u201d (dro\u0161a stopo\u0161ana\u201d), friendly school, friendly family, \u201cknow your rights\u201d, and other issues. Strengths \uf0b7 Child participation issues are based in the legislation. In addition children are invited to shadow politicians, Ministers and other State and regional officials.

",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 9 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) \uf0b7 Another form of participation is Youth Parliament (Jaunie\u0161u Saeima) The activity started in 2011, when the Youth Parliament was elected (77 young persons, the number differs each year). Youth Parliament has developed 4 Declarations \u2013 on Child and youth participation in the development of the educational and cultural environment; On Children and youth participation in the solution of European Union issues; on Child and Youth contribution to the development of the Latvian economy; On Children and Youth participation in the development of modern Latvian society. So far, there have been four Youth Parliaments. Each Parliament adopts four resolutions. For example, the topics of Declarations of the Youth Parliament have been as follows: On immediate activities to fight the drugs: On promotion of youth employment; On basic knowledge in economics and development of self-initiatives; On individualised approach towards pupils' needs in education. Weaknesses \uf0b7 Research has a small role in policy planning, and is not integrated into policy development. There is little funding available for the evidence-base. \uf0b7 Child opinion rarely informs policy development. 2. Local and regional government & services Planning, housing, the environment and sustainable development Planning \u2013 yes: housing for orphans, No \u2013 other children The activities of local governments are regulated under the Law on Local Governments defines the autonomous functions of local governments Art 22): inventory of children, ensure child rights protection; \uf0b7 On a local level housing planning only takes place for orphans after they leave a residential care institution. Housing planning does not cover any other group, such as children in care whose parents have had their parental rights removed. \uf0b7 Each town municipality has a youth policy strategy, which includes participation. Youth policy is also an integrated part of the sustainable development plan for municipal development strategic planning. \uf0b7 Municipal councils should support all children and youth organisations. Strengths: \uf0b7 Municipal development plans have to take into account children/youth views. \uf0b7 Accommodation (housing) for orphans has to be planned. \uf0b7 Some municipalities (Riga, Cesis) monitor child/youth participation, organise surveys, and include these results in their strategies. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Latvia March 2015 10 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) Weaknesses \uf0b7 Only orphans\u2019 views are taken into account on housing issues, not other children. \uf0b7 Planning and environmental issues in relation to child/youth participation depend, not only on individual municipalities and their understanding of the importance of child participation, but also on the activity of youth specialists and cooperation with children and youth organisations. 3. Care Child protection, alternative care, adoption Mainly yes Child Protection is regulated by the Law on Children\u2019s Rights. A legal basis for adoption is regulated by: Civil Law (Civillikums, Art. 162-176); Law on Custody Courts and Parish Courts (Par b\u0101ri\u0146ties\u0101m un pagastties\u0101m), and the Law on Children\u2019s Rights (B\u0113rnu ties\u012bbu aizsardz\u012bbas likums); the adoption procedure is regulated by the Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers No 111 On the procedure of adoption, 2003). However there is: 1. No consultation via surveys (except a qualitative study within the EU PROGRESS programme 2. No collaboration in decision making. 3. No child-led projects /research. Strengths \uf0b7 BTI organises information campaigns for custody courts where new aspects in legislation on child protection and children\u2019s rights are introduced. \uf0b7 BTI/Ministry of Welfare organises training for foster parents.

National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) 4. Training for adults as well as a pilot study to produce information for children from residential care institutions does exist. Weaknesses Adoption and foster families are not widespread phenomenon. Training does not develop participation skills; children are passive recipients. 4. Asylum and immigration All asylum and immigration procedures Yes Regulated by the Law on Asylum (Patv\u0113ruma likums, 1998): all children have the same rights. Children asylum seekers have to be represented by the Custody Court or guardian or Head of the Institution of Child care (Art. 6), Discussion with juvenile asylum seekers have to be done by official who has necessary knowledge on needs of juvenile (Art.6). Decision about the accommodation of juvenile asylum seeker is based on the opinion and interests of a child in accordance of his/her age and maturity (Art.8). According to the Law, the local government has to provide access to education. Ministry of Education and science makes a list of schools that provide general education to juvenile asylum seekers (Art.27)in accordance with the Education law Latvia has very few children asylum seekers. During the period 2008.-2012 there have been 11 juvenile persons (Patv\u0113ruma mekl\u0113t\u0101ju izmitin\u0101\u0161ana Latvij\u0101, EMT, Riga, 2013, p.21). \uf0b7 Due to very small number of child asylum seekers no information on child participation is available. Potential problems could arise in relation to use of children\u2019s native language. \uf0b7 Due to small number of juvenile asylum seekers (11 during 5 years) there is a small experience in work with the specific groups of children.

What influence do policy and recommendations at EU level have in developing legislation policy and practice for implementing Article 12 in your country? The amendments to the Law on Children\u2019s Rights have been introduced. Support to youth participation projects have been introduced at both national and local levels. The \u2018Youth in Action\u2019 Programme is an EU programme to increase child and youth participation (age group 13-30). Youth organisations and youth groups apply for projects to increase their participation through training, mobility and various activities. The objective is to promote youth activities and mobility, to work with voluntary services for youth, non-formal learning and youth information programs and projects as well as support the link between non-formal learning and lifelong education. The programme helps to get new knowledge, skills and experience, to develop own projects, to actively participate in the social processes, to learn new cultures. b.

The respondents \u2013 expert have emphasized the importance of the Law in the implementation of children rights in practice. Experts did not explicitly mention any other laws on child participation. One expert has emphasized the Youth law and supporting ministerial (Child and family Ministry until 2008, and Ministry of Education and Science since then) policy documents on increasing youth participation \u2013 further development of Pupils\u2019 school councils, and Pupils Councils on municipal level (for example, Riga Pupils\u2019 Council). According to governmental experts, legislation is adequate for the implementation of the Recommendation. The Recommendation on Child participation has mainly implemented through school councils and Youth Councils at the municipal level. Other examples of practice were not highlighted in expert interviews with governmental representatives. The parental organisations have mentioned the need for single definition of children with special needs, and normative acts that might favour participation of children with special needs. b. What have been the main challenges and barriers to implementing this legislation and policy /developing participation in practice? How have they been addressed? Stakeholders (both governmental and non-governmental) have mentioned the main obstacles for increasing child participation: \uf0b7 There is a lack of funding for the implementation of effective policy, which is a barrier to effective participation; \uf0b7 there is a clear need to raise awareness on the requirements for child participation among state, regional, and municipal policy makers; \uf0b7 Awareness needs to be raised among children about their role in participating in the decision-making process. \uf0b7 BTI is the main organisation involved with issues of child participation; however their duties are wide- ranging and are restricted by their capacity and funding resources. \uf0b7 Two desk officers on youth policy within the Department of Policy Initiatives and Development at the Ministry of Education and Science are the main persons involved in coordination of youth participation; however their duties are wide-ranging and are restricted by their capacity and funding resources.

What is the situation of child participation in sectors that are covered by relevant legislation? The legislation on child participation covers all children. However children with special needs are not listened to and their interests are expressed from a parental perspective (Interview with representatives of parental organisation). Children\u2019s right are implemented and they have the opportunity to express their views. According to the Law On Local governments, the Government elaborates the development programme, where they included a chapter on youth. Basically the strategy and annual budget plans includes funding, tools and activities, which focus on leisure activities, organisation of afterschool activities, and hobbies, and some funding for youth projects. Some municipalities provide a local budget for child participation activities within project funding. For example, Cesis municipality has developed a project \u201cYouth House\u201d (2006), and funds projects increasing youth participation. The city/district Youth Council (C\u0113su novada Jaunie\u0161u dome), where all the youth can spend leisure time, discuss various issues. Within a project \u201cTowards the goal\u201d(\u201ePret\u012b m\u0113r\u0137im!\u201d), funded from the state budget within the State youth policy, 2012), the Youth house is developed as youth information point, where youth can have access to internet, new computers, booklet on youth possibilities in Cesis and Latvia as a whole. Cesis has funded the project on Summer camp for participation of children from residential care and children linked to probation services. Project has been a part of EU funding. d. What is the situation of child participation in sectors that are not covered by relevant legislation? \uf02d What are the non- legislative measures and tools available for those sectors? \uf02d What participatory processes are in place? Non-legislative measures and tools can be characterised in terms of local municipal activities organised by pupils\u2019 and youth councils There is another activity cofounded by the Foundation of social integration, named \u201ctuesi.lv\u201d (you are.lv), which promotes the good practice results of active young people and their participation in the creation of their own projects (www.tuesi.lv).

What additional legislation or policy might be needed to address the gaps or weaknesses identified at e. above? According to governmental experts, there was no need for additional legislation. Instead there was a challenge to develop effective policy measures of implementation, which had a particular emphasis on child participation. Governmental experts emphasize that the experts from the European Commission have positively assessed the Latvian legislation on child participation. At the same time, it is mentioned by governmental experts that both government and the municipalities try to do their best to implement the policies. The main obstacles for more effective implementation of the legislation is related to: 1. very small, insufficient state funding, 2. no regular research to monitor levels of child participation. Majority of the activities on increasing the child participation (for example, trainings for Pupils' Councils) are scarcely or not funded from the state budget or municipal funding, and realised by volunteers.

Please provide an overview of the following: \uf02d Predominant attitudes towards children\u2019s participation \uf02d Drivers of positive/negative attitudes \uf02d Challenges in changing attitudes and additional legislation needed at national and EU level The predominant attitudes towards child participation have improved during the last 15-20 years. Before that, the child participation was understood as subordinated to the adult guidelines, programmes and work plans developed by adults. Children were viewed as passive recipients of activities initiated by adults. The child active participation was not easily understood by adults \u2013 parents, teachers, and children themselves. Governmental experts have expressed the view that attitudes towards child participation cannot change greatly during the short period. Education, training, and participation in various international projects on youth leadership have helped children and young people to develop debating skills and to get their voice heard. National policy makers have understood the need to listen to children\u2019s voices, and good political will is demonstrated by the introduction of the \u201cShadow day\u201d to Parliamentary deputies in 2009 (http://www.saeima.lv/lv/sabiedribas-lidzdaliba/enu-diena-1). Since then every year children can apply to be a shadow to a parliamentary deputy. The number of \u201cshadows\u201d has increased from about 120 (in 2009) to 250 in 2014. Those children and youth willing to participate as shadows to the politicians, had to write an application and motivation letter, and had to answer the quiz. The youngest child \u2013 shadow to a politician has been a 9 year old girl, but the majority of \u201cshadows\u201d are between 14 and18 years old. However, according to experts, though children\u2019s views are listened to they are not acted upon.

The example shows the most common measures of effective and meaningful participation. 3. The evaluation of the work done at the national conferences of the School Councils. d. What nationally recognised examples of children\u2019s participation are considered to be good practice ? And why? 1. State Agency for Child protection BTI highlights the \u201cchild-friendly school 1 \u201d as an example of child participation activity. The mission of the Child friendly school is to improve the socio-psychological climate at school and relations between pupils, teachers, parents and school administration. BTI have offered financial help to organise a conference on the subject (April 2013). The aim is to give opportunities to pupils to influence their school life. 2. Talsu district have their say at school level concerning conditions at school. In a village of Valgale, children have initiated the changes in the schedule of the public transportation within the district, because children were not able to participate in afterschool activities due to inconvenient bus schedule 2 . This is an evidence of the role of children in affecting changes. 3. Riga \u201cPupils\u2019 Councils\u201d is a well organised school children/youth network with well organised structure (5 committees) and regular activities and regular child participation on local level. The work of the Pupils\u2019 Council is organised in accordance with a work plan. 4. Riga Pupils' Council together with youth clubs (for example, \u201cKnagis\u201d (Peg)) and City Youth Councils organised a conference \u201cYouth work reality and perspective\u201d. The objective was to promote a discussion on youth interests on municipal level, funding opportunities for youth initiative, youth employment, etc. Although those are local examples, these examples are chosen as good practice examples because they demonstrate various aspects of child participation that have visible results . 1 http://www.bti.gov.lv/lat/draudziga_skola/kustiba_draudziga_skola/ 2 http://www.jaunatneslietas.lv/jaunumi/702-aizstavot-savas-intereses-jauniesi-versas-pec-palidzibas-talsu-novada-dome ",

Children in residential care are financed by the State for children aged 0-2 (or 0-4 if severely disabled) or by local government if aged 2-18. Young people leave the residential care when they are 18 years old.

The Law on Children\u2019s Rights concerns all children under the age of 18. Article 13 defines that child has a right to express his/her thoughts and should be listened to, as well as rights to participate in self- government in education, culture and sports. In all other areas related to child interests, their view should be taken into account in accordance with their age and maturity. The legal framework has defined the necessity to organise school Councils with participation of children/youth. The Education law (Art.30, Art.31) defines that the school headmaster has to organise the school Council. The National Centre for Education has a duty to develop and provide methodological support to the school administration and school councils in the development of the school councils.

Municipalities, municipal orphan homes, children\u2019s homes have primary responsibility for children. The Latvian SOS Children Association ( http://www.sosbernuciemati.lv/en) is involved in implementing child participation of this specific group of children at SOS villages. The Association participates in the Alliance of Alternative Child Care, and as a member of Alliance cooperates with Latvian State Agency on child protection, and with the Ministry of Welfare. The Association organises training for children and youth in care and aftercare, depending on project funding. In some regions the Orphan society also implements child participation. .

How do they work in practice? \uf0b7 What structures or forums and feedback mechanisms exist to support participation? \uf0b7 To what extent has the agenda for participation been shaped by children on their own terms? In some child care institutions, there are formal children\u2019s councils. According to interviews with children from the Institutions, children have no experience and skills how to participate in decision making and no experience to listen. They do not participate in the youth leader forums, and even do not know about existence of child or youth forums. The child participation policy for children\u2019s activation in the decision making at least on institutional level. A good practice example is the SOS Children\u2019s Villages Association \u2019s activity named Peer Research \u201cStarting the independent life after out-of-family care\u201d,within which youth care leavers were trained and made a study on peer experience in institutions and life after institutions. ( SOS Children\u2019s Villages Latvia is a social charity organization that provides a long-term family based care for children without parents. Their work is based on a child-cantered approach, taking into consideration child\u2019s individual needs and rights.) In 2012, the Latvian SOS Children villages organised the first peer research: \u201cStart of independent life after the institutional care\u201d. 10 young people who themselves have experienced the out-of-family care at SOS Children villages or orphan houses have been trained and performed a study of the out-of-family care system. 100 young people aged 15-29, who was planning to leave the care or have already left the care, have been interviewed. The research report provides information of limited participation experience and noted that the Association should organise some project activities to improve the skills necessary for participation.

No definitions were identified for either quality or effectiveness od participation, nor were any mechanisms defined by experts. Less effective practice appears to be the formal structures that have been established e.g. the children\u2019s councils or complaints procedures. While these forms allow participation, in the case of written complaints by institutionalised children to the State Agency of Child Protection, children who made the complaints consider that their opinion (complaints) have not been taken into account. These forms are less effective has children are not given the wider support and skill development to fully maximise the opportunity to participate. Good practice tends to emerge from NGO organisations, where more effective forms of participation are in the form of peer research, such as the SOS Villages peer research project on the \u201cStart of independent life after the institutional care. This has proven more effective as appropriate support was provided. ",

Where is this strongest / weakest? \uf0b7 What are the main barriers and challenges, and what additional legislation, policy or culture change is needed to achieve full participation? (identify national and EU actions as appropriate) There is some information about success of child participation in decision making. For example, the Youth parliament has developed Declarations and recommendations for the National Parliament. (http://jauniesusaeima.lv/#/?t=/1/2/3/4/5) The Youth Parliament works on concrete declarations that are submitted the National Parliament and are discussed at the Parliamentary Committees. For example, the third Youth Parliament worked on declarations in four main fields: development of sustainable rational educational systems, child and youth health policy, national economy and increasing competitiveness, and children and youth participation on the issues of European Union. Youth Parliament members have opportunities to be heard, their ideas are discussed and later voted at the Parliament Committees. The work of the Youth Parliament can be assessed as successful participation and has influenced Parliament\u2019 decision on youth issues. Both governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders have expressed a view that a culture around promoting child participation in policy-making decisions needs to be developed at all levels: institutional, regional and national. According to research, these children out of family care are all but invisible: for example, in one case children complained about the Director of an institution but their voice was not taken into account. There are cases, however, when children\u2019s complaints about carers have been taken into account and their violent or abusive carers were dismissed. One good practice example was the participation of a child from a foster family in a European Conference \u201cFramework, Quality, and Impact of Young Europeans\u2019 Learning Mobility\u201d, 2010. According to a qualitative study (Trapenciere, 2011), children from the orphan houses and foster care have fewer opportunities to participate in any projects, and mobility projects in particular, and share their views internationally. In this case the author of the Report had an opportunity to involve the child from a foster family in the international conference. That was the first opportunity for the girl to participate in any international event in her life, to be listened by European youth (and adults), to be involved in a skills training workshop. (Before the conference there have been discussions whether this particular group of risk children should be involved in any youth projects with mainstream youth). Nongovernmental stakeholders have expressed the view that there is a need to improve the normative regulations, in particular, on the topic of participation of children from the out-of-family care. According to the NGO stakeholders, the policy and culture of child participation within institutional care needs to be developed. ",

Those children with less severe disabilities attend regular schools, but those children with severe disabilities attend special boarding schools. Recently, this group has a better access to education and training in public schools. However, according to experts the expression of the thoughts of children with severe disabilities and their participation in any decisions and their views on improvement of their conditions is almost non- existent.

Disabled Children\u2019s interests are represented by their parents\u2019 organisations. There are no specific special needs or disabled children organisations in Latvia. The parents are united within various organisations to promote the interests of their children in education and training, arts, leisure and recreation (e.g. summer camps), and healthcare. There is collaboration between NGO \u201cApeirons\u201d (http://www.apeirons.lv/w, which is an NGO named \u201cDisabled people and their friends\u201d (www.apeirons.lv) and the State Agency for Protection of Children Rights (BTI). There is limited evidence of child participation and training for participation: the only example suggested by governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders was an ESF project on the risk of social exclusion of youth with special needs http://www.ppf.lu.lv/v.3/eduinf/files/2009/ESF_koncepcija.pdf (Soci\u0101l\u0101s atstumt\u012bbas riskam pak\u013cauto jaunie\u0161u un iek\u013caujo\u0161as izgl\u012bt\u012bbas atbalsta sist\u0113mas izveides nost\u0101dnes).

Participation occurs within special projects developed for children with special needs. The best examples of children\u2019s participation are different types of activities by children with special needs. For example, in Cesis district, within the project \u201cMechanisms of social integration for children and youth with special needs\u201d there have been activities devoted to social inclusion of children with special needs into the local society. In 2014/2015, This is an opportunity for children with special needs to meet publically, to learn new skills and later also to express their views on the activities. Children with special needs express their views in the evaluation of the project, their needs for future activities to become integrated into society http://www.cesis.lv/lv/sakums/aktualitates/izglitiba/projekta- aktivitates-bernu-un-jauniesu-ar-speci. Participation of children with special needs takes place mainly at local level. The expert from the municipality has mentioned a good practice example of child participation in the youth centre \u201cOpen Youth centre JACi\u201d, which is a non-formal education organization financed by local municipality, where disabled children and youth could meet http://jacis.blogs.lv. The objectives of the JACi are: \uf0b7 to develop and to organize youth leisure time and non-formal education activities; \uf0b7 to involve youth in the local and international youth projects; \uf0b7 to develop tolerance, understanding and respect to other cultures; \uf0b7 to provide necessary information about healthy life style, studies and work possibilities; \uf0b7 to promote youth active participation in society and voluntary work; \uf0b7 to support children/youth from social risk groups/ disadvantaged families and to organize activities for them; \uf0b7 to develop youth work in the city. The JACi children and youth centre welcomes children and youth aged 12 \u2013 25. Different kinds of activities are provided by JACis. Children participation in the various activities of JACi is a very good aspect of involvement in any public activities. Earlier they had very limited opportunities to come together, to choose the activities they want, and to evaluate the activities according to their needs and interests. It means that the activities they participate are largely based on the needs they have expressed, and not only offered by adults. They have access to Internet, play games, participate in youth projects and realize their own ideas. All activities depend on the interests and needs of youth and children (Hip-Hop festival, Pop-iela festival, writing and realizing of small cultural projects, discussions, meetings with Erasmus students and EVS volunteers.

No definition of \"quality\" or \"effectiveness\" exists. So far, there has not been a wide variety of activities, therefore all activities have to be evaluated as being qualitative and effective, because they provide the opportunity to participate. All disabled children's participation in organised activities should be evaluated as being good example and effective, because for many years, children with special needs have been excluded from mainstream society (staying in special schools or at home). Within the projects, they had opportunities to come out of their closed environment. There is no information about bad practice.

The municipal expert has mentioned the benefits for children with special needs which are that children increase their self-esteem and feel more satisfied with the improved activities within the centre. The main barrier is that children with special needs are seen as not able to participate in decision making. The challenge therefore is to develop the culture of child participation within this specific group.

The Law on Children\u2019s Rights concerns all children; however the issue of Euro orphans is a very new and rapidly increasing phenomenon. Starting from 2009, when the unemployment increased due to economic crises in Latvia, many people started to emigrate from Latvia. Many of them left their children behind with grandparents, adult siblings or even juvenile siblings, friends of parents or even by themselves; those children are called \u201cEuro orphans\u201d. According to research (Trapenciere I., Trapenciere A., http://www.isa-sociology.org/buenos-aires-2012/ ), these children are at risk of social exclusion, sometime at the risk of poverty, when their parents do not provide their children with necessary resources. Therefore new normative acts needed to be developed to increase parental responsibility on their children. Parents, who leave the country, have to register at the municipality and to sign an authorization about the person responsible for the child during their absence\u2013 in case of health, behaviour or other problems. In those cases, when children have unacceptable behaviour and parents (when being abroad) are not able to control them and to improve the child\u2019s situation, parents may be deprived from parental rights.

Developing participation in practice \uf0b7 In what contexts and for what purpose does participation typically / less typically occur? Children staying in the Correctional institution participate in the School Council regularly. The meetings of the school Council take place in accordance with the meeting plan, and all the members are invited to participate. Correctional institutions are a rather \u201cclosed\u201d environment, and therefore there is no publically available information about Children organised participation. There is no information about Forums or feedback mechanisms. ",

How do they work in practice? \uf0b7 What structures or forums and feedback mechanisms exist to support participation? \uf0b7 To what extent has the agenda for participation been shaped by children on their own terms? It is not possible to discuss the agenda for participation with children because it is a closed type institution. Effectiveness \uf0b7 How are \u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018effectiveness\u2019 defined, and what influences inform these definitions? \uf0b7 What forms of participation have proven more / les effective and why? \uf0b7 Where does good / bad practice exist, and what does it look like? No definition. Good practice example \u2013 within the ESF project \u201cStep by step\u201d children from correctional institutions could meet children and youth from NGOs e.g. Red Cross, NGO \u201cTrue love waits\u201d, and religious youth organisations ( http://lskj.lv/vai-jauniesi-uzsakusi-pasaules-glabsanu-projekts-%E2%80%9Esoli-pa- solim-ka-mes-tuvojamies-nospraustajiem-merkiem/). . This is a good example, because children from correctional institution had an opportunity to participate in activities with other children, could discuss important topics for themselves. It is a good practice example, because children from youth organisation due to participation in the project could break the stereotypes on children \u2013 offenders. It helped both groups of children to understand the other group, to break the stereotypes on themselves and the \u201cothers\u201d. Impact \uf0b7 How successful has children\u2019s participation been in influencing decisions within this setting / for this group? \uf0b7 What is the evidence for the benefits of participation for children and adults? Where is this strongest / weakest? The project has helped imprisoned children to develop positive thinking, increase self-esteem and to develop social skills. They could offer their own developed activities to others, to develop skills to plan activities, to feel useful, and discussion skills important for participation http://www.ievp.gov.lv/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=243:csu-audzinanas-iestdes- nepilngadgajiem-jauniei-soli-pa-solim-lau-stereot .

Description of sector/setting and profile of children involved In Latvia, SOS Children\u2019s Villages runs two Villages - Islice and Valmiera. Each SOS Children's Village has 12 residential houses. These villages provide an alternative environment for children to grow up in when they are no longer able to remain in the parental home. The villages house children from 0-18. The specific example of peer research involved a sample of 100 children and youth aged 15-29 being interviewed about their preparation to independent life. The interviewers were 10 young people who had just turned 18 and who have experienced out-of-family care (institutions, SOS villages, foster families). Description of example/type of participation The opportunity to participate in the research project as a researcher was advertised amongst the residents of the two villages. 10 young researchers were recruited and trained to interview their peers. The focus of the research was on the living conditions within the institutions and the aftercare support and experiences after young people leave care. While the overall topic and research questions were devised by adults, the young researchers had the opportunity to comment on the topics covered and suggest others. Between September and December 2012, the peer research project \u201eStarting independent life after out-of-family care\u201d (http://www.sosbernuciemati.lv/lv/ko-mes-daram/bernu-interesu-aizstaviba/1879/) was conducted. Outcomes The young people were trained to have in-depth discussions about their peers\u2019 perspectives of independent life after the child care system. One of the main findings of the study by young people indicated a lack of financial support, while noting that the emotional and moral support for them is also very important. Based on the results of the study proposals were prepared by SOS Children\u2019s Villages and submitted to the Ministry of Welfare and the State Children Rights Protection Inspectorate in 2013 to run a programme of discussions and seminars for professionals highlighting the results. The young people involved as researchers reported increased self-esteem and improved knowledge on issues related to independent life after leaving the institution as a result of their participation.
