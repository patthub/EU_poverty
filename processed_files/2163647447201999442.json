        "1 Foreword by Arno Metzler Populism in the EU is currently at its highest levels since the 1930s. The average populist vote in EU Member States now stands at 24%, up from 8.5% in the year 2000. Hence, we must all ask ourselves at which in the last two decades did mainstream politics fall out of favour with our citizens ? What has caused the proliferation of populism and Euroscepticism ? What role can civil society play in limiting its propagation ? These are fundamental questions that must be asked and answered, if we, civil society are to help the public to become aware of the extent to which populistic approaches can endanger our democratic values. In this context, it is with great pleasure that I commend to you the study \u2018 Societies outside Metropolises: the role of civil society organisations in facing populism \u2019, which was commissioned by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), at the request of the Diversity Europe Group, the Group which represents civil society organisations. It is precisely because our Members represent such a wide spectrum of socio-professional sectors that we consider it our duty to use these networks and to raise awareness among citizens of the dangers of populism. Our value added lies in our access to local, regional and national civil society and citizen groups and we must put this value added at the service of \u2018Europe\u2019. What is interesting about this study is that it makes comparisons among regions in the same countries, one less and one more advantaged region. I am certain that we could project most of the conclusions to other EU Member States. ",
        "2 It will become evident to the reader that economic decline, social instability and limited levels of education are significant factors in explaining the increased support for populists throughout the EU. However, there are other interdependent and more important factors, such as the desire to preserve the status quo, to protect traditional values, monocultures or particular identities. What is commonly referred to as \u2018identity politics\u2019. Opposing \u2018us\u2019 against the elites and \u2018others\u2019. Picking the right \u2018enemies\u2019 of course is key! In parallel, real or perceived insecurities are fuelled daily by disinformation, whilst many young voters are attracted to the idea that populist parties can bring positive change to stagnant and incompetent political systems. Unfortunately, once present, populism evolves and feeds on multiple forms of voter discontent. Personally I believe that there is one common reason which unities citizens who are attracted to populism. Namely: the fury of not been listened to and of not being heard by national and/or European institutions. The feeling that governments and \u2018Europe\u2019 care only for minority groups and not for them, the average European. The sense that there is no shared European identity which expresses them. I believe that the only way to strike out against populism is through our same democratic system that populists are trying to undermine. Listening and engaging in dialogue, rather than speaking at citizens. Ensuring that national and European policies are more responsive to proposals by citizens and civil society. Putting our energy towards communicating and explaining the EU\u2019s achievements and the positive impact on citizens\u2019 daily life. Trying to convince localities and regions to develop a common European purpose and explaining that diversity is welcome. In all of this frenzy of activities, civil society must play a key role against the proliferation of populism. However, this will necessitate national and EU assistance to enhance their current capacity to act. We as Members of the EESC have a double responsibility. To step up our activities at both the national and European levels, to strengthen networks, to better explain and to bring \u2018Europe\u2019 to its citizens. Ultimately, protecting and preserving liberal democracy is everyone\u2019s business! Arno Metzler President of the Diversity Europe Group ",
        "3 Abstract The Study identifies the factors influencing citizens\u2019 choices in favour of populism and the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) in countering it in eight non- metropolitan areas with high populist vote, one above and one below the EU average per country: Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (Austria), Dr\u00f4me and Aisne (France), Udine and Reggio di Calabria (Italy), P\u0142ocki and Nowos\u0105decki (Poland). Extensive desk research, two statistical analyses, 616 opinions of citizens from the regions, three focus groups and 54 in-depth interviews with CSOs and experts have informed the study\u2019s findings. Socioeconomic and cultural factors of populism vary across different social groups, between countries and between different regions within a country. No factor alone causes populism - there is an interplay of factors, which feed on and reinforce each other. The crises of representative democracy, diminished trust in traditional parties and online disinformation are strong additional factors. CSOs do not recognise populism as a distinctive type of challenge. There is a lack of encompassing and comprehensive civic initiatives in tackling populism due to the complexity of the phenomenon, the shrinking civic space in terms of lack of an enabling environment for CSOs operation, limited human resources, reduced funding and a lack of expertise.

        "4 1. Introduction There is already evidence of a \u201cpopulist wave\u201d in Europe and the rest of the world and its impact on politics, society, the economy and even the international order. The upcoming 2019 European Parliament elections are expected to be a massive test for European societies and the EU as a whole with populist parties vying for control of the institutions and showcasing their power. The word \u2018populism\u2019 was revealed as the 2017 Word of the Year by Cambridge University Press. The announcement said that \u201cwhat sets populism apart from all these other words is that it represents a phenomenon that\u2019s both truly local and truly global, as populations and their leaders across the world wrestle with issues of immigration and trade, resurgent nationalism, and economic discontent.\u201d Populism is indeed a global phenomenon with a global impact, but there is a need to assess its local and regional roots and impact. This report presents the findings of a study on populism in selected areas in Europe. Its motivation was twofold: to provide a better understanding of the factors influencing citizens\u2019 choices in favour of populism in non-metropolitan areas and insight into how civil society organisations (CSOs) operate to counter populism in view of recommending further civic actions. Reflecting this goal, eight non-metropolitan areas in four EU Member States \u2013 Austria, France, Italy and Poland \u2013 were selected to carry out the research, based on income and social and economic development and high populist vote at the most recent presidential and/or legislative elections (please, see Appendix 21: Populist vote results on national and regional level ). Each area selected is either around, or slightly higher than, the EU average or lower than EU average in order to account for different socioeconomic factors on the continent. The dual goal of the study has been operationalised through two sets of research questions. The first set of questions pertain to the reasons behind the populist vote and, more concretely, the determinants of populism in non-metropolitan areas. That is, the factors that affect populist voting (socioeconomic, social, political, discursive, e.g. political rhetoric and online disinformation), the extent to which these factors are present in non-metropolitan regions in the focal countries and whether they explain populist voting. The second set of questions address the situation of CSOs in the regions with regard to the populist challenge and their role regarding populism in non-metropolitan areas by asking if CSOs have specific programmes or actions targeted at tackling populism in the focal regions, identifying the strategies CSOs employ to combat populism and, ultimately, exploring the ways in which CSOs can increase the effectiveness of their strategies to tackle populism. The responsibility of mainstream parties and the role of political rhetoric, Euroscepticism, online disinformation and calls for more direct democracy were given special attention as elements of the populist challenge. ",
        "5 This report is organised into nine chapters. The first chapter contains an overview of the methodology , with more technical details laid out in the appendices of the other chapters. The second chapter introduces the non-metropolitan areas and the populist parties . The third chapter makes an overview of factors for populism at national and regional level in the countries in focus . Chapter four to seven are case studies of Austria, France, Italy and Poland on the current situation of populism and role of CSOs in countering populism in the eight regions . The eighth chapter contains a comparison across the eight regions in focus. The ninth chapter makes conclusions and proposes recommendations on how CSOs could improve their actions in preventing and opposing the populist challenge . 2. Methodology overview The point of departure of this study is the definition of the influential scholar of populism Cas Mudde, in which populism is defined as \u201ca thin-centred ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \u2018the pure people\u2019 and \u2018the corrupt elite\u2019, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (general will) of the people\u201d 1 . The study also draws on the study of Inglehart and Norris 2 on cultural factors and the rise of populism, among others, as referred to further in this report. Generally, radical right populism has been related to three defining features \u2013 anti- establishment, authoritarianism, and nativism 3 , but researches point out that populism can be found on both left and right as it can be combined with other ideologies \u2013 usually some form of socialism on the left and some kind of nationalism on the right. It is important to note that populism is not necessarily considered anti-democratic; it just redefines democracy as anti-liberal, denying pluralism and minority rights. 4 1 Mudde, C., \u2018The Populist Zeitgeist\u2019, Government and Opposition, Vol.39, Issue 4, Autumn 2004. 2 Inglehart, R.F. & Norris, P. \u2018Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash\u2019, HKS Faculty Research Working Paper Series, RWP16-026, August 2016. 3 Mudde, C., \u2018Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe\u2019, Cambridge University Press, 2007. 4 Mudde, C, \u2018Populism in Europe : a primer\u2019, Open Democracy, 12 May 2015, https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/cas- mudde/populism-in-europe-primer ",
        "6 In the European context, Euroscepticism is often the focal point of expressions of resentment by populists. They frame Euroscepticism in terms of socioeconomics (e.g. fiscal sovereignty, national debt, the euro), culture (e.g. immigration, multiculturalism), sovereignty (e.g. transfer of decision-making, centralisation) and legitimacy (e.g. democratic deficit, effectiveness, corruption), accusing the EU \u201cfor the harmful socioeconomic consequences of austerity; the threat to national sovereignty, security, or cultural homogeneity posed by non-EU migrants ; the upholding of a distant and undemocratic system of governance; or a combination of the above.\u201d 5 As Mudde succinctly points out, while Euroscepticism and populism are not the same thing, \u2018almost every populist is Eurosceptic, not every Eurosceptic is a populist\u201d 6 . The study has adopted a list of populist parties in the countries in focus, as identified in the scholarly literature on populism 7 . These are the Freiheitliche Partei \u00d6sterreichs (FP\u00d6) for Austria, the Rassemblement national (RN; previously National Front) and La France Insoumise (LFI) for France, Forza Italia (FI), Lega Nord (LN) and Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) for Italy 8 , and Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 (PiS), Kukiz \u201915 and KORWiN 9 for Poland.

        "7 A number of approaches were employed to find answers to the main research questions and elicit insights and recommendations in order to provide a better understanding of the factors influencing citizens\u2019 choices in favour of populism in non-metropolitan areas and of how CSOs operate to counter populism. The sources of information were existing studies of populism and related phenomena, social and economic data (mainly from national statistics and Eurostat), public opinion polls (national, international and Eurobarometer), election results and analysis (national and international sources) and CSO databases (national sources), collected through intensive desk research. The project team also prepared and conducted citizen surveys and focus groups in the regions, interviews and panels based on specially designed questionnaires to gather further information to answer the research questions (see the appendices for further details ) 10 . A statistical analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and populist voting patterns, based on existing social and economic data and election information. Two analyses were conducted: the first made use of the voting patterns observed in the eight regions themselves, using indicators at NUTS 3 level 11 where possible and NUTS 2 level when the former were not available; the second looked at national level indicators and their relationship to overall national voting patterns. 10 The interviews, carried out for the purposes of the study, included CSOs activists and experts from the countries in focus or EU-based experts and officials. There is an appendix with a list of the names and affiliation of those, who agreed to reveal publicly this information. The interviews in the text are quoted similar to the Chatham House Rule, where the study is free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the interviewed was referred to directly to the quotes. Instead, the interviewees are into several broad groups when referred to in the text: CSO (representative) from the region, national/international CSO representative, national CSO expert in populism, academic expert in populism, European expert in public affairs/populism or regional official. 11 For more details and information, please see the next parts of this study on \u201cIdentifying the eight regions\u201d, \u201cFactors for populism at national and regional level: exploring socio- economic, political-cultural and demographic indicators\u201d and the respective appendixes. ",
        "8 Exploratory citizen surveys focused on citizens in the eight regions in the four countries identified in the study 12 . An estimate of 36 closed questions aimed at understanding the political, cultural and social concerns of people resident in the respective regions and the issues that inform voters\u2019 choices, e.g. with a focus on populist parties, choices and likely factors for these choices. The survey also included a number of questions relating to demographic information and voting preferences in order to help understand the phenomena at hand. The survey was internet-based and aimed for at least 50 completed respondents from each of the eight regions (please, see the national chapters and the respective appendices for more details ) to provide insight into the research questions and to serve as a basis for further exploration through focus groups and interviews. Overall 616 responses were received from the eight regions. The analysis is based on select questions pertinent to the five dimensions of populism as identified in this study: ant-elite, majoritarian, authoritarian, monocultural and Eurosceptic with an additional focus on issues such as direct democracy and sovereignty. As a rule, while only the responses to main questions out of 36 are provided in the text, all answers were taken into account and when deemed necessary (e.g. differences between the regions), additional questions and the responses to them were included in the analysis too. A CSO mapping, based on publicly available information was carried out to gather basic information about CSOs working in the regions, their main fields of operation and, especially, their actions to counter populism. The focus groups aimed at eliciting in-depth information and opinion from stakeholders, including CSO activists, from several of the regions in the study. They were carried out in three regions \u2013 Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd regions of Austria and Dr\u00f4me in France. The focus groups gathered 6-12 stakeholders from the respective regions to elicit their opinions on a number of research-related issues. The questionnaire for the focus groups was divided into several parts, exploring the situation with populism and populist parties in the regions, the underlying factors for their rise or failure (depending on the case), the situation with CSOs and what could be done to remedy the negative effects. 12 The citizens survey used a Facebook campaign to target residents of each of the eight regions. In the Austrian and the French regions (especially in Aisne), local CSOs raised awareness on the survey as well. The survey employed a specialized online survey tool for the structured, closed- ended questionnaire with 36 questions related to populism and questions related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. ",
        "9 More than 50 expert and CSO interviews were carried out in the four countries in question, including European level experts and CSO activists in the field. The in-depth interview further illuminated the populism phenomena from diverse national and European perspectives, identified commonalities and differences, and set out recommendations that encompass the various aspects of the complex populist challenge. The questionnaires for CSOs and political science experts were open-ended and followed a similar blueprint for both groups of respondents, but were also designed to identify the regional and national specifics as well as the diverse perspectives of both political science experts and CSO activists (please, see Appendix 4 on the questionnaire and Appendix 7 for a list of interviewed experts and CSO activists ). The information from the various sources (existing and own surveys) was the analysed to produce this report, along with a set of recommendations. 3. Introducing the non-metropolitan areas and the populist parties 3.1. Identifying the eight regions The study was carried out in eight non- metropolitan areas in four EU Member States \u2013 Austria, Italy, Poland and France. For each country, the study focused on two non-metropolitan areas presenting a level of income, economic and social development that is a) on or slightly higher than the EU average and b) below the EU average. The geographical and socioeconomic scope was also taken into account in the evaluation. Moreover, the following regions were selected because of their high level of the populist vote at the latest presidential and/or legislative elections (please, see Appendix 21: Populist vote results on national and regional level ): Klagenfurt- Villach (KV) and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (NO-S) in Austria, Dr\u00f4me (DR) and Aisne (AI) in France, Udine (UD) and Reggio di Calabria (RC) in Italy and P\u0142ocki (PL) and Nowos\u0105decki (NW) in Poland. The table below ( Table 1 ) shows that the main economic and demographic data for the selected regions is GDP per capita compared to the EU28 average, GDP per inhabitant, the total population with population density and the largest urban area. There are considerable variations within countries as well as between countries, e.g. a GDP compared to the EU28 average ranging from 43% in Nowos\u0105decki, Poland, to 127% in Klagenfurt-Villach, Austria.

        "13 3.2. Identifying the populist parties and the rise of populism in the countries in focus This study adopted the definitions of prominent scholars of populism Mudde, Inglehart and Norris. Cas Mudde defines populism as \u201can ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \u2018the pure people\u2019 versus \u2018the corrupt elite\u2019, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (general will) of the people.\u201d 14 Drawing on Mudde\u2019s \u2018influential\u2019 definition, Inglehart and Norris 15 frame populism as a loose set of ideas with three core features: They derive four aspects of populism from this definition. First, faith in the wisdom and virtue of ordinary people, or silent majority, is emphasised over the corrupt establishment. There is a dichotomy between a homogeneous and \u2018good\u2019 people and a corrupt and dishonest elite. Second, populists are often characterised by authoritarianism, favouring a strong and charismatic leadership that reflects the will of the people. Third, populists prefer majoritarian over representative democracy, with a distaste for the institutional checks and balances and protection of minority rights indicative of the latter. Finally, populists prefer mono-culturalism over multiculturalism, national interest over international cooperation, closed borders over the free flow of people, ideas, labour and capital, and traditionalism over liberal social values. In addition, the study adopted an additional facet of populism in Europe \u2013 Euroscepticism \u2013 as specified by the assignment. 16 As Mudde succinctly points out, while Euroscepticism and populism are not the same thing, \u201calmost every populist is Eurosceptic, not every Eurosceptic is a populist\u201d 17 . 14 Mudde, 2004. 15 Inglehart, R. F. & Norris, P., 2016. 16 For more information, please see Pirro & Van Kessel, 2018. 17 Mudde, 2017. ",
        "14 The populist parties in the countries concerned in the study were selected and categorised according to data from the Chapel Hill Political science expert Survey (CHES), which estimates party positioning on European integration, ideology and policy issues for national parties in a variety of European countries. 18 For the purpose of this study, an index was constructed to measure positions and attitudes of identified populist parties along the lines of anti-elitism, majoritarianism, authoritarianism, monoculturalism and Euroscepticism (see Table 2 below and Appendix 22 ). It is important to note that only parties that received 4% of the popular vote or more in the most recent election are included (see Appendix 21 for more information ). Table 2.

However, using \u2018The Manifesto Project\u2019, it is clear that FP\u00d6 are in favour of direct democracy over representative democracy. A content analysis of their 2013 manifesto shows that the only mentions of democracy referred to direct democracy.

        "15 4. Factors for populism at national and regional level: exploring socioeconomic, political-cultural and demographic indicators One of the major goals of the study was to examine the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and populist voting patterns. In this case, major socioeconomic indicators and related political-cultural (attitudinal) and demographic indicators were analysed using a statistical model (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 ). A broader set of possible indicators were included to help examine the factors and root causes behind the rise of populism and suggest further courses of action. The information in this chapter is based on available data from Eurostat, Eurobarometer and national level data sources 22 (see Appendix 2: Socioeconomic and political-cultural variables ). The information gathered through the citizen and CSO surveys and political science expert interviews in the course of the study is provided as part of each of the four national chapters on Austria, France, Italy and Poland. 22 With regard to election results and socio-demographic profiles of voters the sources are as follows: For Austria: http://www.sora.at/themen/wahlverhalten/wahlanalysen.html For France data on the legislative election can be found here: https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/files-fr- fr/doc_associe/ipsos_sopra_steria_sociologie_des_electorats_11_juin_21h00.pdf and data on the presidential election can be found here: https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/files-fr-fr/doc_associe/ipsos-sopra-steria_sociologie-des-electorats_23-avril- 2017-21h.pdf For Italy: https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-03/elezioni_politiche_2018_-_analisi_post- voto_ipsos-twig.pdf For Poland: - data on gender: https://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/wybory-parlamentarne-2015-kobiety-wolaly-pis,589082.html; - data on age and education: http://www.newsweek.pl/polska/szczegolowe-wyniki-wyborow-parlamentarnych-2015-jak- glosowaly-wojewodztwa,artykuly,372966,1.html; - data on employment: https://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/wybory-parlamentarne-2015-wyniki-glosowania-grup- zawodowych,589085.html 23 The study used the values of each indicator from the year of each election; where data is available quarterly, the study used the value for the last quarter of the year. Where data was not available for a given year, the study used the chronologically closest datum; in these cases, the data was not collected more than two years before/after the election reported. As the study was focused on non- metropolitan areas, the analysis of statistical data was carried out at two levels \u2013 national and regional \u2013 providing valuable insights through comparisons between the different levels. 23 The analysis was conducted at the level of the eight regions in the four focal countries \u2013 NUTS 3 where possible and NUTS 2 when not available. The national level analysis included socioeconomic, demographic and attitudinal (public opinion) indicators and their relationship to the overall national voting patterns in regard to populist parties. ",
        "16 4.1. Overview of factors for populism at national and regional level in the countries in focus The macroeconomic situation, national public opinion, regional level developments and the populist vote at national level provide the necessary context for the drivers of the populist vote and further analysis. In Austria , macroeconomic indicators and socioeconomic conditions seem highly promising. Gross disposable income has been consistently high, around 5,000 EUR above the EU average. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has been at least 7% lower than the mean of the EU-28, and has been falling relatively steadily, although it did increase between 2012 and 2013, and again between 2016 and 2017. Furthermore, employment has also been both high and stable, steadily increasing since 2014, and passing 75% in 2017, relative to an EU average of 72.2%. National growth was, of course, hit by the financial crisis. Austria appeared to bounce back rather well from the first dip, showing growth of over 2.5% in 2011, but was slower to recover than the EU average during the second dip. However, this recovery was still faster than that of Italy and was largely in line with trends observed in France. Social benefit expenditure is somewhat below the EU average, but with high levels of wealth and low levels of income inequality, this seems unlikely to have a negative impact. National opinion in Austria shows that, among the countries studied, Austrian citizens gave the highest ratings of their household financial situation, the national economy, satisfaction with national democracy and trust in the national parliament, averaged across the period 2008-2018. From 2014 to 2016, citizens began to distrust the national parliament and national government, but some trust was recovered in a sharp upturn in 2017. Despite a tendency to distrust national institutions, Austrians still reported overall satisfaction with the way democracy works in their country. Ratings of the national economy fell in 2009 and 2014 but have shown a fast recovery in both cases. In 2017, these ratings were the highest observed in the ten-year period. Austria is the only country studied whose national economy was rated more positively than negatively at any point between 2008 and 2018. Similarly, ratings of household financial situation were much more positive in Austria than in the other three countries; they have, overall, been increasing and seemed to be barely hit by downturns in growth, possibly reflecting the consistent increases in gross disposable income at national level. ",
        "17 Regional level developments in Austria show that the growth of regional GVA was faster in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, which has a lower GDP than Klagenfurt-Villach, until the two growth rates converged in 2016. However, average disposable income, employment rate and social benefit expenditure are all higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, which suggests that, whilst there is more value produced in Klagenfurt-Villach, the standard of living is higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. Populist voting in Austria shows that all the indicators implicated in the populist vote are stronger in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd and it is perhaps not surprising that populist parties here receive a lower vote share than those in Klagenfurt-Villach. However, the differences in voting behaviour have been small since 2010 and, indeed, in 2016 and 2017 the two regions were practically indistinguishable by this measure. Figure 2. Comparison of key socio-economic indicators across the four focal countries (2008-2018) ",
        "18 Austria appears to be, overall, the most socioeconomically successful of the countries studied, and shows the second lowest level of populist voting. There is a continued presence of a populist movement, with the FP\u00d6 consistently receiving 20-30% of the total vote share, despite citizens remaining positive about the economic situation and national institutions. At a macroeconomic level, France seems to have been comparatively stable in the years since 2008. Growth fell between 2008 and 2009, but, of the four countries studied, the contraction was least pronounced there, with growth reaching a low point of -2.5, nearly 1.5 points stronger than the EU average. Similarly, the second dip seemed to have less of an immediate effect on France than the rest of the EU, although economic recovery was somewhat slower. Income inequality has been turbulent but has been consistently at or below the EU average; the Gini index in 2015 (.295) was approximately equal to that of 2008 (.293), suggesting little progress in improving income equality. Employment rates have been moderate and stable at around 70% for the entire period studied and, in 2017, increased to above 2008 levels for the first time. Gross disposable income remains well above the EU average and social benefit expenditure is high, at around four times greater than the EU average . National opinion in France, despite the relatively positive macroeconomic picture, shows that French citizens appear dissatisfied with the national economy and have consistently rated it poorly. These ratings, however, have been increasing consistently, and relatively rapidly, since 2014. Satisfaction with the way that democracy works, as well as trust in national government and parliament have all followed the same pattern: rising slowly between 2009 and 2012, falling dramatically between 2012 and 2014 and rising again by 2017. At present, citizens lean slightly towards distrusting national institutions. In contrast, ratings of household financial situation have remained relatively stable and positive, although have failed to show the increases observed in the other three countries in recent years. Regional level developments in France show that Dr\u00f4me performs consistently better than Aisne in macroeconomic indicators: it has a substantially higher GDP, employment rate, and average disposable income. The two regions have relatively similar rates of growth and have shown recovery in all the aforementioned indicators at approximately the same rate in recent years. This suggests that, whilst Aisne may not be said to have been \u201cleft behind\u201d, there is no sign of convergence between the two regions, suggesting that regional inequality is persistent. The greatest disparity between the two regions lies in the fact that social benefit expenditure in Dr\u00f4me is almost four times that in Aisne. ",
        "19 Populist voting in France shows that the national vote share for populist parties is lower in France than in any of the other three countries considered; this may be reflective of its relatively healthy economic status, although it is clear that recent economic crises have taken their toll on public opinion. However, local socioeconomic conditions may play a role. Populist parties in Aisne, the less socioeconomically successful of the two regions, consistently receive a vote share around five percentage points higher than those in Dr\u00f4me. In Italy , macroeconomic indicators paint a bleak socioeconomic picture. Between 2008 and 2009, Italy\u2019s GDP volume contracted significantly more than the EU average and the other countries in this study, with growth falling to -5.5%, relative to an EU average of -4.3%; initial recovery matched that of the rest of the EU, but Italy was dramatically affected by the second dip in 2012, with growth of -2.8% relative to an EU average of -.4%. National employment rates have been low for the entire period considered but have followed the general trends within the EU-28, falling until 2013 then beginning to show recovery. However, once again Italy seemed to be affected by a second dip, with a notable drop in employment between 2012 and 2013, which is not observed in the other countries. Furthermore, income inequality, as expressed by the Gini index, has been increasing dramatically since 2009 and this trend shows no sign of slowing down. Italy is the only country of the four that has a significantly higher Gini index than the EU- 28 average. Somewhat more positively, gross disposable income is approximately equal to that of the EU average, and social benefit expenditure is much higher. National opinion in Italy has been rather negative for the duration of the period examined. Ratings of the national economy and trust in national institutions have been consistently below zero. Of all four populations, Italian citizens give the lowest average rating of the national economy, household financial situation and trust in both national government and national parliament. Citizens appear to have been more satisfied with both the national economy and their personal situation in 2009 than in 2008, but after 2009 they became increasingly dissatisfied until 2013. Whilst opinions are becoming more positive in all these domains, only the rating of household financial situation has fully recovered to surpass that observed in 2009. Regional level developments in Italy show that there are significant disparities in the socioeconomic situations of the two regions, Udine and Reggio di Calabria. In particular, there is a large disparity in disposable income, with the average disposable income of households in Reggio di Calabria the lowest of all the regions we have studied. Disposable income has increased steadily since 2013, and this change is occurring in parallel in both regions, meaning that there is no sign of convergence. Employment rates mirror this pattern: employment in both regions has been steadily increasing since 2013, but there is a difference of over 20 points between them, with Reggio di Calabria showing the lowest employment rate of the eight regions by a wide margin. ",
        "20 Figure 3. Regional level comparison of key socio-economic indicators across the eight regions in focus (2008-2018) Udine, which has a significantly higher GDP than Reggio di Calabria, has shown some small growth every year since 2013, whilst the GDP of Reggio di Calabria continued to contract until 2018. This disparity was greatest in 2017, with Udine showing a growth rate of .4, compared to -2.7 in Reggio di Calabria. However, when averaged across the ten years studied, Udine had the second lowest level of growth of the eight regions studied, so it is evident that both regions performed poorly. Populist voting in Italy saw the largest average vote share for populist parties across the ten years studied, and this may be partially explained by the socioeconomic backdrop of massive inequality and incredibly low employment rates. It is notable, however, that despite large disparities in average disposable income and growth rates, the size of the populist vote is remarkably similar across the two regions, suggesting that populism is, here, more or less a national-level phenomenon, pertaining to the entire country and the regional socioeconomic differences have little impact. These questions are further explored by other methods within this study with the results of citizen surveys and CSO and political science expert interviews presented elsewhere in the report. ",
        "21 In Poland , macroeconomic indicators show that the country\u2019s economy is characterised by its rapid growth and the continued improvement of indicators of quality of life. Growth was hit in 2009 but did not fall below 2.5%. Whilst the second dip caused a more dramatic decline in 2012 and 2013, the Polish economy did not at any point begin to contract. Growth rates have remained much higher than the EU average, reaching a low point of 1.4% in 2013, relative to a mean rate of 0.3% across the EU-28. This continued growth is reflected in consistent increases in gross disposable income, with people, on average, being almost 5,000 EUR better off in 2016 than 2008. Disposable income has, however, remained well below the EU average, although convergence towards the rest of the EU-28 is clear: in 2008, EU gross disposable income was 8,633 EUR higher than that of Poland, whilst in 2016 this difference had fallen to 6,494 EUR. Similarly, income inequality has been continually decreasing across the entire ten-year period, falling from a high of .308 to a low of .292 on the Gini index, relative to an EU average of .310 and .308 respectively. Growth in employment was arguably slightly delayed in comparison to the increases in disposable income. Employment rates were consistently around 5 percentage points lower than the EU average between 2008 and 2013, at which point they began to rise rather quickly, from a low of 64.3% in 2010 to 70.9% in 2017, relative to an EU average of 68.6% and 72.2% respectively. Social benefit expenditure is a little below the mean of the EU-28 and has been fairly stable across the period in question. National opinion in Poland indicates that there was a high level of distrust in national government and parliament in 2009, but this appeared to dissipate in 2010, when citizens still tended to distrust the institutions, but at a similar level to the populations of Italy and France. This level of trust has been stable since 2010, although there was a decrease in trust in the national government specifically between 2014 and 2015. Despite these low levels of trust, Polish citizens tend to respond positively when asked about their satisfaction with the way that democracy works in their country. Public opinion of the national economy is somewhat negative but is significantly more positive than that observed in Italy and France and appears to be steadily increasing. Ratings of household financial situation fell dramatically between 2009 and 2010, but have been slowly recovering since 2011, and are now higher than those seen in both Italy and France. However, these ratings have still not surpassed 2009 levels, despite the dramatic increases seen in disposable income and employment rates. ",
        "22 Regional level developments in Poland show that P\u0142ocki has a GDP over 10,000 EUR higher than that of Nowos\u0105decki and an average disposable income that is 3,100 EUR greater (2015). Disposable income in Nowos\u0105decki is the lowest of all eight regions studied. Disposable income and employment rates have been increasing at an approximately equivalent rate in both regions and, as such, there is no sign that this regional inequality is shrinking. Growth in GVA is somewhat higher in Nowos\u0105decki, but this difference is slowly decreasing. Social benefit expenditure in P\u0142ocki is near to the average of the regions studied, whilst Nowos\u0105decki spends very little, with only Klagenfurt-Villach spending less. Populist voting in Poland shows that Nowos\u0105decki, the region with the lowest levels of disposable income and second lowest employment rate, is the region in which the average populist vote share is the highest. The picture in P\u0142ocki, similarly, is one in which disposable income is low, but employment and social benefits are at similar levels to those observed in other regions. The populist vote share here is higher than that in any French or Austrian region, but lower than that in both Italian regions. It seems reasonable to think that socioeconomic difficulties could be implicated in the attraction of populist parties here. However, it is important to bear in mind that the swift growth and improvements in income levels seen in Poland have not been mirrored by a decrease in the popularity of populist parties. This implies either that something else must also be in play, or that it is hard to push populism out of the national discourse once it has entered. This is explored further in this study (see the results of political science expert interviews and CSO surveys in this report ). ",
        "23 4.2. Socio-economic and political-cultural indicators and the populist vote: main findings of the analysis at national level in the four countries in focus This section of the study presents the results of the analysis of a specially designed statistical model 24 , based on publicly available information. This analysis was made at both national and regional level and is described in two different sections below. The use of a single statistical model allowed us to explore the role of socioeconomic factors of populism in all countries in consideration. Aggregating the data, respectively, at national and regional level ensured a larger data set that provided a better normal distribution and higher confidence level, increasing the validity of the results. In addition to this method, the study employed other methods of research as planned \u2013 the citizen surveys, interviews with political science experts and CSO activists and focus groups \u2013 to deepen the understanding of the complex and multifaceted phenomena at hand. The latter research methods were better suited to implementation at regional level. Using a variety of methods \u2013 quantitative and qualitative \u2013 allowed for a fuller/richer picture and a better pursuit of the goals of the study. The use of national level data allowed the team to examine the role of socioeconomic and political-cultural indicators that were not available at regional level. These indicators included inequality, measured by the Gini index, employment levels, economic growth, gross disposable income, social benefits, the number of asylum decisions, satisfaction with democracy, trust in government and parliament, perception of one\u2019s own financial situation and related issues. The inclusion of public attitudes provided important insights as previous studies on populism have indicated the role of political- cultural factors 25 . The raw data for the socioeconomic and attitudinal indicators at national level are represented in Table 3 and the sources are listed in Appendix 2 . 24 The statistical model is explained in more detail in the Appendix 1: Statistical model. The statistical model was used for exploring the relationship between socioeconomic, political-cultural (attitudinal) and demographic indicators and the populist vote. All variables are standardised z- scores, reflecting the number of standard deviations of change in the dependent variable for every standard deviation of change in the independent variable(s). All R 2 given are adjusted. The model used stepwise regression of: populist vote on regional level data, of right-wing populist vote on regional level data, of populist vote in national level data, populist vote on national level data, including Eurobarometer data. The variables (indicators) are populist vote, disposable income, employment rate, social benefits expenditure, GDP, growth, Gini Index (for economic inequality), positive asylum decisions, employment, growth, gross disposable income, average rating of the situation of the national economy, optimism, trust in democracy average satisfaction with the way democracy works in country, average rating of household financial situation, all other Eurobarometer questions included in the appendix with data and sources. 25 See, for example, Inglehart & Norris. \"Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash.\" HKS Faculty Research Working Paper Series RWP16-026, August 2016.

        "25 \u2018Standardised magnitude\u2019 is a measure of the size of a relationship with \u20131 a perfect downhill (negative) linear relationship and +1 a perfect uphill (positive) linear relationship. \u2018p\u2019 is the probability that the results would be observed if there was no relationship between the variable and a populist vote; p < 0.001 is statistically highly significant as (less than one in a thousand chance of being wrong). \u2018R 2 \u2019 is the potential of total variation that can be explained by a variable; the higher value in the column, the better explanation by the variable. The Gini index, which measures economic inequality, showed a striking positive relationship with the populist vote among all additional indicators. This suggests that greater levels of income inequality (post taxes and transfers) are closely associated with a greater vote share for populist parties. The number of positive asylum decisions made was not associated with the populist vote. There is also an insignificant relationship between disposable income and the populist vote at national level. But it should be noted that a stronger relationship with disposable income was registered at regional level (see analysis below). The difference between the results at national and regional level may be because, at the larger national scale, the measure of mean gross disposable income says little about the actual income of most citizens, since it will be strongly influenced by the income of the very rich and collapses across regional disparities, in particular between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. The addition of Eurobarometer data on public attitudes enabled an examination of the relationship between the perception of socioeconomic conditions and the populist vote. Greater satisfaction with national democracy, a stronger tendency to trust national parliament and national government, and a higher rating of household financial situation were all associated with a lower populist vote when considered individually. A poorer average rating of the situation of one\u2019s household financial situation was associated with greater populist voting and a lower average satisfaction with the way democracy works in one\u2019s own country showed the same relationship. In contrast, a more positive average perception of the situation of the national economy was associated with more success for populist parties. It is plausible that this latter finding may be explained by a perception of national wealth that \u2018the people\u2019 are not benefiting from and the resulting frustration, but this necessitated further exploration by employing other research methods (see the CSO surveys and political science expert interviews further in this report ). ",
        "26 In general, the values of socioeconomic indicators did not change substantially over time, suggesting that they best explained the variation between regions or countries. It might be posited, then, that the socioeconomic situation of a region influences the extent to which populist parties may find success in that region, but that the development of populism over time is more likely to be influenced by political factors, such as the way in which campaigns are fought or how disinformation is spread, which is explored further in this study. In the analysis, the Gini index continued to show the strongest relationship with the populist vote, thus it seems to explain, to a large extent, populist voting patterns \u2013 i.e. higher inequality is related to a higher populist vote and vice versa. As Figure 4 shows on the scatter graph, the higher the value of inequality (measured by the Gini Index), as shown on the horizontal axis, the higher the share of the populist vote, as shown on the vertical axis. Figure 4. The relationship between income inequality and populist vote share at national level ",
        "27 4.3. Socioeconomic factors of populism at regional level The same statistical model of analysis was applied at regional level with the data for all regions aggregated in a similar way to the national level analysis explained above. A different set of indicators was used at regional level compared to the national level due to data availability at the different levels as the data was compiled from public sources only (as shown in Appendix 2 ). At regional level, the indicators included in the study were social benefits, GDP per inhabitant, regional economic growth, employment level and disposable income (find more information about the variables and sources in Appendix 2 ). The raw data is showed in Table 5 and the results of the statistical analysis are shown in Table 6 . Table 5.

The results suggest that higher levels of disposable income, employment rate, social benefit expenditure and GDP were all associated with a smaller populist vote share at regional level, with Table 6 displaying the statistical results. It seems that the economic wellbeing of a region is an important factor influencing populism amongst its citizens. ",

        "29 Importantly, when all the indicators are combined into a single model, disposable income is the only indicator that reaches significance, suggesting the relationship depicted by the scatter graph in Figure 5 \u2013 i.e. a decrease in disposable income as shown on the horizontal axis is associated with an increase in support for populist parties as shown on the vertical axis. Figure 5. The relationship between disposable income and populist vote share at a regional level At regional level, employment rate, social benefit expenditure and GDP have little influence on the likelihood of voting for a populist party directly. Rather, they likely have an indirect influence as together they are associated with a variation in disposable income. For example, it is the relative household wealth that is most closely associated with a reduction in the populist vote. Disposable income appears to explain 28% of the total variation in populist vote. The strength of this relationship can be seen in Figure 5 . If right wing populism alone is considered (i.e. excluding votes for La France Insoumise and Movimento 5 Stelle), then disposable income and social benefits show an even stronger association with the populist vote. When controlling for disposable income and social benefits, a positive relationship between employment and the populist vote emerges. This means that, in two theoretical regions with identical levels of average disposable income and social benefit expenditure, a higher populist vote would likely be observed in the region with the higher employment rate. This suggests that the working poor may be more likely to vote for populist parties than those who are unemployed. ",
        "30 5. The case of Austria: populism, citizens and CSOs 5.1. The rise of populism and populist parties in Austria In Austria, populism can be traced back to economic decline in the 1980s and the transition from full employment to labour market liberalisation 26 , which then developed under the charismatic leadership of Joerg Haider and, since 2005, Heinz-Christian Strache. Under Haider, the Freiheitliche Partei \u00d6sterreichs (FP\u00d6) addressed three basic concerns of voters: the growth of the immigrant population, which led to questions about national identity; the growing economic insecurity of the working class, which could no longer be mitigated by subsidies to industry and indefinite job protection; and, political corruption among the two main parties, Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) and the Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6VP), which created popular resentment against mainstream politicians 27 . Strache has continued these policies, campaigning since 2011 on putting \u201cAustria first\u201d 28 . Table 7. Populism Index of selected parties in Austria The populist party identified in Austria was the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6). FP\u00d6 scores highly in every category of populism we could measure, particularly monoculturalism. They are strongly in favour of assimilationist policies for migrants and restricted immigration, are committed to creating a true direct democracy in Austria and would prioritise the domestic workforce and expand social welfare services for citizens. Their Euroscepticism includes renationalising EU competences, restricting free movement and halving Austria\u2019s contribution to the EU budget. Their idea of Europe is to preserve its cultural identity (that is, stopping immigration from third countries to prevent the Islamification of Europe) and restoring the democratic rights of European peoples against the EU bureaucracy 29 . 26 Liu, L., \u201cThe Decline of Centrist Mass Parties and the Rise of Right-Wing Populism (RWP) in Europe: Case Studies of Neoliberal Reform and Immigration in the UK\u201d, Germany and Austria, 2015. 27 Ibid. 28 Party Programme of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), 2011. 29 FP\u00d6 \u2018Programm\u2019 http://www.FP\u00d6e.eu/dokumente/programm/ Countr y Part y Dimensions, scores on a scale 1 to 10, low to high Anti-elite Majoritaria n Authoritaria n Monocultura l Euroscepti c Austria FP\u00d6 8.2 8.92 8.88 9.76 8.46 The Populism Index was constructed for the purposes of this study. It scores the parties along five dimensions on a scale 1 to 10, lowest to highest. The data used was the available from the Chapel Hill Political science expert Survey (CHES). See also Appendix 22 . ",
        "31 The regional trends in the populist vote in the two regions of Austria - Klagenfurt- Villach (KV) and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (NS) in Austria, show that there was actually a decrease in the populist from 2008 to 2010, followed by an increase and then another drop in 2016 (please, see the trends and comparison across all eight regions in the Appendix 3: The populist vote at regional level: an overview of trends across regions and time ). 5.2. Demographic indicators and the populist vote in Austria at national level The study also carried out an analysis of a number of demographic indicators \u2013 gender, age, education and employment \u2013 to examine their relationship with populist voting patterns at national level. 30 In terms of gender, the results of the analysis generally showed that men are slightly more likely to vote for populist parties, but the differences are small. FP\u00d6 consistently receives a higher percentage of the male vote than the female vote; this can be observed in the elections of 2013, 2016 and 2017. Since this pattern is consistent across time, the figure shows the mean vote share received by FP\u00d6 for each gender, taken from all three aforementioned elections (an estimate of 37% male voters and about 25% female voters). The relationship between age and vote share for FP\u00d6 appears to differ from election to election and by the time of the 2017 legislative election, FP\u00d6 had lost a number of voters aged 60 or over and gained popularity with those under 30. 30 The study used national exit poll data, which provides an estimate as to the voting behaviour of particular demographic groups, to consider possible trends in voting patterns across these groups, both within individual countries and for particular parties. It allowed also for observations of any common features that hold across the countries studied. The analysis at national level is based on available public data and the analysis at regional level is based on the citizen surveys, conducted for the purposes of this study and provided in the national chapters.

        "32 5.3. Citizen surveys in the Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich- S\u00fcd regions of Austria The citizen surveys, as with the other countries, were focused on eliciting the opinion of citizens specifically in the two regions in focus in Austria \u2013 Klagenfurt- Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (abbreviated respectively as KV and NS). 31 . The sample representation, however, in terms of age, gender, education, occupation, income bracket, religious affiliation and political preferences provides a suitable basis for the purposes of the study as there are respondents within all main demographic categories listed above (e.g. 34% male and 66% female in Klagenfurt-Villach and 41% male and 59% female in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd). 31 The survey included 36 closed-ended questions and demographic information about the respondents for each of the two regions. It was carried out online on a voluntary basis. They are exploratory surveys meant to complement the other survey methods as the samples are small for a representative study. A representative study for each of the regions, based on their population size, would require some 380 people or more to respond, with a 5% margin of error. 32 In Klagenfurt-Villach, out of 68 respondents, who responded to the political affiliation question, 14.70% (10) marked SPO, 19.10% (13) FPO, 35.30% (24) OVP, 19.10% (13) non-voters, 4.40% (3) preferred not to answer, 7.40% (5) other parties. 33 In Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, out of 56 respondents, who responded to the political affiliation question, 16,10% (9) marked SPO, 21,40% (12) FPO, 14,30% (8) OVP, 16,10% (9) non-voters, 12,5% (7) preferred not to answer, 19,6% (11) other parties. A total of 68 respondents 32 from Klagenfurt- Villach and 56 respondents 33 from Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd took part in the survey. As noted in the beginning of this report, the two regions were selected for their different socioeconomic characteristics and the high level of populist vote in those regions (please, see also Appendix 22 ). The table below shows the main indicators. Klagenfurt-Villach, which is located in the south of the country, is the wealthier of the two regions with a GDP 127% of the EU28 average. Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, which is located in the north-east of Austria, is at 94% GDP of EU28 average, much lower than the national average for Austria of 130% GDP PPS. The population of Klagenfurt-Villach is more than twice that of Nieder\u00f6sterreich- S\u00fcd. ",

Moreover an analysis of the socio- demographic characteristics of the respondents is provided based on the respective questions in the citizen survey. With regard to age , 50% of the populist FP\u00d6 respondents in the Klagenfurt-Villach region are between 45-54 years old and in the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region 43% of FP\u00d6 voters are between 55-64 years old. The rest are younger, between 25-54 years old ( Appendix 11 : Figures 1 and 2 ). Concerning gender , 60% of FP\u00d6 voters in the Klagenfurt-Villach region are female, while in the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, 64% are male ( Appendix 11 : Figures 2 and 4 ). In terms of education , 40% of FP\u00d6 voters in the Klagenfurt-Villach region have no qualifications and, in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, 21% do not have qualification, giving FP\u00d6 voters the lowest education level of all the groups ( Appendix 11 : Figure 3 and 6 ). With regard to employment , 35% of FP\u00d6 voters in the Klagenfurt-Villach region are employed full-time and 20% unemployed, and in the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, 64% of FP\u00d6 voters are employed full-time, which is the highest for the region. ( Appendix 11 : Figures 4 and 8 ). Concerning annual household income , FP\u00d6 voters are almost equally divided between the smallest income group (up to EUR 24,999) and the next income bracket (EUR 25,000 to 49,999) and, in the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, 50% of FP\u00d6 voters are in the middle group (EUR 25,000-49,999) ( Appendix 11 : Figures 5 and 10 ). 34 The questionnaire for the citizen survey often included two or more questions to explore each topic, totalling 36 questions on different aspects of populism. This report shows only selected key questions out of these 36 and the respective responses, which were deemed most relevant for the analysis. ",
        "34 With regard to religion , 70% of FP\u00d6 voters in the Klagenfurt-Villach region belong to Catholicism, which is higher than the regional average and, in the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, 36% of FP\u00d6 voters are Catholic and 50% are not religious, which is comparable to the regional averages ( Appendix 11 : Figures 6 and 12 ). On the issue of anti-elitism and whether politicians are from a different socioeconomic class to other citizens, there are two main conclusions. First, respondents in both regions have very similar opinions. Second, while there are no overwhelming majorities, there are more respondents who agree with the proposition that politicians are from a different socioeconomic class \u2013 43% in Klagenfurt- Villach and 42% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd \u2013 than who disagree with it \u2013 32% in Klagenfurt-Villach and 30% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. There are very similar levels of undecided respondents \u2013 25% in Klagenfurt-Villach and 27% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. In the Klagenfurt- Villach region, the populist FP\u00d6 actually has a smaller share of those who agree with this populist proposition (54%), compared to the opposition SP\u00d6 (70%), which is the highest share among all groups. It is a similar situation in the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, as the opposition SP\u00d6 has a higher share (56%) of those who agree (those who gave no political affiliation have 57%), compared to just 33% among the populist and governing FP\u00d6 party ( Appendix 10 : Figures 1 and 2 ). In terms of direct democracy and, specifically, using more direct referenda, there is very high support for this suggestion and it is almost identical in both regions with support as high as 63% in Klagenfurt-Villach and 62% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. Disagreement is higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (25%) than in Klagenfurt-Villach (14%), but there are more undecided respondents in Klagenfurt- Villach with 22% compared to 13% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. In the Klagenfurt- Villach region, voters of the populist FP\u00d6 are the biggest supporters of the notion with 85%, compared to 63% on average. In the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, FP\u00d6 voters are again the biggest proponents of direct referenda with 84% compared to 62% on average for the region ( Appendix 10 : Figures 3 and 4 ).

        "35 With regard to testing authoritarian sentiment through support for a strong leader unchecked by the parliament and courts, there is a very high rejection of this notion in both regions in focus in Austria. The share of those disagreeing with this is 64% in Klagenfurt-Villach and 71% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, and the proportion of those who agree is 24% in Klagenfurt- Villach and 20% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. In the Klagenfurt-Villach region, 30% the FP\u00d6 voters support this, which is the highest among party supporters, although non-voters are much more supportive with 54%. In the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, 50% of FP\u00d6 voters support this, which is the highest among all groups. ( Appendix 10 : Figures 5 and 6 ). ",
        "36 The question of majoritarianism and the notion that governments should be able to violate civil liberties when acting in the interests of the majority is somewhat rejected, but there are regional differences. There is much stronger disagreement with this in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (82%) than in Klagenfurt-Villach (56%), but it should be noted that agreement with the proposal is quite low in both regions \u2013 15% in Klagenfurt-Villach and 13% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. A high proportion in Klagenfurt-Villach, nearly a third (29%) of respondents, is undecided. FP\u00d6 voters in the Klagenfurt-Villach region are the biggest supporters of this view with 38%, compared to just 15% on average. In the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, there is a slightly different situation as voters of the ruling \u00d6VP support this to the highest degree (26%), compared to just 8% of FP\u00d6 voters ( Appendix 10 : Figures 7 and 8 ). On the question of the impact of migration on the local economy , there are considerable differences between the two regions. About 70% in Klagenfurt-Villach disagree with the view that migration has a positive impact on the local economy, while the share for Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd is less than half (33%). The proportion of those who agree that migration is good for the local economy is much higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (42%) than in Klagenfurt-Villach (11%), and the number of undecided respondents in both regions is relatively high \u2013 20% in Klagenfurt-Villach and 26% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. In the Klagenfurt-Villach region, 83% of the populist FP\u00d6 voters and 84% of \u00d6VP voters \u2013 both governing parties \u2013 disagree with the idea, which are the highest levels among all groups. In the Nieder\u00f6sterreich- S\u00fcd region, FP\u00d6 voters, again, have the highest share (67%) of respondents who reject the proposition that migration benefits the local economy ( Appendix 10 : Figures 9 and 10 ). ",
        "37 With regard to Christianity and Catholicism as an essential component of national identity , many more agree with this notion in Klagenfurt-Villach (43%) compared to Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (8%). A large majority in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (86%) disagrees with this, while the share in Klagenfurt-Villach is 47%. In Klagenfurt-Villach, the ruling conservative \u00d6VP (67%) has the highest share of respondents who support the statement that being Catholic is essential for being truly Austrian, and their coalition partner FP\u00d6 comes second with 42%, which is close to the average of 43% for the region. In the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd region, it is the FP\u00d6 party who support this notion the most with 16%, and SP\u00d6 is second with 11% ( Appendix 10 : Figures 11 and 12 ). ",
        "38 Concerning Euroscepticism and Austria\u2019s EU membership, there is a high level of support for EU membership in both regions, but it is higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd with 60%, compared to 48% in Klagenfurt- Villach. Disagreement with EU membership is slightly higher in Klagenfurt-Villach with 35% compared to 31% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich- S\u00fcd. The share of undecided respondents is higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd with 17% while in Klagenfurt-Villach the proportion is just 9%. In Klagenfurt-Villach, FP\u00d6 party respondents show the highest level of disagreement with 83%, compared to 35% on average and just 13% for their partner in government \u00d6VP. In Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, FP\u00d6 voters have the highest disagreement rate with nearly 91% compared to 31% for the region and just 13% for \u00d6VP ( Appendix 10 : Figures 13 and 14 ). In terms of the sovereignty debate , that is, whether the European Union should return powers to the national government, respondents in both regions tend to support this proposition but to different degrees. In Klagenfurt-Villach, support is as high as 64%, while it is 45% in Nieder\u00f6sterreich- S\u00fcd. Disagreement with the proposal is higher in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (30%) than in Klagenfurt-Villach (18%). About a quarter of respondents in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd are undecided (26%), while in Klagenfurt- Villach the proportion is 18%. In Klagenfurt- Villach, FP\u00d6 voters are the biggest supporters with 91%, compared to just 18% on average for the region. In Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, a similar share of 91% FP\u00d6 voters approve of this proposition, compared to 45% on average for the region ( Appendix 10 : Figures 15 and 16 ). ",
        "39 The observations of responses to key questions on populism across political affiliation point to the following findings. With regard to anti-elitism , the populist FP\u00d6, a junior government partner, actually has a smaller share of those who agree with this populist proposition, compared to the opposition (SP\u00d6 in KV region) and politically unaffiliated (in NV region) but still comes second and ahead of the other groups. With regard to support for direct referenda , voters of the populist FP\u00d6 are the biggest supporters of the mechanism in both regions in focus in Austria. Concerning the notion of a strong, unchecked leader , FP\u00d6 voters are the biggest supporters in the NV region, but in the KV region they come second in their support after non-voters. With regard to \u201cmajoritarianism \u201d and whether the government should be allowed to breach civil liberties, FP\u00d6 voters in one region (KV) are the biggest supporters of this position, but in the other region (NV) the other ruling party \u2013 the non-populist \u00d6VP - voters support this to the highest degree and the FPO voters provide very low support. On the question of whether migration is good for the local economy , the ruling populist FPO rejects it in the highest degree in both regions in focus, and in one region (KV) its partner the non-populist \u00d6VP voters also reject it in equal measure. With regard to religious affiliation and national identity , two non-populist parties\u2019 voters are the highest supporters of this notion \u2013 \u00d6VP in KV region and the SP\u00d6 in NV and the populist FP\u00d6 voters come second in both cases. On the issue of EU membership , in both regions in focus in Austria the populist FP\u00d6 party respondents show the highest level of disagreement with this notion (with extremely high levels of over 80%-90%). With regard to the sovereignty debate, the populist FP\u00d6 voters are the biggest supporters to the notion of EU returning powers to the national government (with extremely high levels of over 90%). The comparison between the eight regions in focus (the two regions in Austria and the other six in the rest of the countries) in this study across eight key questions of the citizen surveys 35 can be seen in Appendix 6. Comparison across the eight regions in focus . The eight regions compared on key aspects of populism. 35 The citizen surveys were conducted in all eight regions in focus for the purposes of this study, using a closed-ended questionnaire. For further details and the methodology, please see the national chapters in this report. These key questions on the dimensions of populism include anti-elitist sentiments, authoritarian and majoritarian tendencies, attitudes towards migration, religion as a marker of national identity, opinion about EU membership and the sovereignty debate in the context if EU membership.

CSO environment and CSOs at regional level in Austria This section analyses the state of civil society organisations at national and regional level in Austria and is based on data from publicly available records and sources 36 . It examines the environment in which CSOs operate, the typology of CSOs at regional level and the activities CSOs undertake to address populism in view of socioeconomic factors, migration, direct democracy, Euroscepticism, EU values, civic education and the use of online disinformation. There are examples of CSOs\u2019 initiatives, but the good practices identified to highlight the positive impact CSOs can have are presented elsewhere in this report. The CSO interviews conducted especially for this study are presented in section 5.5 Findings of the expert and CSO interviews . It should be emphasised that there were vast differences in the available public information between the different countries and the different regions within the same country, with definitions and data varying substantially even within a single country or region. The analysis took these circumstances into account and 36 Sources for Austria include: http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf http://www.freiwilligenweb.at/de/freiwilliges-engagement/%C3%B6sterreich https://www.sozialministerium.at/cms/site/attachments/1/4/3/CH3434/CMS1451900458557/soziale-themen_freiwilliges- engagement_bericht-zur-lage-und-zu-den-perspektiven-des-freiwilligen-engagements-in-oesterreich.pdf http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf https://www.klagenfurt.at/_Resources/Persistent/e5370def05144622a45e0f60a562a72002218afa/Statistisches%20Jahrbuch%2 02017.pdf http://www.salzburgagentur.at/fileadmin/user_upload/StatistikAustria_2017oesterreich._zahlen._daten._fakten.pdf https://www.noe.gv.at/noe/Zahlen-Fakten/NOeSTAT_2017_www200dpi.pdf http://www.ideellarena.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/reinhard-millner.pdf https://www.klagenfurt.at/_Resources/Persistent/e5370def05144622a45e0f60a562a72002218afa/Statistisches%20Jahrbuch%2 02017.pdf http://www.wiener-neustadt.gv.at/stadt/vereine/soziales https://neuwal.com/barometer/profile.php?b=11 https://www.digitalerkompass.at/ https://www.a1.group/en/csr/media-competency 37 The civil society score of Austria fell from 0.935 in 2008 to 0.920 in 2017 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0=fragile, 1=robust. For the other countries, please see the respective country sections. 38 https://monitor.civicus.org/country/austria/ standardised the information to the extent possible; nevertheless, it necessarily imposed differences in these sections of the report between the countries and regions. The CSO environment in Austria deteriorated to a certain extent from 2008 to 2017, according to the V-Dem Core Civil Society Index ( Appendix 8: V-Dem Core Civil Society Index ), as the score for Austria fell by 1.6% between 2008 and 2017 37 , which was the smallest drop compared to France with 6.5%, Italy with 6.2% and Poland with 27.3% during this period. In Austria, the Austrian Civil Society Umbrella Group (IGO) has reported \u201cunexpected and existence-threatening\u201d cuts for organisations working on discrimination, migration, women\u2019s rights, family counselling and job integration, as well as a \u201cnever-experienced lack of access to policy-makers and consultation mechanisms\u201d 38 .

        "41 In 2017, there were an estimated 4,488 CSOs in Klagenfurt-Villach, out of which 1,024 were sports and cultural associations and 3,464 were active in other areas. 39 The sports and cultural associations represented 17% and 20% of the sector respectively, which would be above the Austrian average (see Appendix 9 ) and the rest included numerous social services, education and healthcare organisations, among others. The 48% volunteering rate for Carinthia 40 shows that volunteering is common. For Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, as of 1 January 2017, there were 3,035 associations without political affiliation 4142 . Volunteering in Nieder\u00f6sterreich in 2013 stood at 31% 43 . With regard to tackling socioeconomic issues , civil society in both Klagenfurt- Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd is strong and well-organised in providing services to the community. The \u201cbig five\u201d welfare organisations 44 \u2013 Caritas, Diakonie, Hilfswerk, Rote Kreuze and Volkshilfe \u2013 are dominant in this sector in Austria and it is no different in Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd 45 . These organisations work with local governments to provide social services. Caritas, for example, offers help and advice in financial and social emergencies, counselling and therapy, shelter and housing, work and employment, asylum, migration, and integration, care and maintenance, and disability support services. Likewise, Diakonie provides a wide range of social services to address the difficulties of people in need, such as legal advice, help with addiction, residential care, education and training, employment, counselling and migration. Hilfswerk, Rote Kreuze and Volkshilfe are similarly engaged in social welfare activities. Social services provided by CSOs in Klagenfurt are well documented 46 . There are, however, many other smaller organisations also providing such services 47 . 39 Sources: https://www.klagenfurt.at/_Resources/Persistent/e5370def 05144622a45e0f60a562a72002218afa/Statistisches%20J ahrbuch%202017.pdf http://www.salzburgagentur.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Statis tikAustria_2017oesterreich._zahlen._daten._fakten.pdf An estimate based on the respective populations of Klagenfurt and Villach.

        "42 Concerning the role of CSOs and the anti- immigration narrative , many organisations in Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, including the \u201cbig five\u201d, provide integration services to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including German language courses and access to employment, training and intercultural dialogue. Furthermore, minority groups have their own community centres, which include the indigenous Carinthian Slovenes in Klagenfurt-Villach, as well as communities from the former Yugoslavia and Islamic groups. These community centres can have a strong role in explaining migrant cultures and improving intercommunal relations. AVESTA, for example, an Afghan cultural association in Klagenfurt, works with Afghan migrants to integrate them into society and to overcome misunderstandings and differences between communities and cited the attitude of society towards migrants as a major challenge. They emphasised the need to develop intercommunal dialogue and bring people into contact with migrants to address the concerns that arise from the political and media discourse around migration, also highlighting the success that discussion and explanation can have in overcoming these differences 48 . In Klagenfurt-Villach, the study identified three organisations working to facilitate direct democracy \u2013 Aktiv Demokratie, Mehr Demokratie K\u00e4rnten and Mutb\u00fcrger \u2013 whilst in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd there is only the regional branch of Mehr Demokratie. Activities include public meetings, citizen surveys and referendum campaigns. Nationally, the Vienna-based Association for the Promotion of Political Education and Online Journalism, or neuwal, provides information on candidates and issues for elections across the country 49 . With regard to tackling online disinformation , media literacy projects in Austria aiming to address the problem of disinformation have a regional or local range, with only one national media literacy network (Medienbildung JETZT, mainly active around Vienna). The association Digitaler Kompass 50 offers workshops in Austria on the \u201ccritical and conscious use of information on the internet\u201d, with participants learning how to evaluate articles, photos and videos, as well as research the internet correctly and address the problems of disinformation, filter bubbles and hate speech on the internet, although these are only carried out in the Vienna area. The A1 telecom group runs a media literacy programme devoted to \u201cclosing the digital divide\u201d, which supports those who are disadvantaged in their access to the internet as a source of information and communication. \u201cA1 Internet for All\u201d started in Austria in 2011, providing free media competence training in three permanent locations, including Klagenfurt 51 . Euroscepticism is not actively addressed. 48 This was registered during an interview with CSOs for this study. 49 https://neuwal.com/barometer/profile.php?b=11 50 https://www.digitalerkompass.at/ 51 https://www.a1.group/en/csr/media-competency ",
        "43 5.5. Findings of the expert and CSO interviews This part presents the findings of the expert and CSO interviews 52 (see the Appendix 4 on the questionnaire and Appendix 7 for a list of interviewed experts and CSO activists ) carried out in the two regions in focus in Austria. 53 The interviewees were based in the country and in the two regions in focus. Ten in-depth interviews and two focus groups in the two regions with 16 participants in total were conducted in Austria. The answers are provided in a summarised form without referring to the names and positions of the respondents ( a list of respondents is provided in the appendices ). For the sake of the research, the opinions of CSO activists and political science experts are represented as provided in the interviews, but this should not be construed in any way as an endorsement of these views and recommendations by the research team. The questions asked about the causes of populism in Austria, the national and regional differences and similarities, and specific aspects related to populism, such as Euroscepticism, online disinformation, direct democracy and the role of CSOs, including impediments and solutions. 5.5.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level With regard to the question of the main factors that drive populism in Austria \u2013 socioeconomic or cultural \u2013 the respondents were nearly unanimous that the cultural factors are stronger, but added that both sets of factors are important and socioeconomic anxiety reinforces the cultural aspects. There were two important clarifications made about the two sets of factors by the CSO activists, political science experts and focus group participants in Austria. The socioeconomic factors are more about fear and anxiety that the situation might worsen in the future, for example due to migration or EU integration conflated with the effects of globalisation. 52 The interviewees were CSO activists and experts in political science, knowledgeable of the issues of populism and/or the civic sector on country and/or European level. One academic expert in populism contrasted the two, explaining that \u201c the socioeconomic one would be more a statement by someone wanting to take something away from me and the cultural issue is the challenge of integration, identity \u201d. Regional focus group participants pointed out that people in difficult socioeconomic circumstances are not bound to vote for populists, so this cannot be an excuse, for example a citizen voting for a far right xenophobic party cannot vindicate this action with the financial problems this citizen might have. 53 There are further conclusions, recommendations and cross-country comparisons in the concluding chapter of this report. ",
        "44 As noted above, there is nearly unanimous opinion on the role of factors, but with one exception \u2013 local officials and politicians who were interviewed for this study were more inclined to think that socioeconomic factors are more important than, or equally as important as, the cultural factors . According to one participant, the socioeconomic problems are the first to be felt by people, who care about incomes, housing, welfare and normal life. At the same time, all interviewees noted that the social and economic situation and public services in Austria are excellent, which leads back to the proposition that it is more about anxiety than the actual situation. The participants provided further details that are important for understanding the reasons for populism in Austria. Many of them noted that populists exploit and increase public concerns, such as the fear of the unknown . The dominant populist or national populist discourse simplifies the situation and feeds on emotions, and existing aggressive marketing strategies and the media environment and short political cycles contribute to propelling populists to power. With regard to the FP\u00d6 party, it was noted that they exploit three topics \u2013 immigration, national identity and a kind of welfare chauvinism. About Austria specifically, there is an additional outtake as most of the participants noted that it is not about populism in general, but about a populist radical right party (FP\u00d6), while there are no populist far-left parties in the country. Also, some political science experts, as well as focus group participants, noted that the term \u201cpopulism\u201d is too broad or unclear for them, so they prefer to identify those parties as national populists or radical right parties. Participants also noted the role of anti- establishment attitudes against mainstream parties in the rise of populism in Austria. The situation is specific in Austria, as the populist party, FP\u00d6, is in power as a junior government partner. According to interviewees, the leading government partner is giving a free hand to FP\u00d6 in their populist agenda as long as they don\u2019t oppose the neoliberal economic agenda. According to some opinions, this moderates FP\u00d6\u2019s agenda to an extent, but it gives them tools for influence. In other words, the participation of FP\u00d6 has two opposite effects. On the one hand, being in power restrains some of their positions and behaviour. On the other hand, being in the government provides them with control of institutions and therefore leverages to implement other policies. ",
        "45 With regard to the question of whether there are differences in the factors of populism in the different regions , there were three interesting points made by the CSO activists, political science experts and focus group participants. First, most of the interviewees thought that, in general, the role of the different factors is similar across the country, that is, they have national influence . Secondly, according to one political science expert, the rural-urban divide, geographic proximity and the role of neighbouring countries around border areas may have some influence, but it is, above all, a city - countryside divide. Third, there is an example of the Carinthia region, the former stronghold of the populist FP\u00d6 party, which made a turn and is now dominated by a non-populist party after FP\u00d6 descended into corruption scandals. In the focus groups with diverse participants from the two regions, however, there were concerns voiced about perceived unfairness, which gives birth to populism \u2013 i.e. migrants and refugees receiving the same or more generous allowances and public services than local pensioners, which needs to be addressed. On the question of how populist parties rank as a challenge , a number of interviewees (experts and CSO activists) in Austria thought that \u201c when it comes to the rule of law and the European values, this is a European wide challenge\u201d as defined by an academic expert in populism . There was a high degree of concern among those interviewed that the example of neighbouring countries, such as Hungary and Italy with Viktor Orban and Matteo Salvini, is the main challenge for liberal democracy. Another academic expert in populism pointed out the dangers of polarisation in society posed by populism: With regard to the question of populist party weaknesses , i.e. what drives people away from them and what limits their support, the interviewees made several points. The main weakness identified was that populist parties did not actually have concrete policies to improve the problems at hand, e.g. \u201c it is a lot about \u201cshort- termism\u201d versus sustainable solutions \u201d, as one academic expert in populism defined it. This is especially valid for the economy as economic issues are not part of their core ideology and core interests. The respondents also recounted the indicative story of FP\u00d6 losing its stronghold of Carinthia as corruption cases damaged the party\u2019s reputation. ",
        "46 The change of leadership after the death of Joerg Haider was also partly blamed for the poor fortunes of the party as it relied very much on his personal charisma. Responses in the focus group in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd emphasised the role of fundamental values: \u201cI think they are very blatantly going against very fundamental values, universal values that are constitutional values for almost all the nation states\u201d as defined by a focus group participant. Another participant reminded that the very history of FP\u00d6, related to WWII-era Nazi party members, played a strong role in deterring voters from actually casting a vote for them. Regarding the question of whether populists might have a valid point in some cases even though people disagree with them in general, the interviewees said that the populists\u2019 tactic was to select existing issues that attracted people\u2019s attention but then inflate their anxieties, such as with asylum seekers, migrants or criticising government actions. The focus group in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd reached a conclusion that populists benefit from criticism of globalisation as people are afraid of losing their privilege. The interviewees and focus group participants in Austria share the opinion that politicians \u2013 populist and mainstream \u2013 bear a lot of responsibility . The populists are considered to instrumentally polarise and divide society. It is worth quoting an Austrian academic expert in populism in full regarding this issue: ",
        "47 5.5.2. Related aspects: direct democracy, online disinformation and Euroscepticism The question of direct democracy and, specifically, the issue of referenda being used more often elicited very carefully crafted answers among the interviewees in Austria. They generally considered that it is a good instrument of democracy, but it should be applied under several very strict conditions. First, it demands a very well-informed electorate , including preparation about the referendum questions, information about what it entails, what the consequences will be and quality discussions. Secondly, the questions should be practical with a clear outcome . Examples given for such referenda questions were tangible issues, such as about whether to hold the Olympic Games or construct a public building, or not. Thirdly, local referenda would work much better than national ones as they will be closer to, and more understandable for, the people. The interviewed said that while populists initially favoured referenda, they started to dislike and disregard them as soon as people voted against the populist agenda, such as with the smoking ban. At both the focus groups \u2013 in Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd \u2013 the younger participants tended to be more sceptical about using referenda as they lacked transparency due to the current government with populists in power and Brexit, as well, was evoked as an example of the damage that can be done to the younger generation. Overall, the predominant opinion was very cautious as focus group participants defined it and one of them in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd -defined it : \u201cI think we would need the right environment for direct democracy. If we start doing direct democracy by doing referendums it goes wrong. People don\u2019t have the right education for it.\u201d ... \u201cPeople need to grow up with it [direct democracy]\u201d. Concerning the role of online disinformation and populism, some interviewees in Austria pointed out that populism in Austria preceded the wave of disinformation, but generally all interviewees admitted its responsibility in the rise of populism. The participants in the Klagenfurt-Villach focus group agreed that social media is responsible and that traditional media were not affected to that effect, but the other focus group in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd pointed out that media have their political and economic interests as well. One academic expert in populism , however, pointed to the specific media structure in Austria with one broadsheet dominating the country and catering more or less to the populists and just a small number of liberal media with limited influence. All interviewees thought that measures should be taken against online disinformation, including fact- checking, online transparency and information, and launching local discussions with citizens to counter disinformation. ",
        "48 In terms of Euroscepticism and populism , the interviewees in Austria pointed out that they are closely related. According to one academic expert in populism , populists in Austria used to be pro-European, but then they decided that they could benefit from blaming the EU as it couldn\u2019t defend itself. The populists, being nationalists and nativists, are against anything transnational, blaming the EU for the inflow of migrants to replace the local population. The deeper problem, according to another academic expert in populism , is that there are no really committed main pro-European parties as even the mainstream ones are afraid to stand up to the anti-European trends. The 2019 European Parliament elections were also briefly discussed in view of the possible higher vote share for populists, as well as the possibility of populists being nominated as European Commissioners. At one of the focus groups, participants discussed the idea that Euroscepticism and populism can be unrelated as the EU is very complex and generally unknown and people have problems identifying with it. 5.5.3. Measures and levels of addressing the populist challenge With regard to measures to counter the rise of populism and its effects, the interviewees identified a series of possibilities. First, legislative measures to counter the breach of red lines (e.g. European values and rules) and the imposition of sanctions if necessary, which would be at national and European level. Secondly, better media that will not polarise people and thrive on scandals and disinformation, e.g. fighting political rhetoric and disinformation. The media dimension would also require safeguarding media freedom and education and information for citizens, including for young people. There is, also, the responsibility of politicians for a new agenda and narrative to avoid such polarisation in the media. The third element would be new models for participation . These would aim to guarantee more participation at local, national, regional and transnational level by creating and implementing models for such participation and also educating people about them. According to other interviewees, the most important aspects of tackling populism are to avoid copying their style and positions and decrease polarisation. As populists are loud minorities, the silent majorities have to be included and given greater coverage in the media. Populists should be confronted every time on their manipulations, i.e. regaining the initiative in public debates. A key measure, according to a number of interviewees, was education \u2013 civic education, starting from schools, media literacy education and dealing with social networks. The participants in one of the focus groups identified a number of measures to counter both the socioeconomic and cultural factors of populism: dealing with financial inequality, poverty, unemployment and social welfare, as well as fighting racism and disinformation, strengthening trust in democracy and tackling Euroscepticism. Addressing socioeconomic issues should not be underestimated as these issues affect people\u2019s lives. ",
        "49 5.5.4. Populism, impediments to CSOs and civil society responses With regard to specific CSO initiatives and organisations working to tackle the negative aspects of populism, the interviewees generally did not recognise populism as a separate field of work in itself, but rather identified it through related aspects. These include working with refugees, women\u2019s rights, promoting EU values, human rights, disinformation and media literacy, direct or participatory democracy, digital democracy and active citizenship through a variety of activities such as democracy workshops, public meetings and discussions and citizen surveys (e.g. many of the measures outlined in the previous two subsections can also be implemented by CSOs). Respondents in Austria also pointed to expressing civil society positions through regular demonstrations against the current government with the populist FP\u00d6, especially in the capital, but also elsewhere in the country and in the regions. The big, international civil society groups, such as Caritas and Amnesty International, as well as the smaller, national organisations, such as SOS Mitmensch and student groups, were mentioned as trying to confront and expose the populist far right. Protests against working conditions were also mentioned (12 hour working day) as attracting anti-populist players. On the most serious impediments to CSOs tackling the populist challenge , the interviewees in Austria pointed to three groups of problems. First, there are attempts to limit funding to organisations dealing with migrant and women\u2019s rights. This takes place, specifically, at national level for now and not so much at local level. Secondly, there are problems with attracting donations and volunteers, which is a result of negative public campaigning against CSOs, which is the third problem. Negative campaigning by FP\u00d6 is against pro-asylum, anti-fascist, women\u2019s rights and LGBT groups. Another problem was summarised by a focus group participant in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, as people, especially officials, are not publicly populist, but practically isolate CSOs: ",
        "50 It is important to note the discussion in one of the focus groups, as participants underlined education, information and civic engagement as the top priorities in both the short and the long term and more transparency and visibility as steps to be undertaken in the short term. Improving CSOs\u2019 \u201ccommunication\u201d in a broader sense was a key measure repeated by many interviewees, and it was implied to be through either marketing or ongoing exchanges with people to understand their concerns or change attitudes, explaining better what CSOs do to the public or cooperating with local authorities if this would make local citizens trust them more. For example, the Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd focus group participants emphasised that big CSOs could develop more professional marketing and communication approaches, similar to corporate ones, and added that this is not necessarily bad thing. All members of the Klagenfurt-Villach focus group said that They also recommended working with local authorities, as people were not aware of the work of CSOs, trying to reach out to the citizens and involving volunteers. For example, according to focus group participants, the younger generation was aware of CSO activities, but the older generation was not \u2013 hence the misunderstanding and negative attitudes. With regard to possible allies, interviewees mentioned that CSOs should be cooperating more with each other, especially for the big CSOs to work with the smaller ones. The other important elements that are missing, according to them, are a lack of strong anti-populist parties as well as the aversion of trade unions to oppose the populists in government. Among the more specific actions recommended were sports activities (football was mentioned), art projects, cooking as an effective way to involve citizens and refugees and change perceptions, more and constant information on social media, working with schools and talking about radicalisation, racism and immigration. The interviewees recommended training workshops against the populist discourse along the lines of the Caritas project \u201cZusammenReden\u201d (talking together), which counters the so-called \u201cStammtischparolen\u201d associated with populist behaviour (or bumper-sticker wisdom, bar talk often directed against foreigners). \u201c CSOs should focus on communication because otherwise people will stick to their narrow-minded opinion \u201d ",
        "51 The participants also underlined the importance of personal experience . For example, the value of volunteering was that citizens get a first-hand experience, which changes perceptions. One participant in the focus group in Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd said that With regard to necessary resources , the interviewees in Austria mentioned political science expertise and knowhow, human and financial resources, communication skills, building networks and cooperation to be able to implement the recommendations at different levels \u2013 regional, national and European. 5.6. Conclusions and recommendations for Austria 5.6.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level In Austria, cultural factors are a stronger driver of populism than socioeconomic ones , but both sets of factors are important and reinforce each other as socioeconomic anxiety reinforces the cultural aspects. When talking about populist parties in Austria, it is not about populism in general, but about a populist radical right party (FP\u00d6), which is currently a junior government partner. There are no populist far left parties in the country. The three main topics exploited by FP\u00d6 are immigration, national identity and a kind of \u201cwelfare chauvinism\u201d. The influence of both cultural and socioeconomic factors is generally uniform across the country with no substantial regional differences . However, a rural-urban divide, geographic proximity and the role of neighbouring countries around border areas may be influential. Above all else, there is a city-countryside divide that plays a role . \u201c Civic engagement is important. Experience needs to be transformative. Talking to people is not enough. But after engaging in a relationship they gain substantial, significant experience on a closer personal and social level. Then there is the moment when there is a window of opportunity that actually can open and people can start to change their minds and views. \u201d ",
        "52 Speaking about populism in non-metropolitan areas in Austria, there is the example of the Carinthia region, the former stronghold of the populist FP\u00d6 party, which took a turn politically after FP\u00d6 descended into corruption scandals and is now dominated by a non-populist party. The mainstream parties are also considered responsible for the rise of populism as they failed to address the issues that later helped populist advance and avoided taking a stand as they feared this would hurt their political positions. Direct democracy is considered a good instrument of democracy, but it should be applied under several very strict conditions: a very well-informed electorate, sufficient preparation about the referendum questions and the potential consequences and the questions should be practical with a clear outcome. Generational differences exist in regard to direct democracy as the younger participants in both focus groups (in Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd) were more sceptical about using referenda due to the current government, which includes the populist FP\u00d6, and Brexit was invoked as an example of the damage that can be done to the younger generation. Generally, the rise of populism in Austria preceded online disinformation , but the latter is responsible for the spread of populist messages, which needs to be addressed. Views on traditional media and its role in Austria are divided as some view it as unaffected, but one country expert considered that the domination by a single populist-dominated broadsheet was a problem. There is a close link between Euroscepticism and populism in Austria, which is characterised by nationalism and nativism. The populist FP\u00d6 is opposed to anything transnational and blames the EU for the inflow of migrants, which populists think will replace the local population. Another identified problem is the lack of really committed pro-European parties, even among the mainstream, as they avoid standing up to the anti-European trends. ",
        "53 5.6.2. Conclusions regarding the role of civil society organisations With regard to tackling socioeconomic issues, civil society in both Klagenfurt- Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd is strong and well-organised in providing services to the community, especially through the \u201cbig five\u201d welfare organisations \u2013 Caritas, Diakonie, Hilfswerk, Rote Kreuze and Volkshilfe. They also provide integration services to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, such as German language courses and access to employment, training and intercultural dialogue. Calls for greater direct democracy and the challenge of online disinformation are addressed to a lesser extent and Euroscepticism is largely not addressed by local CSOs. The CSO mapping in the regions, which was conducted based on the available public, national and regional databases 54 in order to identify the potentially relevant CSOs per region vs. all the other registered CSOs, supports these observations. Table 9. Relevant CSOs on regional level in Austria Region Total CSOs in the region Potentially relevant CSOs in the regions of Austria % EU values Civic education and engagement Disinfor mation Minoritie s, migrants and multi- culturalis m Civil libertie s Direct democracy and participatio n Total CSOs relevant KV 4,488 7 2 1 39 0 5 51 1.14 % NO-S 3,035 1 0 0 5 0 2 7 0.23 % Some organisations are active in multiple areas, so the sum of the column of activities and total number at the end may differ. In the Klagenfurt-Villach region of Austria, there are an estimated 4,488 CSOs, of which 1.14%, or 51, were deemed to have potentially relevant activities: 7 working on European values, 2 on civic education and engagement, 1 on disinformation and the vast majority \u2013 39 \u2013 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism. 54 The data sources are as follows: Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd: http://www.wiener- neustadt.gv.at/stadt/vereine/soziales; https://www.herold.at/gelbe-seiten/lilienfeld- mariazell/verband-verein-u-organisation/; http://www.integration- noe.at/fileadmin/Einrichtungslisten/Neunkirchen.pdf; https://www.ngojobs.eu/ngos/; In Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd, out of 3,035 CSOs, about 0.23% \u2013 or 7 \u2013 were deemed to be potentially relevant: 1 involved in EU values, 5 working on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism and 2 on direct democracy and participation.

",
        "54 Reasons for the weak CSO response to the populist challenge include the fact that \u201cpopulism\u201d is not recognised as a separate field of work in itself and limited funding to organisations dealing with migrant and women\u2019s rights. This, combined with negative campaigning by FP\u00d6 against pro-asylum, anti-fascist, women\u2019s rights and LGBT groups, a lack of \u201ccommunication\u201d skills at CSOs and negative public campaigning against CSOs, results in difficulties attracting donations and volunteers and the isolation of CSOs by public officials when it comes to debates and decision-making. 5.6.3. Recommendations 1 Civic education , including media literacy, dealing with social networks and new forms of citizen engagement should be introduced. 2 Safeguarding measures against online disinformation should be implemented. 3 New models for participation at local, national, regional and transnational level should be developed and implemented. 4 There needs to be greater coverage in the media of the silent majorities vs. populists as loud minorities . 5 A knowledge base on populism needs to be developed as it is not recognised as a separate field of work (the term \u201cpopulism\u201d is unclear). 6 There should be training in communication tools to counter populist discourse . 7 There need to be investments in political science expertise and knowhow, human and financial resources, communication skills, network-building and cooperation to be able to counter populism at different levels \u2013 regional, national and European. 8 Sporting activities, art projects and cultural activities should be implemented as an effective way of involving citizens and refugees and changing perceptions . 9 Debates should be held in communities and with youth on social media and in schools on radicalisation, racism and immigration .

        "55 6. The case of France: populism, citizens and CSOs 6.1. The rise of populism and populist parties in France In France, populism is split between the right-wing Front National 55 (FN) of Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s radical leftist La France Insoumise (LFI), which can broadly be differentiated by the nationalist and anti-immigrant leanings of the right- wing and the anti-rich sentiment of the left- wing. FN, which was founded by Le Pen\u2019s father in 1972, has its ideological basis in post-Second World War ultra-nationalism, typified by anti-Semitism and xenophobia, but Le Pen has attempted to moderate that narrative 56 . LFI, by contrast, was set up by M\u00e9lenchon for the purposes of his 2017 presidential campaign and is a manifestation of the new anti-liberal populism of the left, based on a critique of austerity and neoliberalism 57 . The study identified two populist parties in France that met the selection criteria: National Rally (Rassemblement national \u2013 RN) and La France Insoumise (LFI). 55 Known as Rassemblement National since 1 June 2018. 56 Ivaldi, G., & Gombin, J., \u201cThe Front National and the new politics of the rural in France\u201d, 2015. 57 Ivaldi, G., Zaslove, A., & Akkerman, A., \u201cLa France populiste ? \u201d, 2017.

It scores the parties along five dimensions on a scale 1 to 10, lowest to highest. The data used was the available from the Chapel Hill Political science expert Survey (CHES). See also Appendix 22 . ",
        "56 RN was known until June 2018 as Front national (FN) and is still referred to often in this way. RN\u2019s programme focuses on the return of four sovereignties \u2013 monetary, legislative, budgetary and territorial \u2013 requiring either a renegotiation with the EU or a \u2018Frexit\u2019, limiting immigration and fighting multiculturalism. 58 Le Pen has gained support in non-metropolitan France, reflecting the geography of social and economic inequality, and supports the hard-working \u2018little people\u2019 against the elite. She advocates welfare nationalism, anti- globalisation, anti-immigration and interventionist and protectionist economic policies. In her anti-elite narrative, the common interests of the people are threatened by a powerful globalist elite. 59 The core message of her 2017 presidential campaign was to \u201cgive France its freedom back and give the people a voice.\u201d 60 She has called for policies of \u201cnational preference\u201d \u2013 softened to \u201cnational priority\u201d \u2013 which she would enshrine in the constitution, and a drastic reduction in immigration, describing immigration in France as a \u201ctragedy\u201d 61 and a threat to France\u2019s national identity and social welfare system 62 . RN scores very highly on all measures of populism. LFI, the other French party in the study, is built, like RN, around the politics of its leader, and is founded on the belief that traditional parties and political organisations no longer serve democracy, insisting upon the need to get rid of elites 58 Bourekba, M., \u201cPopulism in France: Towards Normalisation\u201d, 2017. 59 Ivaldi & Gombin, 2015. 60 Melander, I., \u201cLe Pen kicks of campaign with promise of French \u2018freedom\u2019\u201d, Reuters, 2017 - https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-fn/le- pen-kicks-off-campaign-with-promise-of-french-freedom- idUSKBN15J007 61 Rassemblement National, Grand Meeting de Marine Le Pen au Z\u00e9nith de Paris, 2017 - cited in Ivaldi, G., Crowding the market: the dynamics of populist and mainstream competition in the 2017 French presidential elections, 2018 - https://www.rassemblementnational.fr/videos/grand- meeting-de-marine-le-pen-au-zenith-de-paris/ who concentrate power and wealth. M\u00e9lenchon rejects globalisation and European integration, promising to hold a renegotiation with the EU and possibly a referendum on leaving the Union. 63 M\u00e9lenchon purports to offer an alternative to neoliberal hegemony, and has called upon the \u201cera of the people\u201d ( L\u2019\u00e8re du peuple ), inciting people to \u201cclear out\u201d politicians ( d\u00e9gagisme ) and \u201csweep away the oligarchy and abolish the privileges of the political caste\u201d 64 . M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s \u2018people\u2019 consists of the social groups at the bottom of society. He has pledged to eradicate poverty and unemployment, raise the highest tax rate to 90%, raise taxes on capital, expand public services, nationalise the banking sector, raise wages and lower the retirement age to 60. 65 On Europe, M\u00e9lenchon has shown particular antipathy towards the posted workers directive, stating that posted workers \u201csteal the bread from local workers\u201d. LFI is strongly anti-elite and Eurosceptic, but is weak on the other measures. Despite this, there are signs that LFI is increasingly resorting to patriotic values and has abandoned previous celebrations of ethnic diversity and multiculturalism 66 . 62 Rassemblement National, UDT Marseille : Discours de Marine le Pen, 201 5 \u2013 cited in Ivaldi, G., Crowding the market: the dynamics of populist and mainstream competition in the 2017 French presidential elections, 2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkEJoz7GZQI 63 Bourekba, M., \u201cPopulism in France: Towards Normalisation\u201d, 2017. 64 Ivaldi, G., \u201cCrowding the market: the dynamics of populist and mainstream competition in the 2017 French presidential elections\u201d, 2018. 65 Ibid. 66 Ibid. ",
        "57 The regional trends in the populist vote in the two regions of France- Aisne and Dr\u00f4me, show that in the period 2008-2018 the populist demonstrates slow decrease in the start of the period and then increase from 2012 onwards (please, see the trends and comparison across all eight regions in the Appendix 3: The populist vote at regional level: an overview of trends across regions and time ). 6.2. Demographic indicators and the populist vote in France at national level The study also carried out an analysis of a number of demographic indicators \u2013 gender, age, education and employment \u2013 to examine their relationship with populist voting patterns at national level 67 . In terms of gender , a greater proportion of votes cast by men were for populist parties in both 2017 French elections. In the legislative election, in particular, Front National performed noticeably better with men than with women. In terms of age , young people aged 18-24 voted for populist parties more than twice as frequently as those aged 70 or over in the 2017 presidential election. In particular, the vote received by La France Insoumise is closely correlated with age, with younger voters much more likely to vote for M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party. Front National is most popular with those aged 35- 49 and becomes less popular as voters get younger or older from this mid-point. This is an example in which young people are not only more likely to vote for populist parties overall, but are willing to accept a newer party, rather than one that has inhabited the system for some time. 67 The study used national exit poll data, which provides an estimate as to the voting behaviour of particular demographic groups, to consider possible trends in voting patterns across these groups, both within individual countries and for particular parties. It allowed also for observations of any common features that hold across the countries studied. The analysis is on national level, based on available public data and the analysis on regional level is based on the citizen surveys, conducted for the purposes of this study. ",
        "58 In terms of education and employment , both the presidential and legislative French elections of 2017 displayed a clear relationship between education and populist voting behaviour, e.g. those with less than a high school education were more likely to vote for FN, while those with a university or postgraduate qualification were more likely to vote for LFI. When looking at the vote shares received by Front National and La France Insoumise individually, this general trend presents itself very clearly in the pattern of FN (RN currently) voters but appears not to hold for LFI votes. Indeed, those who received less than a complete high school education were much less likely to vote for M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party than those with at least a high school diploma. Similarly, it seems that LFI was most popular amongst those with a university degree. Likewise, the pattern of populist voting behaviour in the 2017 French elections showed a clear trend with regard to employment status. Overall, those who worked in more professionalised jobs were less likely to vote for a populist party. This pattern held for both elections that took place that year. Again, the overall populist vote declined between the presidential election in April and the legislative election in June. The only relative difference with regard to employment is that there appeared to be a smaller decrease in populist vote share amongst self-employed individuals than other categories of worker. When examining the vote share received by specific parties, it is once again clear that the patterns of Front National votes follow the general trend. To an extent, the overall trend was mirrored in the votes received by M\u00e9lenchon in the presidential election, although in a muted form. In contrast, the pattern of voting behaviour in the legislative election shows that white- collar and intermediate workers actually gave a greater proportion of their votes to LFI than blue-collar workers. Furthermore, self-employed workers and unemployed people appeared to make up a relatively smaller part of LFI\u2019s base in the June election than they did in April. ",
        "59 6.3. Citizen surveys in the Aisne and Dr\u00f4me regions of France The citizen surveys, as was the case with the other countries, focused on eliciting the opinion of citizens specifically in the two regions in focus in France \u2013 Aisne and Dr\u00f4me (abbreviated respectively as AI and DR). 68 The current sample sizes in terms of age, gender, education, occupation, income brackets, religious affiliation and political preferences provide a suitable basis for the purposes of the study as there are respondents within all main demographic categories listed above (e.g. 48% male and 52% female in Aisne and 39% and 61% in Dr\u00f4me respectively). A total of 65 respondents 69 from Aisne and 66 respondents 70 from Dr\u00f4me took part in the survey. As noted in the beginning of this report, the two regions were selected for their different socioeconomic characteristics and the level of the populist vote in the regions (please, see also Appendix 21 ). The table below shows the main indicators. Aisne, which is located in the north of the country, is the less wealthy of the two with a GDP 70% of the EU28 average. Dr\u00f4me, which is located in the south of France, has a GDP 97% of the EU28 average, but still lower than the national average of France of 105%. The two regions have similar population numbers. Table 11. Socioeconomic characteristics of the two regions in France Country/Region GDP PPS % of EU28 average GDP PPS per inhabitant (regional)/Real GDP per capita (national) Total population Population density (km2) Largest urban area France 105% 32,300 66,759,950 105.5 6,754,282 Dr\u00f4me 97% 28,100 504,637 78.3 127,559 Aisne 70% 20,200 538,659 72.7 110,369 The current analysis is based on select questions pertinent to the five dimensions of populism as identified in this study: anti-elite, majoritarian, authoritarian, monocultural and Eurosceptic with an additional focus on issues such as direct democracy and sovereignty. 68 The survey included 36 closed-ended questions and demographic information about the respondents for each of the two regions. It was carried out online on a voluntary basis. They are exploratory surveys meant to complement the other survey methods such as in-depth interviews and focus groups as the samples are small for a fully-fledged, representative study. A fully representative study would require a sample of some 380 people per region. 69 In Aisne, out of 65 respondents, who responded to the political affiliation question, 18.50% (12) marked La R\u00e9publique En Marche!, 4.60% (3) Les R\u00e9publicains, 18.50% (12) Front national, 7.70% (5) La France insoumise, 6.20% (4) Parti socialiste, 12.30% (8) other, 27.70% (18) non-voters, 4.60% (3) preferred not to say. 70 In Dr\u00f4me, out of 65 respondents, who responded to the political affiliation question, 23.10% (15) marked La R\u00e9publique En Marche!, 6.20% (4) Les R\u00e9publicains, 6.20% (4) Front national, 16.90% (11) La France insoumise, 7.70% (5) Parti socialiste, 13.80% (9) other, 23.10% (15) non-voters, 3.10% (2) preferred not to say. ",
        "60 Moreover an analysis of the socio- demographic characteristics of the respondents is provided based on the respective questions in the citizen survey. With regard to age group and party preferences, the respondents of the two populist parties LFI and FN in both Aisne and Dr\u00f4me tend to be somewhat younger, compared, for example, to Les R\u00e9publicains and En Marche! respondents, but in Dr\u00f4me they also have a higher share of older groups over 55 years old ( Appendix 14 : Figures 1 and 2 ). There is a more or less balanced representation in Aisne and Dr\u00f4me in terms of gender for both LFI and FN ( Appendix 14 : Figure 7 and 4 ). FN respondents, in general, have lower levels of education compared to the other parties, whilst LFI respondents tend to have more university (bachelor), or equivalent, and other professional qualifications ( Appendix 14 : Figures 8 and 6 ). In terms of employment status , the full- timed employed in Aisne are among the biggest groups in both LFI (40%) and FN (46%) respondents. In Dr\u00f4me, there are equal proportions of FN voters who are fully employed or unemployed, whilst there are more retired persons among LFI respondents ( Appendix 14 : Figures 9 and 8 ). FN and LFI respondents also tended to be from lower income brackets ( Appendix 14 : Figures 10 and 10 ). In terms of religion , in Aisne, both LFI (40%) and FN (54%) have a lower share of Catholics than the average for the region in the survey (58%) and, at the same time, a higher share of non-religious voters \u2013 40% for LFI and 46% for FN, compared to a 29% average for all respondents in the region. In Dr\u00f4me, FN respondents have the highest share of Catholics (80%) and, in comparison, LFI have the highest share of non-religious respondents \u2013 64% ( Appendix 14 : Figures 11 and 12 ). Concerning anti-elitist attitudes , registered by the statement \u201cpoliticians are from a different socioeconomic class to other citizens\u201d, respondents in both French regions largely subscribe to this notion and provide almost identical answers \u2013 56% in Dr\u00f4me and 58% in Aisne agree with this and only 20% and 21%, respectively, disagree. In Aisne, the vast majority of supporters of the populist LFI and FN agree with this statement \u2013 80% and 92%, respectively, with non-voters and those who did not express a political affiliation coming next with 44% and 38%, respectively. In comparison, in Aisne Les R\u00e9publicains and En Marche! supporters are equally divided by support (33%), undecided and rejection by 33%. The results for Dr\u00f4me on this question show similar results \u2013 73% of LFI voters agree with it as well as 50% of FN supporters and 60% of non-voters, which is generally either equal or higher than supporters of other parties. E.g. in Dr\u00f4me, among the non- populist parties this anti-elitist proposition is supported by 50% of Les R\u00e9publicains supporters, 50% of supporters of En Marche!, 60% of PS voters ( Appendix 13 : Figures 1 and 2 ). ",
        "61 With regard to direct democracy , e.g. opinions on using more direct referenda , the majority of respondents in both regions in France support this notion to almost the same extent, with 61% in Aisne and 63% in Dr\u00f4me in favour. Those opposing it have a share of 19% in Aisne and 17% in Dr\u00f4me. The highest support in Aisne for more direct referenda is among En Marche! voters (83%) followed by supporters of LFI (80%), Parti socialiste (PS) (66%) and FN (59%). The biggest rejection of this notion is among the supporters of other, smaller parties (38%) and Les R\u00e9publicains (33%). In Dr\u00f4me, support for referenda is highest among the non-populist PS (100%), other, smaller parties (78%), En Marche! (66%) and Les R\u00e9publicains (50%), and the populist FN and LFI at 50% and 55% respectively ( Appendix 13 : Figure 3 and 4 ). Figure 15. Direct referenda ",
        "62 In terms of authoritarian tendencies , respondents in both French regions oppose the notion of a strong leader, unchecked by the national assembly and the courts, although to a different degree \u2013 52% in Aisne and 64% in Dr\u00f4me showing disagreement. In comparison, 27% in Aisne and 19% in Dr\u00f4me are in agreement. Levels of support for a strong leader in the region of Aisne are similar across nearly all parties, except for non-voters with 17% (only the share among those who did not give a political affiliation is zero). The populist LFI supporters oppose it by 80%, but the share of rejection is smaller among FN voters at 50%. There is a strong level of rejection of this proposition among populist party voters in Dr\u00f4me, too, with much higher disagreement among LFI (91%) than FN voters (50%). LFI voters, in fact, show higher levels of disagreement on this issue than all other groups ( Appendix 13 : Figures 7 and 8 ). Figure 16. Strong, unchecked leader On the issue of \u201cmajoritarianism\u201d \u2013 that is, breaching civil liberties by the government for the sake of the majority , the majority of respondents reject this notion, with 54% in Aisne and 64% in Dr\u00f4me. Only 15% in Aisne and 17% in Dr\u00f4me agree but no respondents expressed strong agreement. The highest support for \u201cmajoritarianism\u201d is among the non-populist Les R\u00e9publicains, with 67%, and other, smaller parties, with 38%. It is opposed by non-populists and populists alike. For example, among supporters of the non-populist PS, the share is 75%, and among En Marche! voters support is at 42%, i.e. 42% of them oppose majoritarianism compared to 25% who support the idea and 33% who are undecided. Among supporters of the populist LFI and FN, 80% and 67%, respectively, reject it. In Dr\u00f4me, the highest support is among Les R\u00e9publicains and En Marche! supporters \u2013 50% and 47%, respectively. Populist party voters rather oppose it \u2013 FN by 50% and LFI by 82%, with all other parties also opposing the notion ( Appendix 13 : Figures 5 and 6 ). ",
        "63 With regard to migration and its economic aspects , there are marked differences between the two regions. A majority \u2013 54% \u2013 of respondents in Dr\u00f4me agree or strongly agree that migration has a positive impact on the local economy, while only 16% of respondents in Aisne are in agreement. A total of 22% in Dr\u00f4me disagree, while a majority in Aisne (55%) disagree. There is a high proportion of undecided respondents in both regions \u2013 24% in Dr\u00f4me and 29% in Aisne. In Aisne, populist FN supporters show the highest level of disagreement (83%) followed by the non-populist PS (67%) and non-voters (64%). It should be noted that supporters of LFI, the other populist party, are equally split between agreement and disagreement with this notion, with 40% in each case. In Dr\u00f4me, LFI supporters show the most support for the economic benefits of migration (82%), as well as FN voters (50%), which is on a par with supporters of other ( Appendix 13 : Figures 9 and 10 ). ",
        "64 As there are regional differences, the additional questions on migration 71 are explored to provide further explanations (see below). It can be concluded that respondents in Dr\u00f4me accept migration to a higher degree in its economic and cultural aspects and do not think it is a burden to the welfare systems . On the latter point, the results show a difference between the regions, with a higher share of support in Aisne (47%) for the proposition that migrants are a burden to the welfare system than in Dr\u00f4me (33%). Only 23% of respondents in Aisne disagree, whilst the proportion in Dr\u00f4me is 50%, or nearly half of respondents. Aisne has a higher share of undecided respondents, nearly a third (31%), but only about a fifth (18%) of respondents in Dr\u00f4me are undecided. There is also a difference between the regions on the issue of whether migration enriches cultural life . This is supported by a majority of respondents in Dr\u00f4me (67%), which is almost double the figure for Aisne (34%). Disagreement with this proposition is higher in Aisne (31%) than in Dr\u00f4me (21%). In Aisne, more than a third (36%) are undecided, compared to only 13% in Dr\u00f4me. 71 The citizen surveys contain 36 questions in total with some two or more questions per topic. As a rule, the report shows analysis of responses to only the main question on a topic, but if there are substantial regional differences, the additional questions are shown to further explore these differences. ",
        "65 A majority in the two French regions reject the idea of religion as a marker of national identity with almost identical results \u2013 74% in Dr\u00f4me and 70% in Aisne. Similarly, just 5% in Dr\u00f4me and 6% in Aisne agree and about a fifth in each region are undecided \u2013 21% and 24%, respectively. Populist party supporters in Aisne respond similarly to the question of religion and national identity, with 80% of LFI voters and 83% FN supporters rejecting the proposition. They are, therefore, in line with other groups. Only FN supporters (8%) among the populist parties show some agreement with this, although Les R\u00e9publicains are much more in line with the idea with 33% expressing support. The situation in Dr\u00f4me is somewhat similar, as the highest support for this idea is among Les R\u00e9publicains, with 75%. Supporters of the populist LFI and FN have similar views, with 73% and 75%, respectively, opposing it. The rest are undecided ( Appendix 13 : Figures 11 and 12 ). There are regional differences when it comes to Euroscepticism and, specifically, EU membership , with 64% in Dr\u00f4me approving of France\u2019s EU membership compared to 44% in Aisne. Respondents in Aisne disagree that EU membership is a good thing to a higher degree (31%), compared to almost half in Dr\u00f4me (16%). 20% in Dr\u00f4me and 25% in Aisne are undecided. Highest disagreement with the view that France\u2019s membership of the EU is a good thing is found among the populist FN supporters, with 75% rejecting this and the rest undecided on the question. In comparison, just 20% of the supporters of LFI, the other populist party, are against EU membership and 60% actually support it, which is higher than the average for the region. In Dr\u00f4me, FN supporters, again, disagree most strongly with EU membership (50%), while 63% of LFI supporters, by contrast, are in favour, with none opposing it. In this region, En Marche! supporters agree to the highest extent on the benefits of EU membership (85%) ( Appendix 13 : Figures 13 and 14 ). ",
        "66 When the related questions on the EU are taken into account in order to better understand the differences between the regions (see below), it can be concluded that respondents in Dr\u00f4me support EU membership to a higher extent than respondents in Aisne, do not think that the French economy would be better off outside of the EU, are slightly more positive about EU now than 5 years ago and do not want the EU to return powers to the national government. Answers to the question of whether citizens feel more positive about France\u2019s EU membership than 5 years ago show that the predominant view in both regions is that respondents do not have an opinion on the issue, 45% in Dr\u00f4me and 41% in Aisne, but respondents in Dr\u00f4me are more inclined to feel more positively about EU membership, with 23% agreeing compared to 15% in Aisne. Around 45% in Aisne and 32% in Dr\u00f4me are less positive about EU membership. Figure 23. Attitude to EU 5 years ago A related question may shed a light whether there is an economic aspect to opinions on EU membership . A majority of respondents in Dr\u00f4me (59%) do not think that the French economy would be better off outside of the EU, compared to just 37% in Aisne. Only a small proportion of respondents in both regions agree that the French economy would be better off outside of the EU \u2013 18% in Dr\u00f4me and 19% in Aisne. It is worth noting that a very high proportion of respondents in Aisne (44%) do not have opinion on this, compared to 23% in Dr\u00f4me. ",
        "67 In terms of the sovereignty debate , answering the question of whether the EU should return powers to the national government, the largest share of respondents in both regions is undecided \u2013 43% in each region. Around 37% in Dr\u00f4me and 42% in Aisne agree with this out of which just 5% and 12%, respectively, agree categorically. Just 20% in Dr\u00f4me and 17% in Aisne do not agree that the EU should return powers to the national government. Supporters of the populist FN in Aisne agree with this notion to the highest degree (67%), while a much smaller share of LFI voters (40%) are in agreement. The rest are undecided. In Dr\u00f4me, 50% of FN supporters agree with this, which is the highest share and on a par with other, smaller parties and with those who did not specify a political affiliation. In comparison, 36% of LFI voters would like the EU to return powers to the national government, but a majority (55%) are undecided. ( Appendix 1 : Figures 15 and 16 ). Figure 25. Sovereignty and EU ",
        "68 The observations from the analysis across party affiliation of respondents show the following results (see Appendix 13: Party affiliation and key questions on populism in France for more details ). In some respects, the voters of the populist parties LFI and FN are similar to each other and different from the other parties, e.g. in showing higher support for anti-elitist positions (still mainstream parties supporters show relatively high approval of such positions too). At the same time, there are clear differences between the positions of the populist left LFI and the populist right FN voters. LFI supporters, compared to FN voters, disagree about the need for a strong leader , unchecked by parliament and courts, are inclined to favour the economic benefits of migration , They are also more supportive of EU membership and are against the EU returning powers to the national government. It is interesting to note that the supporters of non-populist parties sometimes favour positions associated with populism \u2013 the centre right Les R\u00e9publicains support \u201cmajoritarianism\u201d with breaches of civil liberties, whilst the populists \u2013 especially LFI \u2013 tend to oppose it. Les R\u00e9publicains also emphasise Catholicism as a key component of national identity more than voters of other parties. Supporters of the governing En Marche! are more supportive of direct referenda than the other groups. In one region (Aisne), the non-populist PS voters and non-voters have the second and third highest level of disagreement with the economic benefits of migration just after the populist FN supporters. The comparison between the eight regions in focus (the two regions in France and the other six in the rest of the countries) in this study across eight key questions of the citizen surveys 72 can be seen in the Appendix 6: Comparison across the eight regions in focus . 72 The citizen surveys were conducted in all eight regions in focus for the purposes of this study, using a closed-ended questionnaire. For further details and the methodology, please see the national chapters in this report. These key questions on the dimensions of populism include anti-elitist sentiments, authoritarian and majoritarian tendencies, attitudes towards migration, religion as a marker of national identity, opinion about EU membership and the sovereignty debate in the context if EU membership.

        "69 6.4. CSO environment and CSOs at regional level in France This section analyses the state of civil society organisations at national and regional level in France and is based on data from publicly available records and sources 73 as indicated in the text. 74 Due to vast differences in definitions and official information on CSOs between countries and regions, there are necessarily differences in the country sections, too. 75 The CSO environment in France deteriorated from 2008 to 2017 , according to the V-Dem Core Civil Society Index (see Appendix 8: V-Dem Core Civil Society Index ), as the country score fell by 6.5% over the period 76 , compared to decreases in the other three countries of 1.6% in Austria, 6.2% in Italy and 27.3% in 73 Sources for France include: https://www.associations.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/france_associativ e_en_mouvement_2017.pdf; R\u00e9pertoire National des Associations - https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-national- des-associations/; http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/. 13,055 entries are recorded. https://recherches- solidarites.org/media/uploads/essentiel_vie_asso_26.pdf https://www.associations.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/france_associativ e_en_mouvement_2017.pdf https://recherches- solidarites.org/media/uploads/essentiel_vie_asso_02.pdf https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de- france/aisne/possible-fin-subventions-du-conseil- departemental-aisne-inquiete-associations-1525718.html http://www.aisnenouvelle.fr/77038/article/2018-08-10/les- associations-presque-fatalistes-apres-la-disparition-des- subventions https://www.aisne.com/le-conseil-departemental/le-budget http://www.aisnenouvelle.fr/77038/article/2018-08-10/les- associations-presque-fatalistes-apres-la-disparition-des- subventions https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/01/referendum- migrants-drome-fn-enrage_n_12281770.html http://civictechno.fr/civic-theque/wpbdp_category/au- service-des-citoyens/ https://www.franceculture.fr/numerique/la-democratie- liquide-ou-comment-repenser-la-democratie-l-age- numerique https://laprimaire.org/ https://parlement-et-citoyens.fr https://democratieouverte.org/ https://www.citizenlab.co/ https://jeparticipe.auvergnerhonealpes.fr/auvergne-rhone- alpes www.action-citoyenne.org Poland. The environment for French civil society has regressed due to the state of emergency from 2015-17. The 2018 Civicus Civil Society Report 77 assesses French civil society to have \u2018narrowed\u2019, meaning that there are some violations of the rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression, occasional harassment by those in power and an undermining of press freedom. http://labelledemocratie.fr https://www.facebook.com/romanscitoyens/ http://ocdl-democratie-locale.fr/signer-la-charte-ocdl/ http://www.aisnenouvelle.fr/70308/article/2018-03- 04/abbecourt-une-association-pour-aider-les-citoyens https://www.facebook.com/pg/associationlamanufacture/ab out/?ref=page_internal European Audiovisual Observatory (2016), Mapping of media literacy practices and actions in EU-28.

There are examples of CSOs\u2019 initiatives, but the good practices identified to highlight the positive impact CSOs can have are presented elsewhere in this report. The CSO interviews conducted especially for this study are presented separately. 75 It should be emphasised that there were vast differences in the available public information between the different countries and different regions within the same country, with definitions and data varying substantially even within a single country or region. The analysis took these circumstances into account and standardised the information to the extent possible; nevertheless, it necessarily imposed differences in these sections of the report between the countries and regions. 76 The civil society score for France fell from 0.962 in 2008 to 0.899 in 2017 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0=fragile, 1=robust. For the other countries, please see the respective country sections. 77 https://monitor.civicus.org/country/france/ ",
        "70 There are currently four main challenges facing French CSOs : shrinking public funds, administrative complexity, innovation and the rise of the circular and collaborative economies 78 . Budget restrictions, especially, have had a big impact at local level, with a majority of funding switching from public to private sources. The nature of public funding has also shifted, with the financing of organisations\u2019 missions switching to contract work for local authorities. Other developments include the necessary professionalisation of civil society due to the complexity of French labour law and nature of association work becoming more technical, but social media and the circular and collaborative economies, too, have created new ways for civil society members to interact, which means informal grassroots movements tend to develop instead of associations 79 (for more information see Appendix 12: CSO typologies and developments at national level in France ). With regard to regional CSOs , as of 1 August 2018, 15,181 were registered in Dr\u00f4me 80 according to the Law of Associations 81 . The largest proportion of these \u2013 37% \u2013 is occupied by sport and leisure activities, followed by 20% in culture and 7% in education and training, and 6% in the social sector, although the figures for associations created in the last four years are probably more indicative of the activities of associations 82 . In that case, 78 http://efc.issuelab.org/resources/24213/24213.pdf 79 Ibid. 80 R\u00e9pertoire National des Associations - https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-national- des-associations/ 81 The Law of Associations is the legal basis for non-profit making organisations of two or more people. 82 The R\u00e9pertoire National des Associations records only one or two fields of activity, whereas the Journal officiel Associations records multiple sectors. 30% of associations are active in sport and leisure, 22% in culture and 12% in the social sector 83 . Besides those associations active in the social sector, very few are explicitly working in areas relevant to addressing populism. Civil society in Dr\u00f4me is characterised by small, local or regionally focused organisations \u2013 only 1,770 organisations had paid employees, 59% of them with fewer than 3 employees and 69 organisations with more than 50 employees. The social sector was overrepresented in this regard, accounting for 49.4% of employees. CSOs in Dr\u00f4me receive substantial support from volunteers, estimated to number 112- 122,000. Around 45% of them volunteer at least once a week. 84 Aisne has 5,000 fewer CSOs than Dr\u00f4me, with 10,261 registered 85 according to the Law of Associations. The R\u00e9pertoire indicates that 48% of associations in Aisne are active in the sport and leisure, followed by 13% in culture and 6% each in the social sector and education. Looking at the associations created in the past four years 86 an estimated 37% are active in the sport and leisure sectors, 18% in culture and 11% in the social sector. 83 http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/. 13,055 entries are recorded. 84 https://recherches- solidarites.org/media/uploads/essentiel_vie_asso_26.pdf 85 R\u00e9pertoire National des Associations - https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-national- des-associations/ 86 http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/. 13,055 entries are recorded. ",
        "71 This gap in numbers of CSOs between Aisne and Dr\u00f4me has also been widening in recent years. Between 2013 and 2017, the number of associations in Aisne grew by an average of 7.4 per 10,000 inhabitants and in Dr\u00f4me by 13.5 per 10,000 inhabitants, which also reflects a North- South divide in the growth of civil society in France 87 . Aisne has an estimated 19 CSOs per 1,000 inhabitants and Dr\u00f4me around 30 per 1,000 inhabitants. In 2017, there were only 1,005 organisations in Aisne with paid employees, 52% of them with fewer than 3 employees, and only 49 organisations with 50 or more employees. Employees were heavily concentrated in the social sector, which accounted for 53.5% of all employees. As in Dr\u00f4me, CSOs receive significant support from volunteers, with numbers estimated to be approximately 80- 87,000. Around 45% of them volunteer at least once a week. 88 Funding for civil society in Aisne is becoming a particular concern, especially for small CSOs, following an announcement by the President of the Council on 9 August 2018 that funding for 2019 cannot be guaranteed 89 , recommending instead that organisations budget for the next year without the Council\u2019s contribution. The announcement follows 5 years of cuts in Council subsidies to local organisations, leaving organisations with no alternative but to 87 https://www.associations.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/france_associativ e_en_mouvement_2017.pdf 88 https://recherches- solidarites.org/media/uploads/essentiel_vie_asso_02.pdf seek private funding, increase their dependence on volunteers and lose paid employees. 90 In 2018, EUR 364m was budgeted for social actions, EUR 37m for education, EUR 17m for sport and culture and EUR 10m for public health 91 . With regard to tackling socioeconomic problems , social organisations are well represented in both Dr\u00f4me and Aisne and, because of the nature of social assistance organisations, they inevitably come into contact with disadvantaged groups throughout society, including migrants and minorities. In Aisne, the challenge of replacing funds that can no longer be guaranteed by the departmental council risks compromising the capacity for organisations working in this area to address the socioeconomic causes of populism, such as inequality, employment and poverty. When it comes to countering the anti- immigration narrative , there are organisations in both regions providing for the needs of minorities and migrants, including asylum seekers and refugees, as well as organisations actively bringing communities together, fighting discrimination and exclusion, and addressing poverty and social deprivation. 89 https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de- france/aisne/possible-fin-subventions-du-conseil- departemental-aisne-inquiete-associations-1525718.html 90 http://www.aisnenouvelle.fr/77038/article/2018-08-10/les- associations-presque-fatalistes-apres-la-disparition-des- subventions 91 https://www.aisne.com/le-conseil-departemental/le-budget ",
        "72 Concerning direct democracy and increasing democratic participation , in general, the situation in France is developing 92 and the concept of \u2018liquid democracy\u2019 9394 is emerging. CSOs engaged in the process operate locally, nationally and internationally on issues such as enabling the public to select candidates for election 95 , facilitating engagement between politicians and citizens 96 , giving citizens a voice and enabling participation 97 and providing ready-to-use civic participation platforms for local government 98 . One such organisation, Civocracy 99 , facilitates public consultations for the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne- Alpes regional government, which will be available to citizens of Dr\u00f4me. There are other organisations in Dr\u00f4me active in this area, too. Action Citoyenne 100 is a movement committed to citizen participation in the Valence area so that citizens can find solutions to their own problems, such as with the economy, education and life in the city. La Belle D\u00e9mocratie 101 is an organisation that seeks to empower citizens to take control of decision-making at local level. Romans Citoyens 102 aims to use citizen engagement to strengthen French Republican values. The Citizen Observatory of Local Democracy 103 wants citizens to be listened to outside of electoral periods. 92 http://civictechno.fr/civic-theque/wpbdp_category/au- service-des-citoyens/ list of organisations 93 https://www.franceculture.fr/numerique/la-democratie- liquide-ou-comment-repenser-la-democratie-l-age- numerique 94 \u201cLiquid democracy\u201d, known also as \u201ce-Democracy\u201d or \u201cProxy Democracy\u201d is a form of direct democratic participation with the opportunity for a citizen to delegate her/his votes to another person, which can be done on issue-specific basis to different persons and can be taken back at any time. 95 https://laprimaire.org/ 96 https://parlement-et-citoyens.fr Aisne, in contrast, only has three such organisations.

        "73 Regarding online disinformation , France has a very active media literacy landscape 106 (see Appendix 12: CSO developments on national level in France ), but activities tend to be carried out by national associations that develop resources to be used directly in schools without the need for a regional intermediary. Internet Sans Crainte is important in developing the programme for Safer Internet Day, developing workshops and resources to be shared in schools, although there weren\u2019t any workshops registered in Aisne or Dr\u00f4me for the 2018 Safer Internet Day 107 . CLEMI, Le centre pour l\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias et \u00e0 l\u2019information, is a project supported by the Ministry of Education that produces resources and trains education professionals in order to facilitate the education of young people in information and media literacy. As part of its work, it encourages schools to allow students to produce their own media output. A number of schools in Aisne and Dr\u00f4me have participated in producing radio shows, newspapers and other online content 108 . Euroscepticism is not actively addressed. 6.5. Findings of the expert and CSO interviews This section presents the findings of the expert and CSO interviews and the focus group (see Appendix 4 on the questionnaire and Appendix 7 for a list of interviewed experts and CSO activists ) carried out in the two regions in focus in France. There are further conclusions, recommendations and cross- country comparisons in the concluding chapter of this report. The respondents were based in France and in the two regions in focus. Twelve in-depth interviews and a focus group in the region of Dr\u00f4me, with nine participants (local citizens, including CSO activists), were conducted in total in France. The answers are provided in a summarised form without referring to the names and positions of the respondents (a list of respondents is provided in the appendices).

        "74 6.5.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level With regard to the factors that drive populism and whether the socioeconomic or cultural factors are stronger, there were a number of astute observations by the CSO activists and political science experts in France. While the answers emphasise the role of both sets of factors, a number of opinions focused on the cultural factors as potentially stronger , such as the identity factor and the rejection of multiculturalism and migrants. On the issue of migrants, it is worth quoting a regional official interviewed for this study, who said that Nonetheless, it is important to note that, when asked about regional factors, respondents pointed to social and economic problems, as noted below in the text. For Aisne, in the north of the country, this was job losses linked to deindustrialisation as a result of globalisation, according to one interviewee, while in Dr\u00f4me it was more job insecurity. At the same time, there was a perception of abandonment and loss of control as \u201c we have a rural, peripheral France that feels further and further from the decision-making arenas but also from the big public or private services\u201d , that is, a \u201c cocktail of resentment \u201d as a political scientist and populism political science expert put it. A distinction, made by the Dr\u00f4me focus group, at regional level is that, for low income households , the main factor is the fear of poverty , with related claims that migrants receive more funding and healthcare services than citizens. For wealthier people , on the other hand, the main factor was cultural . That is, concern that migrants might change culture, disrespect traditional ways of life or bring aggression (e.g. into French society). One participant was of the opinion that the concern about migrants is higher in areas like Dr\u00f4me, which paradoxically has a lower number of migrants, meaning the issue is more about perceptions of migration (please, note that the citizens surveys in this study showed the opposite result). A participant in the regional focus group in Dr\u00f4me identified that \u201c it is less about the number or the percentage of immigrants than about the threat that a wave of immigration could represent \u201d \u201c right-wing populism has grown because of the feeling of insecurity \u2026 far-left populism is more stemming from the problems of liberalism \u2026 The gilets jaunes reflect what happens on the web and in particular on Facebook, \u2026 of fake news, of conspiracy theories\u2026\u201d. ",
        "75 A number of interviewees made a connection between the two sects of factors . One interviewee said that, for him, there is no distinction between socioeconomic and cultural factors as populism is an expression of the decline of political, social and religious forces that underpin the structure of the society. That is, socioeconomic factors do not cause populism directly, but rather cause fears about job security, income and life prospects, increasing general insecurity and removing hopes for social mobility. A very important reason for the rise of populism, often cited by the interviewees in France, is the distance and disconnect between political elites and the people as politicians do not listen to people\u2019s concerns. Another reason, which was like a red line in the focus group and the interviews, was the collapse of structures for debate on social issues, a breakdown in social cohesion and a deterioration of communal bonds that previously helped facilitate discussion and channel concerns and resentments. A focus group participant in Dr\u00f4me remarked: A feeling of loss of control was often mentioned \u2013 that is, the loss of power vis-\u00e0- vis big business and EU institutions, and that the EU has lost control of its borders, which the interviewees emphasised was not due to anti-EU feeling. One academic expert in populism pointed out that the feeling of abandonment by the state is especially acute in France and is a contributing factor for populism as the country used to rely heavily on state intervention. This adds to what an academic expert in populism identified as an \u201cintroduced form of anxiety in terms of identity and culture\u201d adding that \u201cthis was theorised as \u201ccultural insecurity\u201d\u201d. Speaking about the different factors in Europe in general, one academic expert in populism commented that, although the factors behind populism are conditioned by the different historical trajectory of each country, the common denominator is the opposition and division between the people and elites that is used by the populists. As the study coincided with the \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d (yellow jackets) protests around France, the answers provide a commentary on them, too. A focus group participant in Dr\u00f4me remarked that \u201c it is phenomenal, there\u2019s everything in this movement, plenty of frustrations and demands\u2026 Among the things that they highlight and demand, many things have actually been said over and over again, for years and years, but the people\u2019s demands haven\u2019t been taken into account, and here is the result. \u201d \u201cwe can see a collapse of the associative sphere, people are pitted against each other, we are not in a spirit of living together anymore\u201d. With regard to the growing polarisation, another participant noted candidly that \u201c What shocks me the most is that we have the feeling that we cannot live without having a neighbour to hate.\u201d ",
        "76 The geographical location mattered too, for example, according to one interviewee (a CSO representative from the region) Aisne\u2019s location near the Belgian border has brought about job competition for truck drivers from Central and Eastern Europe (i.e. the CEE EU member states that apparently used the region as both a base of operations and transit route). In fact, resentment against EU member states in CEE, such as Poland, was mentioned as French production and businesses have moved there and that there is a perception that those countries have misused EU funds that come from countries like France. It is important to note a regional perspective that, along with the disengagement of people in general from politics, there is also a growing reluctance on the part of politicians to run for public office. For example, a considerable proportion of current mayors does not want to run again due to the growing responsibilities and difficulties that come with the office. The interviewees were also asked what drives people away from populists and what factors limit support for them, e.g. in case populist sentiments might be more widespread, but electoral support for them is much lower. The predominant answer was that the incompetence of populists in terms of policies was the main factor for limiting their influence. One expert in populism from France, who is also a European expert in public affairs and media made a comparison to Brexit as \u201c the caricature of venting people\u2019s frustrations but having absolutely no answers on how to conduct things .\u201d The opinion is that they are successful at attracting support in the short term, but do not have a rational plan. As the \u201csymbolic\u201d issues override real interests, this puts them in a tough spot with regard to the electorate. Another problem perceived by an academic expert in populism is the leadership issue as leaders\u2019 egos present structural weaknesses for the populist parties. Similarly, an interviewee thought that the personal backgrounds of some populists are at odds with their public image as they are not one of the people as they present themselves. A participant in the focus group pointed out that the history of radical right parties prevented them from voting for them (implying extremist behaviour), even though some of their points could be agreed with and added that there was a similar experience with La France Insoumise. In fact, the parallel with the experience between WWI and WWII in France was invoked in some of the interviews. The opinion of the participants in the interviews is that populists are very good at picking up topics and framing the debate, but are not good at proposing answers . Populists\u2019 speeches are based on isolated factual assessments that can be shared by everyone, but they don\u2019t develop argumentation or deepen understanding. Interviewees consider that \u201cpopulists \u201ccultivate fear and anxiety\u2026 and are focused on the issues that people get worried about and nurture these fears\u201d. ",
        "77 The interviews of political science experts and CSO activists in France indicated that traditional parties have a \u201chuge responsibility\u201d for the rise of populism, which was also defined by expert in populism with knowledge on populism in Europe as a whole. They consider that they don\u2019t invest in new ideas, play it safe and are \u201cshallow in their ability to think\u201d, so they open opportunities for the populist parties. According to a focus group participant in Dr\u00f4me, \u201c There was an absence of attentiveness, of listening, a breach with people\u201d . Another participant thought that an important aspect of this problem is that mainstream politicians adopt the language of extremist parties. Equally important, though, is that it is considered that mainstream politicians have acquiesced in the face of populists as they don\u2019t have the courage to oppose them. 6.5.2. Related aspects: direct democracy, online disinformation and Euroscepticism The concept of direct democracy almost unanimously produced negative reactions from political science experts and CSO activists \u2013 \u201c referendums are a bit dangerous \u201d, as one participant in the Dr\u00f4me focus group put it \u2013 but with caveats. In one opinion, it is a good idea, but a double-edged sword. The problem is, especially with referenda, that they introduce distrust towards political representatives, imply that elected officials cannot be relied upon and could be bypassed and that legitimacy can only stem directly from the people. That is, populists and other parties, such as progressive left- wing parties, decided that referenda are a good idea, but it poured water into the mills of populists. One academic expert in populism with knowledge on European affairs considered that representative democracy is the opposite of direct democracy, saying that According to many political science experts and activists, however, there is a problem of participation that needs to be fixed, but direct democracy cannot work where it is not regularly practiced \u2013 e.g. France is not Switzerland. One academic expert in populism said that \u201cany direct democracy opportunity should be bolstered by an infrastructure of deliberation\u201d otherwise it would abandon the issue to populists . Interestingly, an academic expert in populism, who also an official proposed \u201ca democracy of proximity\u201d, \u201cactive subsidiarity\u201d consultations at appropriate levels \u2013 local, regional, national and European. \u201c populist parties pretend that they represent the people directly, whereas in fact, they only represent its moods, not its interests or its profoundness.\u201d ",
        "78 Online disinformation is seen as a substantial problem and closely related to populism. There was a clear connection between the collapse of traditional media and the rise of disinformation. It is interesting to note the reaction of a 16-year- old participant in the focus group in Dr\u00f4me, saying that (in regard to Facebook) \u201cwe don\u2019t know any more what is true or false... I think that all they say is gross, dangerous, it is sprawling, it takes huge proportions and it\u2019s shambolic\u201d and prefers to keep to the private sphere and avoid hazardous posts. Another participant said that he feels more optimistic for young people as they are acting more reasonably and responsibly with social media with this and know how to deal with online disinformation better than adults. There were examples of how it can be dealt with, such as with fact checking, analytical long pieces, discussions on media publications and programmes. Answers from the interviews underlined the close connection between populism and Euroscepticism . \u201c Populism feeds on Europhobia \u201d, considered one interviewee. One political science expert\u2019s explanation was that populists are strongly opposed to multilateralism, which the EU practices on a daily basis, so it is their main target. A number of interviewees mentioned the problem of politicians across the spectrum blaming the EU for failures and taking the credit for successes. At the same time, the interviewees showed honest and well-meaning criticism towards the European Union for a number of reasons. These include the distance between the EU and its citizens, the limitations of the European Commission stemming from it being too diplomatic and unable to defend itself, the extremely poor communication of EU achievements and funding that goes unnoticed. 6.5.3. Measures and levels of addressing the populist challenge Considering recommendations on what can be done, and at what level, to address the populist challenge, the interviewee offered a number of suggestions. At EU level , a key recommendation is to improve communication, as \u201c there is a consensus to say that the EU institutions\u2019 communication is the worst that can be done\u201d, as specified by an academic expert on populism with deep knowledge on European public affairs. There were examples of Europe Direct centres moving away from rural areas, where they are needed the most, to the biggest urban centres, and that the \u201cEU dialogues\u201d are not an appropriate name as there is not really any feedback to Commissioners. There was also criticism that the European Commission and its national representations were really not interested in supporting CSOs in communicating, for example, the 2019 European Parliament elections. ",
        "79 With regard to the role of the European Parliament, there were two important aspects to it. First, it is underrated in national politics by traditional parties and there is low turnout for the elections, thus benefitting populists who turn up in larger numbers and win. The other important point was that the European Parliament defends the values of the EU and its statements are important. There were suggestions for practical approaches, linking the EU with the regional level, such as easing access and transport in border areas and expanding Erasmus as one of the best EU programmes. In terms of a general strategy, there were two valuable points. First, the interviewees highlighted the communication skills of populists and their intuition for making politics, but also said they are poorly equipped for policies and lacking in substance . At the same time, one academic expert in populism offered a valuable piece of advice \u2013 \u201c we need rationality, in terms of expertise of public policies, etc., but we also need discourses on emotion \u201d, not undertaking purely technocratic approaches. Another answer reminded that it is not enough simply to denounce populism without providing answers to the questions, such as in the case of anti-racist programmes, and it can, in fact, be counter- productive. A recommendation for France, but drawing on Denmark\u2019s experience, as identified by an experienced observer of French and European affairs interviewed for the study, pointed to the success of The Alternative party as a method or template: \u201c\u2026 they had hundreds of meetings on the ground, letting people express what they wanted, and this ended up in a manifesto which had some surprising elements, not resembling traditional parties. And it is a serious approach, with an insistence on the effectiveness of policies \u201d. ",
        "80 6.5.4. Populism, impediments to CSOs and civil society responses When asked about impediments to their work, CSOs and activists in France pointed out that they don\u2019t experience any pressure due to legal changes to limit CSOs (unlike Hungary and Poland, mentioned by four different interviewees - academic experts in populism and CSO representative from the region - in France as negative examples 109 ). Concerning pressure from populists or negative campaigning , it was noted that a smaller populist party, UPR (Union Populaire R\u00e9publicaine), harassed activists online and elsewhere, but the bigger populist FN party did not bother them. Impediments to the work of CSOs in France included, most of all, a lack of finances and human resources, making it difficult to expand networks or continue operations. Despite the considerable number of CSOs and political science experts interviewed, in addition to the active participants in the focus group in France, who formulated numerous astute observations and proposals for actions, there are few CSO- specific insights and recommendations. The interviewees ascertained there are not enough relevant CSOs to tackle populism in either Aisne or Dr\u00f4me . For example, a European youth organisation said that they do not have local sections in any of the two regions with the possible explanation that they are rural areas, while such organisations \u2013 youth or European \u2013 are established, as a rule, in urban areas. The fact that in the French regions in focus there are relatively few CSOs with the relevant profile compared to the other countries was also attested by the active desktop research to identify CSOs potentially relevant to tackling populism (i.e. 0.12% and 0.19% for the two regions in France compared to 0.47% and 0.95% for the Italian regions). As a consequence, many of the recommendations for civic activities in the regions were envisioned by the respondents as relevant for local authorities. A CSO activist from the region in Aisne remarked that \u201c Unfortunately \u2026 Aisne is a bit of a desert in terms of European information and of fight against Euroscepticism and populist parties .\u201d Moreover, a regional official with knowledge on civil society and populism in the country official summarised the general state of civil society vis-\u00e0-vis populism as \u201c still very limited today, very weak, in comparison to the populist wave \u201d. 109 The respondents \u2013 political science experts and civic activists \u2013 mentioned Hungary and Poland for crackdowns on CSOs, the judiciary and institutions of democracy in general. In the case of the legislation to limit CSOs, the references were to problems reported in the international press: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban- ngos/civil-organizations-in-hungary-brace-for-government- crackdown-on-ngos-idUSKBN1HW1ZN or https://www.politico.eu/article/pis-polish-ngos-fear-the- governments-embrace/ ",
        "81 With regard to necessary resources , a CSO activist prioritised three aspects: financial and human resources as well as \u201ccommunication\u201d in the broader sense. For example, the focus group in Dr\u00f4me mentioned a lack of funding as a reason for the otherwise very useful \u201cr\u00e9gie de quartier\u201d (a type of neighbourhood associational structure) that could play a civil society role. The interviewees underlined that while financial resources are a prerequisite to take effective actions, the communication needs are much wider and go beyond the financial means \u2013 for example, \u201cscientific studies\u201d were mentioned among necessary resources, including on migration, to help tackle misconceptions. The resource needs listed implied skills building , acquiring more knowledge and collaboration between the different actors in the field, such as a platform to develop cooperation and networks. Among them are Europe House in Aisne tackling Euroscepticism and raising awareness about the EU, the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism, Romans Citoyennes, which helps citizens participate at town level, Action Citoyenne, which focuses on empowering citizen voices, ADOS (Ard\u00e8che-Dr\u00f4me- Ourosogui-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal) and Group local de la Cimade working on international development and migrant integration. A number of activities were mentioned \u2013 in France , in general, and the two regions \u2013 for tackling populism: interventions in schools, conferences and debates with MEPs, campaigns (e.g. \u201cL\u2019Europe en mieux\u201d, or \u201c Better Europe \u201d\u201d 110 ), conferences, debate-cafes, awareness- raising activities in different regions of 110 https://www.uef.fr/europe-en-mieux/ France with the aim to reach other territories than big cities only, workshops and training on countering disinformation, and citizen consultations targeting different audiences and subjects. Civic activists identified tackling disinformation and the distance between the institutions and citizens as the most important actions to counter populism. These require education and awareness- raising activities, not only theoretical, but also practical, in order to enable citizens to \u201cregain their citizenship\u201d. Education on \u201ccitizenship\u201d, for example, was emphasised in several interviews as a necessary CSO activity. In regard to the level of action, the interviewees recommended more activities at municipal level and in cooperation with municipal authorities. Another key topic identified for education activities was the role of European institutions and the functioning of the EU, also to be tackled at local level and in cooperation with cross- border authorities in order to bring communities from different countries together and convince them of the practical benefits of the EU. ",
        "82 CSOs working on migration and international development proposed more concrete actions to tackle prejudices, such as through personal stories of migrants and refugees, to alter public opinion, and more fact- based approaches to deal with disinformation and negative campaigning. CSO political science experts and activists mentioned a variety of measures that could be undertaken, such as the organisation of round tables, information campaigns, citizen debates and the popularisation in the media of the experiences of active solidarity (e.g. an emphasis on communication). Culture and sports, closely related to education , emerged from an interview as well as the focus group in Dr\u00f4me as potentially very important areas for CSO activities in tackling the negative aspects of populism: Both the interviews and focus group in France clearly identified the need for debates and recommended restoring active debates in society , either in clubs or neighbourhood associations. A focus group participant in Dr\u00f4me pointed to a format of consultations at local level, combined with education \u2013 \u201cLa Turbine \u00e0 Graines\u201d (\u201cThe Seeds Turbine\u201d) \u2013 \u201callowing citizens to express and transfer their ideas and demands to the city council\u201d. These recommendations are related to education \u2013 popular education \u2013 implying elements to serve as prevention, as well as \u201cdeveloping education, culture and social mix\u201d to establish mechanisms of working together. It is worth noting the suggestion through education and debates to revive awareness and interest in citizenship, politics and institutions, in the public sphere. On online disinformation, an example of an online publication (Le Taurillon) was provided making an offline version to reach people, who would otherwise not seek to be informed. There was an interesting note regarding scepticism of the role of the media as a potential ally, with the possible exception of local media or alternative media, which might be more supportive. \u201c Through sport, we allow for a citizen dynamic through integration and insertion. And also through culture, a lot of associations fighting against discrimination or for gender equality, for example, do a daily work of awareness and explanation. And this goes against the populist movements. \u201d ",
        "83 6.6. Conclusions and recommendations for France 6.6.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level In France, cultural factors are seen as potentially stronger in driving populism than socioeconomic factors at national level, although both sets of factors are closely linked. Socioeconomic factors might not cause populism directly, but rather lead to fears about job security, income and life prospects. In terms of identity, the rejection of multiculturalism and migrants also plays a considerable role. There are regional differences in the impact of the different factors. For Aisne, in the north of the country, this was job losses linked to deindustrialisation as a result of globalisation, while in Dr\u00f4me it was more job insecurity, fear of poverty and potential competition for jobs with migrants. The feeling of abandonment by the state and loss of control, the perceived distance between political elites and the people and, especially, the cleavage between the centre and the peripheral parts of the country play a significant and specific role in France. There is likely a difference in factors of populism between social groups . Cultural factors have a bigger role for the wealthier due to \u201ccultural anxiety\u201d from a loss of culture, while among the less wealthy the stronger factor is the anxiety of job losses and lower incomes. The rise of far- right and far-left populism was attributed to different factors, too, with the far-right playing on feelings of insecurity and the far-left on the problems of economic liberalism. The current phenomenon of the \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d (yellow jackets) protests around France is viewed as an expression of a variety of multifaceted frustrations and demands that have been voiced through the years, but have not been taken into account. Traditional parties are also considered to have a responsibility for the rise of populism as they play it safe, don\u2019t have the courage to oppose populists and are inattentive to the public concerns thus opening opportunities for the populist parties; they also tend to adopt the language of extremist parties, worsening the situation. ",
        "84 There is a problem of participation that needs to be addressed, but direct democracy is viewed rather as part of the problem. It is not opposed on principle, but it can easily be exploited by populists and indicate emotions rather than rational reasons. Direct democracy demands a number of preconditions, such as an \u201cinfrastructure of deliberation\u201d. A \u201cdemocracy of proximity\u201d, \u201cactive subsidiarity\u201d with robust consultation processes at regional, national and European level, was suggested as an alternative. There is a clear link between online disinformation and populism, especially after the collapse of traditional media. Fact-checking, analytical long pieces, discussions on media publications and programmes were deemed part of the solution. Young people were seen as better equipped to deal with online disinformation than adults. The close connection between populism and Euroscepticism was summarised by the statement that \u201cPopulism feeds on Europhobia\u201d. Populists are strongly opposed to multilateralism, which the EU practices on a daily basis, so it is their main target. However, both populist and mainstream politicians contribute to Euroscepticism as they blame the EU for failures and take credit for successes. 6.6.2. Conclusions regarding the role of civil society organisations France has a strong social sector, including in Dr\u00f4me and Aisne, in which most CSO employees are concentrated. There are organisations in both regions providing for the needs of minorities and migrants, including asylum seekers and refugees. The other organisations are mainly reliant on volunteers. CSO activity is much more promising in terms of facilitating direct democracy and countering online disinformation, while Euroscepticism is not specifically addressed. The mapping of the CSOs active in the areas of promoting EU values, civic education and engagement, civic liberties, direct democracy, support to minorities, refugees and migrants and tackling online disinformation, which was conducted in the regions based on official information sources 111 , reveals a marginal number of CSOs implementing activities that can potentially tackle populism. It represents the lowest percentage of all registered organisations compared to Austria, Italy and Poland. 111 The sources for the data for France are http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/, https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire- national-des-associations/ ",

In the Dr\u00f4me region of France, there are an estimated 15,181 CSOs in total, of which 0.12%, or 18, were deemed to carry out potentially relevant activities: 3 working on European values, 1 on civic education and engagement, a majority \u2013 9 \u2013 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism, and 8 on direct democracy and participation. In Aisne, out of the 10,261 CSOs, about 0.19%, or 19, were deemed to be potentially relevant: 2 working on EU values, 4 on civic education and engagement, 8 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism and 7 on direct democracy and participation. The finding that there are not enough relevant CSOs to tackle populism in either Aisne or Dr\u00f4me was confirmed by the interviews and the focus group. As one CSO activist interviewed observed, \u201cAisne is a bit of a desert in terms of European information (the Europe Direct Centre of Laon has closed, for example) and the fight against Euroscepticism and populist parties\u201d. A prominent pro-European CSO in France described the challenge that leads to the isolation of rural areas as \u201ca bit of a vicious circle: we don\u2019t manage to establish there, so there are no actions, so this contributes even more to the distancing of rural areas\u2019 inhabitants from European citizenship and thematics\u201d. Additional impediments to CSO activities in countering the populist challenge include limited financial and human resources as well as a lack of \u201ccommunication\u201d skills in the broader sense. Particularly in Aisne, funding issues are apparent. With the decision of the local council to withdraw funding to CSOs in Aisne, which is much poorer and with much lower social benefit expenditure than Dr\u00f4me, the factors behind the populist vote there could become even more acute. The lack of resources includes knowledge and skills and platforms for networking and collaboration. ",
        "86 6.6.3. Recommendations 1 Traditional parties have a responsibility to innovate and confront populists , instead of \u201cplaying it safe\u201d. 2 Infrastructure for citizens\u2019 deliberation, to solicit the opinions of people and address calls for more direct democracy should be created. 3 EU communications must improve, especially in rural areas, regarding its achievements and funding. 4 Civic education, culture and sports should be fostered. 5 Disinformation and the distance between citizens and institutions needs to be tackled. 6 Active debates in society through local clubs and neighbouring associations should be restored. 7 There needs to be investment in CSOs in rural areas, in their human resources, communication skills and knowledge base . 8 Collaboration between different actors to tackle populism should be fostered. 9 Prejudices in society can be addressed through the personal stories of migrants and refugees. ",
        "87 7. The case of Italy: populism, citizens and CSOs 7.1. The rise of populism and populist parties in Italy In Italy, the roots of populism go back to the political corruption scandals of the 1990s, which discredited Italy\u2019s mainstream parties 112 . Silvio Berlusconi was the chief beneficiary of this, dominating Italian politics between 1994 and 2011 through his personal parties \u2013 Forza Italia (FI) and Popolo della Libert\u00e0 (PdL) \u2013 presenting himself as a saviour on a mission to \u201crestore sovereignty and prosperity to a \u2018people\u2019 cast as victims of a series of elites and faced with a multi-faceted and ongoing situation of crisis\u201d. 113 The literature is split on whether FI can be defined as populist, but that depends on the framework of populism used and whether the populist discourse of Silvio Berlusconi, the dominant figure and President of FI, can be separated from the party itself 114 . In the Populism Index of this study (see Table 13 ), FI scores relatively low on anti- elitism (4.32) and Euroscepticism(4.27), higher on majoritarianism (6.06) and highest on monoculturalism (7.25) and authoritarianism (7.66) on the scale from 0- 10, lowest to highest. This makes it the lowest scoring party among those considered populist in Italy. Since Berlusconi\u2019s resignation as prime minister in 2011 because of economic crisis and public debt, Berlusconi\u2019s star has waned, surpassed on the political right by his former coalition partner Lega Nord (LN) and Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S). This is what Christophe Bouillard 115 calls the \u201cthird wave of Italian populist upheaval\u201d, which is comparable in many ways to what happened in the years 2011-13 and 1991- 94, in which the established parties were seen to be corrupt and unable to reform Italy and anti-party parties mobilised to tap into anti-establishment sentiment using populist discourse. In the present wave of populism, M5S has led this mobilisation.

        "88 Table 13. Populism Index of selected parties in Italy Lega Nord (LN) is anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic, traditional and authoritarian, with a quasi-charismatic leadership and an aggressive attitude to national and supranational elites. 116 Their populism is strongly borne out by the CHES survey (please, see also Appendix 22 ), which shows them to be deeply populist on all measures. They represent positions that are anti-immigrant, nativist, nationalistic and Eurosceptic. 117 Their strong anti- immigrant message was taken into the 2018 general election, with Matteo Salvini pledging to deport 500,000 undocumented migrants within a year of taking power 118 . This message has been continued in government with policies to refuse entry into Italian ports for ships rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean and a proposal to clear Roma settlements 119 .

Outside of anti-elitism, Euroscepticism and direct democracy, there is little to distinguish them politically and they have what one political science expert has defined as a \u201cpost-ideological political ideology\u201d 121 . They have called for wage support for Italians, a minimum pension for all retirees, a lower retirement age and a universal basic income of at least EUR 780 a month. Forza Italia (FI) has been at the heart of Italian politics for over 20 years, so it would be difficult for Silvio Berlusconi and his party to maintain an anti-elitist discourse, but FI remains populist in its personalised and charismatic leadership. It is liberal or neoliberal populist, but illiberal towards democratic checks and balances. 122 Fratelli d\u2019Italia (FdI) is a nationalist, conservative and Eurosceptic party. They support the traditional Italian family, putting Italy and Italians first, strong anti- immigration measures, restrictive citizenship policies, protection of Italian identity and economic protectionism. They are a minor force in Italian politics. The regional trends in the populist vote in the case of the two regions in Italy \u2013 Udine and Reggio di Calabria, show there is a gradual trend upwards in populist support throughout the period of 2008-2018 (please, see the trends and comparison across all eight regions in the Appendix 3: The populist vote at regional level: an overview of trends across regions and time ). 7.2. Demographic indicators and the populist vote in Italy at national level The study also carried out an analysis of a number of demographic indicators \u2013 gender, age, education and employment \u2013 to examine their relationship with populist voting patterns at national level. 123 The analysis at national level is based on available public data and the analysis at regional level is based on the citizen surveys, conducted for the purposes of this study and provided below in this chapter and Appendix 5 . In terms of gender , during the 2018 general election the populist voting patterns of men and women were approximately the same, as illustrated in the Figure. 120 Il Programma per l'Italia Scritto Dagli Italiani, Movimento 5Stelle https://www.movimento5stelle.it/programma/index.html 121 As dubbed by Giannino, Domenico in \u201cFrom the Parole Guerriere to Electoral Success: Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement\u201d, Oxford Univerity Politics blog, 6 March 2018, https://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/parole-guerriere-electoral- success-italys-five-star-movement/ 122 Bobba, G., & McDonnell, D., \u201cItaly \u2013 A Strong and Enduring Market for Populism\u201d, 2015. 123 The study used national exit poll data, which provides an estimate as to the voting behaviour of particular demographic groups, to consider possible trends in voting patterns across these groups, both within individual countries and for particular parties. It allowed also for observations of any common features that hold across the countries studied. ",
        "90 In terms of age in the 2018 election, M5S were the most popular party amongst all age groups but with a slightly lower vote share in the over 65 group. Lega performed best among the 50-64 age group and worst among those over 65. Fratelli d\u2019Italia, the smallest party compared to the others, had its worst result among the youngest voters. With regard to education in the 2018 general election, exit polls suggested that, in general, those who had received more education were less likely to vote for populist parties. This trend is not entirely consistent, however, as those who received only an elementary school education were less likely to vote for a populist party than would otherwise be expected. When the data is broken down by party, a possible explanation for this pattern emerges: M5S appear to have been more popular with those who received more of their school education, although they were notably less popular with those who have achieved a university qualification. Those who received only an elementary school education also voted less frequently for Lega than those who have a middle school education. In fact, those with only an elementary school education voted more frequently for the centre-left coalition led by PD than their non-university-educated peers. The centre-left received 28.5% of the votes from this demographic, 18.4% from those who had achieved a middle school education, 20.3% amongst those who had a high school diploma, and 31.4% of votes cast by those with university degrees. Overall, populist voting behaviour by employment status did not seem to follow a clear trend in the 2018 general election. There is evidence that the unemployed, blue-collar workers, homemakers and self-employed people gave a higher proportion of their votes to populist parties. The picture is mixed though. The vote for M5S is consistently fairly high, but the party is notably less popular with retirees than the data regarding age suggests. Their share of the student vote is surprisingly low given their popularity with young people, but this could perhaps signal that their youth base consists of those in entry-level jobs. Lega seems to be particularly popular with blue-collar workers and the self-employed. ",
        "91 7.3. Citizen surveys in the Udine and Reggio di Calabria regions of Italy The citizen surveys, as the case with the other countries, were focused on eliciting the opinion of citizens specifically in the two regions in focus in Italy \u2013 Udine and Reggio di Calabria (abbreviated respectively as UD and RC). A total of 106 respondents 124 in Udine and 67 respondents 125 in Reggio di Calabria took part in the survey. The survey included 36 closed-ended questions and demographic information about the respondents for each of the two regions. It was carried out online on a voluntary basis. These are exploratory surveys meant to complement the other research methods as the samples are too small for a nationally representative study 126 . It should be noted that, in this case, the sample sizes in terms of age, gender, education, occupation, income, religious affiliation and political preference provide a good basis for the purposes of the study as there are respondents within all main demographic categories listed above (e.g. 32% male and 68% female respondents in Udine and 40% male and 60% female in Reggio di Calabria). As noted in the beginning of this report, the two regions were selected for their different socioeconomic characteristics and the level of the populist vote in the regions (please, see Appendix 21 ). The table below shows the main indicators. Udine, which is located in the north of the country, is the wealthier of the two with a GDP 103% of the EU28 average. Reggio di Calabria, which is in the south of Italy, has a GDP 62% of the EU28 average, which is considerably less than Udine. The two regions have similar population numbers. Table 14. Socio-economic characteristics of the two regions in Italy 124 In Udine, out of 90 respondents, who responded to the political affiliation question, 17.80% (16) marked Partito Democratico, 16.70% (15) Movimento 5 Stelle, 3.30% (3) Forza Italia, 15.60% (14) Lega, 23.30% (21) other parties, 6.70% (6) non-voters, 16.70% (15) preferred not to answer. 125 In Reggio Calabria, out of 65 respondents, who responded to the political affiliation question, 12.30% (8) marked Partito Democratico, 36.90% (24) Movimento 5 Stelle, 3.10% (2) Forza Italia, 7.70% (5) Lega, 16.90% (11) other parties, 9.20% (6) non-voters, 13.80% (9) preferred not to answer. The parties listed here, were included as answers in the questionnaires (Fratelli d'Italia is not included as it has lower election result). 126 A fully representative study would require a sample of some 380 people per each region.

        "92 The current analysis is based on select questions pertinent to the five dimensions of populism as identified in this study: anti- elite, majoritarian, authoritarian, monocultural and Eurosceptic, with an additional focus on issues such as direct democracy, disinformation and sovereignty. It is worth noting that, according to the citizen survey results below, there are differences in attitudes between the supporters of the two main populist parties in Italy \u2013 M5S and Lega \u2013 that are currently in government. The text below covers these two main parties since they achieved the highest election results as well as the highest representation in the citizen surveys, but there is futher information about the other parties, including the smaller populist parties, in the respective appendices on citizen surveys in Italy (Appendix 16. Party affiliation and key questions on populism in Italy and Appendix 17. Party supporters\u2019 profiles across demographic indicators at regional level in Italy ). In terms of gender , there are no substantial differences across the party preferences. In the case of both Udine and Reggio di Calabria, women were a slight majority in nearly all cases because more women participated in the surveys. Moreover an analysis of the socio- demographic characteristics of the respondents is provided based on the respective questions in the citizen survey. With regard to age , 56% of M5S and 43% of Lega supporters in Reggio di Calabria are younger \u2013 between 18-24 and 25-34 years old. The remaining M5S supporters are represented by all age groups and Lega by older respondents. In Udine, 60% of M5S and 72% of Lega supporters are up to 34 years old, and, for the rest, are represented by all age groups. Concerning education , about 70% of the both Lega and M5S respondents in Reggio di Calabria have a high school education, but the other M5S supporters in the region have a slightly higher education than the remaining Lega supporters \u2013 24% of M5S voters have a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree, while 28% of Lega\u2019s respondents listed \u201cother\u201d or \u201cother professional\u201d education. In Udine, M5S and Lega respondents have comparable levels of high school education \u2013 67% and 60% respectively \u2013 but there are differences among the rest. 27% of M5S respondents have bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees, or PhD, while the remaining Lega respondents in the region have 11% master\u2019s with the rest having either \u201cno education\u201d or \u201cother professional education\u201d. To sum up, it can be claimed that both M5S and Lega respondents in the survey have, on balance, lower levels of education compared to the other parties (PD, other small parties), with M5S supporters slightly better educated than those of Lega. ",
        "93 In terms of household income and party preferences in Reggio di Calabria, those within the lowest income bracket voted mostly for Lega (71%) and M5S (64%), but the situation in Udine is more diverse with about 47% in the lower income bracket voting for M5S. With regard to religion and party preferences in Reggio di Calabria, M5S supporters are most diverse \u2013 with 72% Catholic and small shares of Orthodox Christian, Protestant, Agnostic, Atheist and other. The highest share of Catholic supporters can be found among Lega voters (86%). After non-voters in Udine, M5S voters are most diverse (40% Catholic, 27% agnostic, 20% atheist and 7% Muslim). In terms of anti-elite attitudes , the majority of respondents in both Italian regions agree with the statement \u201cPoliticians are from a different socioeconomic class to other citizens\u201d, with 60% in Reggio di Calabria and 62% in Udine. Only about a fifth of respondents in the two regions disagree with this and a similar proportion is undecided. Supporters of the ruling M5S party have the largest share of agreement in Reggio di Calabria (71%) and the lowest share of agreement is among Lega supporters (40%). In Udine, among the main populist parties, M5S supporters disagree with this notion to the highest extent (26%) compared to Lega voters (14%). In Udine, 60% of M5S supporters agree with this, which is equivalent to Lega respondents with 57% ( Appendix 16 , Figures 1 and 2 ). Figure 26. Anti-elite sentiments ",
        "94 With regard to majoritarianism and the statement \u201cthe government should be allowed to violate civil liberties when acting in the interest of the majority \u201d, the vast majority of Italian respondents in both regions disagree with it. Opposition to this is slightly higher in Udine (76%) than Reggio di Calabria (71%). The share of those agreeing with the notion is just 14% in Reggio di Calabria and 12% in Udine, with small numbers also undecided (15% and 13%, respectively). It is worth contrasting the high disagreement towards the proposition for curbing civil rights in the name of the majority (71-76%) with the level of support for a strong, unchecked leader at 41%-46% \u2013 i.e. there is no clear case of public support for authoritarian and majoritarian positions. On the issue of government breaching civil liberties for the sake of the majority, in Reggio di Calabria, Lega respondents are among those agreeing most (20%), but M5S supporters oppose it to a very large extent (79%). In Udine, it is opposed in the highest measure by M5S voters (80%). The least opposed are the non-voters (50%) and Lega supporters (58%) ( Appendix 16 , Figures 7 and 8 ). Figure 27. Government and civil liberties With regard to authoritarianism and the proposal for a strong leader, unchecked by courts or parliament , there are again regional differences. 41% of respondents in Reggio di Calabria either agree or strongly agree, with a slightly higher share (46%) disagreeing. In Udine, around a third (30%) support the proposition, but twice as many (59%) reject it. In both cases, the share of undecided respondents is low \u2013 11-12%. In Reggio di Calabria, supporters of the main populist parties are equally split on the issue \u2013 40% from Lega agree and 40% disagree, while within M5S 42% agree and 46% disagree. In Udine, support for a strong leader is highest among Lega voters (79%) and lowest among M5S supporters (14%). The most disagreement comes from within M5S (80%). ( Appendix 16 , Figures 5 and 6 ). ",
        "95 Figure 28. Strong, unchecked leader On the issue of direct democracy , there are regional differences. In Reggio di Calabria, the less wealthy of the two regions, more than 71% support direct referenda, while in Udine, the better-off region, only 46% support them. Support for more direct democracy is even more categorical in Reggio di Calabria, considering that only 10% are undecided and just 18% oppose the proposition. In Udine, there is much less support and a higher rejection of direct referenda. There, less than half of respondents (46%) agree with this, over a third (34%) disagree and one fifth are undecided. In Reggio di Calabria, direct referenda are most popular among non-voters and the populist Lega supporters with close to 100% and the lowest is 88% for M5S. In the Udine region, direct referenda are preferred most of all by Lega (71%), and M5S (60%) respondents. ( Appendix 16 , Figures 3 and 4 ). Figure 29. Direct referenda ",
        "96 In terms of attitudes towards migrants , respondents in the northern and well-off region of Udine are more inclined to recognise the economic benefits of migration (35%) compared to less than half in Reggio di Calabria (15%). 51% in Reggio di Calabria disagree with this compared to 38% in Udine. About a fifth of respondents in both regions are undecided. In Reggio di Calabria, the highest degree of disagreement can be found among Lega supporters (80%). Half of M5S voters are undecided, which is a large proportion. In Udine, opposition is higher among Lega supporters (71%) than M5S (47%). ( Appendix 16 , Figures 9 and 10 ). Figure 30. Economic impact of migrants As there are regional differences, additional questions on the topic were used to explore these differences. 127 With regard to the question of whether migration enriches cultural life , there is strong agreement about this notion in both regions, although agreement is smaller in Reggio di Calabria \u2013 53%, compared to 61% in Udine. About a fifth of respondents in each region disagree with this \u2013 24% in Reggio di Calabria and 19% in Udine. 127 The citizen survey includes 36 questions with two or three questions on some of the topics. The current report uses the main questions, but in case the analysis necessitates it \u2013 e.g. there are regional differences, the additional questions and responses are used. ",
        "97 Figure 31. Migration and cultural life Concerning EU membership , there are again regional differences. Respondents in Udine show higher support for Italy\u2019s EU membership (67%) than Reggio di Calabria (46%). Almost a third of respondents (28%) in Reggio di Calabria are opposed to EU membership, compared to just 18% in Udine. The share of undecided respondents is much higher in Reggio di Calabria (25%) than in Udine (16%). In Reggio di Calabria, M5S voters expressed relatively high agreement with this (44%) while Lega supporters disagreed with EU membership to the highest extent (50%). In Udine, 60% of M5S supporters agree with this, but Lega supporters disagree most (33%), with a high share of undecided respondents (42%) ( Appendix 16 , Figures 13 and 14 ). ",

        "99 Figure 32. EU membership The vast majority of Udine\u2019s respondents (65%) disagree with the proposal that Italy\u2019s economy would be better off outside of the EU . In comparison, the share in Reggio di Calabria is 51% \u2013 still a majority, but lower than in Udine. The share of those unsure about the economic value of EU membership in Reggio di Calabria (25%) is more than twice that of Udine (12%). 128 128 The citizen surveys included 36 a closed-ended questions along eight dimensions with key questions. The analysis as a rule uses eight key questions on the dimensions of populism include anti-elitist sentiments, authoritarian and majoritarian tendencies, attitudes towards migration, religion as a marker of national identity, opinion about EU membership and the sovereignty debate in the context if EU membership, and the rest are used only if deemed necessary for clarification. ",
        "100 With regard to the sovereignty debate , there are again markedly different regional perspectives. Respondents from Reggio di Calabria are much more inclined to agree that the EU should return powers to the national government (over half, or 62%) compared to Udine (42%). Undecided respondents in both regions are about a fifth (21%). In Udine, twice as many (38%) disagree with the proposition than in Reggio di Calabria (18%). In Reggio di Calabria, the highest support for the proposal comes from those who refused to identify political affiliation (78%), followed by M5S (74%) and other, smaller parties (44%). In Udine, the strongest support for the return of EU powers to the national government is among M5S supporters (73%), as well as Lega voters (67%) and non-voters (50%) ( Appendix 16 , Figures 15 and 16 ). Figure 34. EU and national government powers It is worth noting that there are virtually no differences between the two regions in the perception how the EU is treating Italian citizens . An estimate of 13% and 14%, respectively, in Reggio di Calabria and Udine agree that the EU is sensitive to concerns of Italians, 32% in each region are undecided and 55% and 54% disagree with this in Reggio di Calabria and Udine, respectively. ",
        "101 There are regional differences in attitudes towards traditional values . The share of those for whom traditional values are personally important is 71% in Reggio di Calabria and 51% in Udine, with smaller numbers for whom they are not important \u2013 11% in Reggio di Calabria and 15% in Udine. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the latter, with more than a third of respondents (34%) unsure. Figure 36. Importance of traditions It is interesting, however, to note that the difference between the two regions is smaller on the question of whether Christianity/Catholicism is an essential aspect of Italian identity than on the importance traditional values. Just 13% in Reggio di Calabria and 11% in Udine agree that Christianity/Catholicism is essential to national identity, whilst 68% and 78% disagree with this in Reggio di Calabria and Udine, respectively. In Reggio di Calabria, 60% of Lega voters support this proposition, but very high proportion of the M5S voters (71%) disagree. In Udine, 21% of Lega supporters agree with the proposition, but 73% of M5S supporters disagree ( Appendix 16 , Figures 11 and 12 ). Figure 37. Christianity and national identity ",
        "102 A summary of the positions across political affiliation shows several observations. With regard to anti-elitism , there are regional and party differences as in Reggio di Calabria, supporters of smaller (\u201cOther\u201d) parties and those of the ruling M5S party have the largest share of agreement, but low support within the populist Lega and non-affiliated. In Udine, non-affiliated and FI voters agree most and among the populist parties, M5S voters are less anti- elitist than those of Lega. With regard to direct referenda , in both regions the populist Lega and M5S voters as well as those of FI are the biggest supporters of the idea and it is opposed most by the voters of the non-populist PD. Support for a strong, unchecked leader , there are regional and party differences as in RC it is strong also among voters of the non-populist PD party and the populist Lega, but in Udine it is rejected by them and the populist M5S, the non-affiliated and FI voters and supported by the Lega (with FI voters somewhat divided). With regard to \u201cmajoritarianism \u201d , there are some regional differences and similarities, as those opposed in both regions are M5S and smaller parties, in addition to non-affiliated and non-voters in RC and PD voters in UD. FI and Lega either agree (in RC region) or are least opposed (Lega in UD). In regard to economic benefits of migration , there are regional similarities as in both regions non-voters, unaffiliated and Lega tend to disagree most and smaller parties and PD voters support migration. FI voters show different preferences \u2013 support in RC and disapproval in UD. There are high shares of undecided among smaller parties and especially PD and M5S voters (nearly half of them). On the issue of religion and national identity , in both regions the Lega voters agree with this notion, and the populist M5S, the non- populist PD, non-voters, smaller parties and unaffiliated generally disagree with this. In terms of EU membership , the populist Lega supporters reject it in the highest extent in both regions, but Lega has also high shares of undecided among them \u2013 as many other groups such as smaller parties, FI, PD and the populist M5S. Generally, PD voters, FI, M5S, smaller parties, non- voters, unaffiliated have higher shares of support to EU membership. With regard to the question of sovereignty , the populist M5S voters in both regions show a high level of support to EU returning powers to the national government. Depending on the region, there is high support to this proposition among unaffiliated and smaller parties voters (in RC) as well as the populist Lega, non-voters and FI supporters (UD). While there are many similarities between the two regions, there are marked differences on key questions. For example, respondents from Reggio di Calabria are much more inclined to support direct democracy (RC 71%; 46% UD), reject authoritarian proposals for a strong leader, unchecked by the parliament and courts, to a lesser extent (RC 46% - 59% UD) and agree less that migration brings economic benefits (RC 15%; 35% UD). They are less supportive of EU membership (RC 46%; 67% UD), fewer disagree that Italy\u2019s economy would be better off outside the EU (RC 51%; 65% UD) and more consider that the EU should return powers to the national government (RC 62%; 42% UD). That is, respondents from Reggio di Calabria tend to support populist positions to a greater extent. ",
        "103 With regard to similarities, respondents in both regions have similar views on politicians and citizens being from different socioeconomic classes (RC 60%; 62% UD), reject breaching civil liberties for the benefit of the majority (12% UD; 14% RC) and attach less importance to religion as a marker of national identity (RC 13%; 11% UD). However, respondents from Reggio di Calabria put more emphasis on traditional values than those in Udine (RC 71%; 51% UD). The comparison between the eight regions in focus (the two regions in Italy and the other six in the rest of the countries) in this study across eight key questions of the citizen surveys 129 can be seen in the Appendix 6: Comparison across the eight regions in focus . 7.4. CSO environment and CSOs at regional level in Italy This section analyses the state of civil society organisations at regional level in Italy and assesses their potential role in tackling populism. 130 131 132 The CSO environment in Italy deteriorated from 2008 to 2017 , according to the V-Dem Core Civil Society Index (see Appendix 8: V-Dem Core Civil Society Index ) as its score fell by 6.2% between 2008 and 2017 133 , compared to falls of 1.6% in Austria, 6.5% in France and 27.3% in Poland. 129 The citizen surveys were conducted in all eight regions in focus for the purposes of this study, using a closed-ended questionnaire.

These key questions on the dimensions of populism include anti-elitist sentiments, authoritarian and majoritarian tendencies, attitudes towards migration, religion as a marker of national identity, opinion about EU membership and the sovereignty debate in the context if EU membership. 130 The sources on Italy include: https://www.istat.it/it/files//2017/12/Nota-stampa-censimento-non-profit.pdf https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/207807 https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/207807 https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/207807 http://www.comune.udine.gov.it/servizi-online/ascolto-attivo http://www.reggiocal.it/on-line/Home/AreeTematiche/AssembleaPubblica.html http://www.reggiocal.it/on-line/Home/AreeTematiche/SpazioGiovani/articolo109549.html http://www.auserfriuli.it/index.php 131 The section reviews the current and potential role of CSOs in countering populism and the populist narratives in view of socioeconomic factors, migration, direct democracy, Euroscepticism, EU values, civic education and the use of online disinformation. It examines the environment in which CSOs operate, the typology of CSOs at regional level and the activities CSOs undertake to address populism. There are examples of CSOs\u2019 initiatives, but the good practices identified to highlight the positive impact CSOs can have are presented elsewhere in this report. There is a short overview of the situation at national level (see Appendix 15: CSO typologies and developments on national level in Italy for more information about CSOs at national level). This section is based on data from publicly available records and sources and the CSO interviews conducted especially for this study are presented separately. 132 It should be emphasised that there were vast differences in the available information between the different countries and the different regions within the same country, with definitions and data varying substantially even within a single country or region. The analysis took these circumstances into account and standardised the information to the extent possible; nevertheless, it necessarily imposed differences in these sections of the report between the countries and regions. 133 The civil society score of Italy fell from 0.964 in 2008 to 0.904 in 2017 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0=fragile, 1=robust. For the other countries, please see the respective country sections. ",
        "104 The study used the data available on Regione Autonoma Friuli-Venezia Giulia as the most relevant source on civil society in Udine . When the Regione figures are taken into account, Udine has an estimated 4,494 CSOs, out of which 91% are associations, 2% social cooperatives, 1% foundations and 6% with another legal basis. CSOs in the culture, sport and recreation sectors are the most prevalent, with 70.45% of organisations, and the next highest is social assistance and civil protection, with only 7.3%. The vast majority of organisations has no employees . Of the 12% of organisations that do have paid employees, 5.3% have 1-2 employees and 4.27% have 3-9 employees. Only 0.4% have 50 or more employees and 0.66% 20-49 employees, meaning that small volunteer organisations are very much the norm in the region. The number of employees in Udine is about 7,500 and the number of volunteers 74,000, with 67% of employees working for social cooperatives and 92% of volunteers for associations. This is generally the case across all sectors, although employees are concentrated in the social assistance and civil protection, education and economic development and social cohesion sectors, with 55.2%, 14.24% and 14.03% respectively. The majority of employees are in the social assistance and civil protection and economic development and social cohesion sectors, suggesting that there are large, professional organisations working in these areas. Indeed, 29 organisations in Friuli-Venezia Giulia are responsible for around 52% of the paid workforce. Volunteers, on the other hand, are largely active in culture, sport and recreation organisations, which account for 68.5% of the total, although more than 11% volunteer in the social sector. For Reggio di Calabria , as with Udine, the most complete data is available at Regione level. Based on this data, there are an estimated 2,433 in the region, with 87% associations, 7% social cooperatives, 1% foundations and 4% with another legal basis. Culture, sport and recreation organisations are again the most common, making up 59% of the total, with social assistance and civil protection organisations the next highest with 10.5%, which may reflect the greater need for social assistance in Reggio di Calabria than in Udine. In Reggio di Calabria, as with Udine, only a small percentage of organisations have employees , although the percentage is higher in Reggio di Calabria. Of the 18% of organisations with employees, 8.7% have only 1-2 employees and 6.45% have 3-9 employees. Only 0.29% have more than 50 employees and 0.58% 20-49 employees, meaning that small volunteer organisations, as with Udine, are typical. The number of employees in the region is about 3,000 and volunteers 27,500. Employees are concentrated in social cooperatives, which account for 48% of the total, but to a lesser extent than in Udine, whilst 93% of volunteers work for associations. There is more of an even distribution of employees across different activities than in Udine, with 30.5% in the social sector, 20.2% in education, 17% in health and 16.8% in economic development and social cohesion, and the workforce is spread across organisations of different size. Volunteers are mostly found in the culture, sport and recreation sector, with 49% of the total, but there is a large proportion in both social assistance and civil protection and health, which account for 23% and 11% respectively. ",
        "105 With regard to tackling socioeconomic problems , the social sectors in both regions are strong, with larger more professional organisations dominating, compared to the small, largely volunteer organisations in other areas of activity, and the sectors are rich in organisations addressing poverty, social development, marginalisation, discrimination and issues around asylum, refugees, migrants, minorities and community relations. Despite the fact that it has a smaller overall number of CSOs, the number operating in this field is larger in Reggio di Calabria than in Udine. Concerning the populist anti-migrant narrative , OIKOS ONLUS 134 , an organisation based in the Udine region that is active in the reception, protection and integration of foreign citizens in Italy, highlighted the difficulties populism causes for organisations working with migrants, including xenophobia, hostility towards NGOs operating reception centres, diminishing funds and propaganda against those who believe in solidarity and acceptance. Explaining the complexity of migration, according to OIKOS, especially in the toxic environment of social media, is a major concern, as is a lack of regional policies addressing migration. With regard to direct democracy and related activities, there are mechanisms in place in Udine and Reggio di Calabria for citizen participation and engagement, though little provision for direct democracy. The administrations of both Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Province of Udine provide information about transparent government 139 The CSO participated in an interview for this study, which is documented. and consultations are held at comune level. In Reggio di Calabria, public assemblies are held at which all citizens over the age of 16 can participate alongside decision- makers. The last one took place on 9 March 2018 on the subject of \u201cwhat has changed in the last two years in transparency, legality and participation?\u201d There is also a Permanent Commission for Youth Policies, which enables young people in the region to submit suggestions, proposals and ideas on issues that affect them. The only organisation identified in Udine that is active in this area is AUSER RisorsAnziani, which is a national voluntary association. One of its aims is to promote active citizenship through the responsible participation of people in the life and services of the local community, but their specific activities are not clear. The problem of online disinformation has been addressed in Italy by legislation to criminalise the sharing of disinformation, an online portal for citizens to report disinformation to the Polizia Postale and a national \u201cTen Commandments\u201d for spotting disinformation, which was rolled out in 8,000 schools across Italy in 2017. At a local level, Media Educazione Comunita, based in Udine, promotes critical awareness of the media. It held a number of events in Udine schools for the 2018 Safer Internet Day, including on digital citizenship and civic awareness, works with schools to deliver a course on analysing the news and producing journalistic content, and is also working with schools on a digital citizenship and youth participation project that aims to promote the conscious and safe use of the internet, as well as social inclusion and active citizenship. ",
        "106 In Reggio di Calabria, the AICA Calabria Section promotes the dissemination of digital culture and skills in Calabria, in line with the European e-Competence Framework. In order to tackle Euroscepticism at regional level, Casa per l\u2019Europa and Accademia Europeista actively promote EU values and awareness of the EU in Udine and work closely with young people. Casa per l\u2019Europa aims to promote values of pluralism, peace and cooperation and to establish a civil European conscience, providing information and outreach to the community. Accademia Europeista is a student exchange organisation that seeks to spread the values and opportunities of the EU to a wider audience. It organises activities, events and visits in the region. In Reggio di Calabria, Agenzia di Promozione Integrata per i Cittadini in Europa (APICE) promotes a common European culture through awareness-raising activities and the promotion of the fundamental values of the EU. 7.5. Findings of the expert and CSO interviews This section presents the findings of the expert and CSO interviews (see Appendix 4 on the questionnaire and Appendix 7 for a list of interviewed experts and CSO activists carried out in the two regions in focus in Italy . There are further conclusions, recommendations and cross-country comparisons in the concluding chapter of this report. The interviewees were based in the country and in the two regions in focus. Eleven in-depth interviews were conducted in total in regard to Italy with seven CSO activists, two political science experts and two officials, all with knowledge and opinions on the issues at hand. The answers are provided in a summarised form without referring to the names and positions of the respondents (a list of respondents is provided in the appendices). For the sake of the research, the opinions of CSO activists and experts are represented as provided in the interviews, but this should not be construed in any way as an endorsement of these views and recommendations by the research team. The questions asked about the causes of populism in Italy, national and regional differences and similarities, and specific aspects related to populism, such as Euroscepticism, online disinformation, direct democracy and the role of CSOs, including impediments and solutions. ",
        "107 7.5.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level With regard to the factors that drive populism , most interviewees pointed to a combination of socioeconomic and cultural factors, but with an emphasis on the socioeconomic factors. Based on the analysis of the information, it can be observed that it is, indeed, a case of interplay between the different factors, where socioeconomic factors create financial and job uncertainty, which is then blamed on factors such as migration, EU rules and other issues and exploited by populists. As one regional official, interviewed for this study, put it Two other academic experts in populism put a strong emphasis on the role of socioeconomic factors , namely austerity policies in recent years, for triggering the rise of populism, with one of them ranking the importance of factors as follows. First, there is the cultural factor of anti-party sentiment among the citizens; second, the economic crisis; third, the bipartisan government of the last two years. The crisis of political parties was important in this regard as people have lost trust in mainstream parties, with left and right being perceived as the same thing. Also, the factors for populism are different for different social groups \u2013 the lower income groups suffer from unemployment and economic uncertainty and the middle class is concerned about downgrading. It is important to note that \u2018populism\u2019 as a term is not very clear among the public, not used very much, conflated with other phenomena, such as racism and xenophobia, or used too broadly to apply to anything disliked \u2013 e.g. CSOs reported the term being applied to them. Some media distinguish between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d populism, again without clarity of usage, according to one CSO representative from the region of Reggio di Calabria. According to this CSO activist from Reggio Calabria, the lack of a clear and accepted definition at national and European level makes it very difficult to deal with populism. \u201c First, there is the crisis, leading to the population being scared of losing their living standards, their jobs and their level of income... Then, there are the migrants, who are seen as a threat and as a factor of closure. Finally, for the populists in general, the main philosophy is to have benefits, but without having to respect the requirements of external regulations or agreements .\u201d ",
        "108 Answers to the question of whether there are different factors at play in the different regions of the country deserve extra attention. The rise of populism and its manifestations are part of a single national phenomenon but, according to the interviewed, there are regional differences that play a significant role. The main conclusion that emerged from the interviews of political science experts and CSOs was about the regional differences in Italy between the North and the South regarding the differences in the drivers behind populism, political choices and different \u201ctypes of populism\u201d and their manifestations. As one interviewed regional official opined, \u201c...in these two different parts of Italy, with different concerns, you also have two different tendencies to vote, two different populisms.\u201d One academic expert on populism said that the strongest factor in the North is anxiety about losing safety, security, income and living standards, while in the South it is more about social benefits and increasing incomes. That is, in the South, the strongest factor is socioeconomic , connected to the underdevelopment of the region and the expectations of citizens that the government will intervene to solve these needs, thus opening easy opportunities for populist promises. The ensuing xenophobia and racism in the South is, therefore, linked to competition for resources with migrants, refugees and foreigners. In the North, one interviewee identified more straightforward xenophobia and racism as personal convictions. According to political science experts interviewed, the different factors conditioned the different political choices when voting. This has led to support for Lega Nord in the North and M5S in the South with their different agendas \u2013 e.g. income and security from Lega and the promise of a universal basic income from M5S. As one academic expert in populism defined it \u201c the two populist parties of Italy succeeded in both parts of Italy: the Lega in the north, while the Five Star Movement had its main success in the south. At the moment, the two populist parties actually represent the two parts of Italy \u201d, adding that people in the North felt unrepresented by the central government and those in the South abandoned by it. Several interviewees mentioned the link between populism and the mafia in the South, with populism boosting the influence of the mafia as a cultural factor. For example, at a time of growing polarisation and general uncertainty, some people rely on the mafia to impose rules and certainty. Another proposition was that the context in Udine was easier for CSOs, not only because it is a wealthier region, but also a border region with a more open mindset and better educated young people. In Reggio di Calabria, unemployment and other socioeconomic issues were mentioned as complicating the situation with populism. The political science experts also pointed to differences in Italy between the bigger cities and the peripheral towns and villages, with the latter more exposed to populist messages, such as Euroscepticism. ",
        "109 Populism was seen by the interviewees as a challenge for the mainstream parties and, in the longer term, for democracy as it tests the limits of democracy. It is also seen as a threat to EU institutions and the international order, but not so much to the rule of law. Some political science experts warned about threats to democracy based on the pressure on CSOs and majoritarianism . One academic expert in populism saw the dangers of polarisation \u2013 \u201c a brutalisation of the political battle, of the political competition, and of social relations \u201d. A specific aspect was hostility towards women by populists in Italy, especially Lega. There was a serious warning of CSOs closing down and other effects of populist policies: \u201c And this is the way democracy is being killed. The main problem we are having right now is that we are thinking that politics is just voting, and so the majority wins. But this is not democracy, this is Bonapartism, this is the room just before dictatorship .\u201d With regard to the question of the weak points of populists , the predominant opinion was that there are two main impediments to populists. One factor is the limiting influence of international factors , such as the role of the EU as well as international relations in general. This includes the concerns of isolationism and the risk for the economy. The other factor is that there are actually two broad groups of people in Italy who do not subscribe to populist policies and would resist them , \u201cthe ones open to the values of inclusion, solidarity, cultural exchanges, and the social dimension,\u201d according to one regional official with knowledge on the matter, as well as the economic actors concerned about the economic dimension. Populists were seen as a danger to themselves as they provide too many promises they cannot keep and for which they don\u2019t have really a plan, or as one academic expert in populism said, \u201c they are more a symptom of the difficulties and the malaise than a solution \u201d. Their own communication style was seen as repulsive for many, so what attracts many voters, turns many others away. Concerning whether populists have a point in some cases, the most common answer was that populists are very good communicators and can talk about the anxieties of people towards income levels, jobs and migration and offer them easy answers. Academic experts on populisms said that populists should not be underestimated and that the people who voted for them (referring specifically for those who voted for the M5S) did this for a reason and this vote should be respected. On the issue of the responsibility of politicians , the interviewees thought that traditional politicians failed to acknowledge public concerns and communicate them in a new way. One regional official, interviewed for the study, pointed to Matteo Renzi\u2019s policies, which stabilised the country financially and improved GDP and employment, but were felt to be distant by the people, \u201cwho did not feel this improvement\u201d and \u201cwere more affected by fears in terms of immigration, security, working place, and about their future and their children\u2019s future\u201d. There was the wrong perception of the EU as imposing rules, without regard to rights and security. According to one interviewee, the populist answer was \u201cItaly first\u201d, implying it was successful. ",
        "110 7.5.2. Related aspects: direct democracy, online disinformation and Euroscepticism With regard to direct democracy , CSO activists and political science experts in Italy warned that it has been exploited by populists. In their words, there is no point in more referenda if the institutional architecture remains the same. They said that populists falsely claim or misinterpret the use of forms of direct democracy \u2013 such as the \u201cdigital democracy\u201d of M5S or \u201cconsultations\u201d of limited number of citizens. Populism and the demands for direct democracy are linked and \u201c part of a phenomenon that people trust politicians less, recognise authority less, and are more competent, so they think they can have a say directly in political decisions\u201d , according to one regional official with knowledge and experience on these issues. A political scientist recommended the development, instead, of participative and deliberative practices, especially at local level, which on some policies would be very sensible and potentially useful, as it is not simply a binary \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in referenda, which are very prone to emotions and feelings of the moment and thus risky. In terms of online disinformation , respondents identified it as a real threat and as the main channel for the spread of populist messages \u2013 i.e. the language of disinformation and populism can be equated. The form of the message was also pointed to, as populists use short messages without deeper analysis or reasoning, or a simplistic approach to complex phenomena. It was pointed out that online disinformation may influence the outcome, along with polarisation, hate speech and related aspects. Interviewees pointed out that the populist parties \u2013 Lega and M5S \u2013 are very skilled in using online and social media as \u201c\u2026 social media match the populist mentality... Presence on social media can strengthen the role of the leader because there is dialogue between the leader and the followers \u201d, according to an academic expert on populism. Furthermore, one CSO reported that a factor for populism was \u201ca hate campaign structured wisely also on social media by very experienced people\u201d (in reference to right-wing strategist Steve Bannon). Political science experts pointed out that the public has low trust in mainstream media in the country as they are not operating as watchdogs, but rather as close to authorities. One academic expert on populism recommended ensuring a plurality of information, independent public channels and morality ( sic ) of journalists. ",
        "111 Populism is closely related to Euroscepticism , according to political science experts in Italy, due to the nationalism that puts \u201cItaly first\u201d and, thus, rejects the EU and puts the blame on \u201cothers\u201d and the alleged attempts to rob the country of its wealth, privileges, history and so on. The EU is portrayed as an adversary by populists, who contrast the Europe of [too strict] rules and liberal market bureaucracy with themselves as advocates of the people against the unfair treatment of the EU and member states such as France and Germany. One academic expert on populism criticised the EU, which is seen as the right arm of neoliberalism, leading to inequalities and the socioeconomic problems that have contributed to populism. According to some interviewees, there is a clear clash between those who want to destroy the EU \u2013 the populists \u2013 and those who want to defend it. As mentioned above, the EU is portrayed, and increasingly seen, as too distant, failing to deal with concerns like migration, jobs and security. 7.5.3. Measures and levels of addressing the populist challenge On the most important measures necessary to address the populist challenge, the interviewees mentioned that dealing with socioeconomic issues is a must, especially in the south of the country. For the EU, one regional official with knowledge on EU affairs mentioned that it needs to address the socioeconomic needs of the people. Another academic expert in populism listed unemployment, public services and offshoring as problems to be tackled. Positive values in society should be reaffirmed against xenophobia and racism to address the demographic crisis and emphasise the positives of integration. The benefits of the EU are taken for granted, so they should be reminded and reaffirmed \u2013 peace, security, social security, freedom and the tangible benefits that contribute to the standard of living, such as roads, food safety and fighting climate change. It is also worth noting that, according to CSOs, attempting to talk to and persuade populist politicians is an unsuccessful approach. With regard to the question of assigning responsibility and what could be done at different levels \u2013 regional/local, national and European \u2013 to tackle the negative effects of populist parties, the interviewees suggested several approaches. According to one regional official with knowledge on EU affairs, there should be a mobilisation at all levels, valorising the benefits of the EU in a clear way and well-communicated at local level. Furthermore, this interviewee also said that: \u201cat the EU level, the language of the EU has to be adapted for each citizen, each citizen must feel understood and helped.\u201d ",
        "112 The EU should show that it can help Italian citizens with migration, the standard of living and other important issues for Italian citizens. At EU level, tackling the migration crisis should be addressed as other EU members have abandoned Italy to face this problem alone, thus providing Lega with fertile ground for campaigning. In terms of whether populists change once in power and if they moderate or amplify their positions, most responses in Italy point to the observation that populists tend to moderate their positions under the circumstances. For example, many of their social and economic promises are unrealistic and restrained by economic and political realities. One political science expert considered that there will be a clash between the governing populist parties\u2019 promises. For example, M5S\u2019 promise to increase social payments in the South will be seen as a problem among the Lega voters in the North, according to an academic expert in populism. Also, M5S is seen as a smaller problem than Lega. In that regard, it is expected that political competitors should face the populists, but such players are currently missing. 7.5.4. Populism, impediments to CSOs and civil society responses The interviewees mentioned a number of initiatives and approaches currently in place to tackle populism, but it should be kept in mind that many CSOs and citizens do not recognise populism as a distinct challenge (the term is still unclear to the public, see the remarks above), so the examples were provided for associated phenomena. Among other things, there are activities to prevent, combat, and report hate speech online and offline as part of an international network of young people active in promoting human rights online and combating the different forms of hatred and discrimination that leading to violence, radicalisation, and violations of human rights. Racism was mentioned as a special problem for Italy, borne out of the perceived competition for jobs, but allowed to grow into a dangerous phenomenon. There are media literacy and digital literacy campaigns, especially with young people, and a number of organisations working with migrants and refugees. It should be noted that the town of Riace, which entered the world news for its mayor\u2019s attempts to develop a model for integrating migrants, is also located in Reggio di Calabria, but is now being challenged by the populist government. 135 135 The mayor of the small town of Riace Domenico Lucano started welcoming migrants at the height of the refugee crisis and was even hailed among the world\u2019s 50 greatest leaders by the Fortune magazine. In 2018, controversy ensued with the new Italian government. See: \u201cPro-refugee Italian mayor arrested for 'aiding illegal migration\u201d, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/pro-refugee-italian-mayor-arrested-suspicion-aiding-illegal-migration-domenico- lucano-riace and \u201cItaly: Migrants in Riace to be transferred away\u201d, 13 October 2018, BBC, https://www.bbc.com/news/world- europe-45852952 ",
        "113 Another notable CSO initiative in Italy was a national campaign to tackle Euroscepticism and nationalism called \u201cUpside Down\u201d. The campaign aimed to empower citizens as political actors, make them aware of their role as civil society, talk to and understand people\u2019s concerns especially in the periphery of the country. The organisations Arci, tackling racism, and Non Una Di Meno, addressing sexism, were mentioned as examples of CSOs countering aspects of populism. The most serious impediments , as reported by CSOs in Italy that are tackling the populist challenge, are financial and human resources, growing negative attitudes towards them and, most importantly, the shrinking civic space in general. With regard to financial support, this includes limitations in government or municipal funding imposed by populists in power. A civic activist in Reggio di Calabria said that the organisation can rely only on working directly with EU funding as there was scarce funding at municipal, regional and, especially, national level, or none at all. They also pointed to the lack of desire of young people to join CSOs and their causes due to public apathy and a lack of understanding of the importance of CSO work. There was a reported case of media censorship, although it was also said that the rule of law still protects CSO activities. The worst affected seem to be organisations working with migrants and refugees as they face abruptly changed attitudes (from \u201cheroes\u201d to alleged \u201ccriminals\u201d). The interviewees were asked to recommend the most important actions for CSOs to undertake to tackle the populist challenge in terms of urgent steps, specific programmes and longer-term strategies , as well as possible allies. It is worth quoting a CSO activist of a youth CSO with national and international experience, who said that \u201cthe main resource for doing politics, mostly at the civil society level, is passion, and then we can find solutions.\u201d Another CSO activist recommended public debates to address the problem of a \u201c shrinking space for the CSOs \u201d, among other things. A CSO activist also proposed the organisation of counter- demonstrations and/or displaying symbols against populist values, such as displaying European and federalist flags during Lega\u2019s nationalist demonstrations. ",
        "114 At regional and local level , one key recommendation is to find and mobilise people who care about their town, community and region and who can stand up for them, according to a CSO activist from Italy. There should be more cooperation between citizen associations, and the elimination of existing rivalries, to share goals and resources. The general recommendation for CSOs at national and EU level is to become more political. There should be more cooperation among them, education for citizens, and more appearances and coverage on traditional big media as well as on social media. Especially regarding the EU, there should be new symbols and symbolic actions (demonstrations, concerts, etc.) to tackle Euroscepticism with the message that the EU brings freedom, democracy, solidarity, the welfare state and rule of law. Necessary activities are human rights\u2019 education and democratic active citizenship education for the youth. As a channel for the youth, it was recommended to use Instagram, and for adults Facebook, in order to reach out to them. There was a special emphasis by a CSO activist in Reggio di Calabria on youth, with reintroducing civic education in schools, working on educating the youth and raising awareness of populism, civic participation, the democratic process and elections. In terms of necessary resources , the most frequently recommended were human resources, funding, knowledge and a blueprint or strategic framework for tackling populism developed at EU level. There are recommendations for the EU to provide funding and training for communication tools against populism. Also, it is recommended that there should be direct EU funding for CSOs and with eased access, especially considering that local and national authorities with populists in power put limitations on CSOs. Finally, when asked about what is missing from current CSO debates, one CSO activist, interviewed for the study, answered that: \u2013 that is, a proposal for a new, positive narrative on Europe with concrete proposals. \u201cWe don\u2019t only have to defend the EU, because if you are arguing with someone and you are just defending a position, you have actually already lost the debate. We have to propose a new model of Europe, to defend the EU but also to give the perspective of changing the EU\u201d ",
        "115 7.6. Conclusions and recommendations for Italy 7.6.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level In Italy, there is a combination of socioeconomic and cultural factors that drives populism, but an emphasis on the socioeconomic factors with financial and job uncertainty. The crisis of political parties was as important contributing factor as people have lost trust in mainstream parties. \u2018Populism\u2019 itself as a term is not very clear among the public , not little used and conflated with other phenomena, such as racism and xenophobia. There are different factors at play for different social groups \u2013 lower income groups suffer from unemployment and economic uncertainty and the middle class is concerned about downgrading. There are significant differences between the North and the South of the country regarding populism and their respective political choices as Lega wins in the North and M5S in the South. In the North, there is anxiety about losing safety, security, income and living standards, while in the South it is more about social benefits and expectations about increasing incomes. Moreover, those voting for populists in the North feel underrepresented by the central government and those in the South abandoned by it; in the South, anti-migrant sentiments are linked to perceived competition for jobs. That is, in the South, the strongest factors are socioeconomic, connected to the underdevelopment of the region and the expectations of citizens that the government will intervene to solve these needs, thus opening up easy opportunities for populist promises. The ensuing xenophobia and racism in the South is, therefore, linked to competition for resources with migrants, refugees and foreigners. Populism was seen as a challenge for the mainstream parties and, in the longer term, for democracy as it tests the limits of democracy , bringing high levels of polarisation in politics and society.

        "116 The traditional parties are also considered responsible for the rise of populism mainly as they failed to acknowledge public concerns and communicate them in a new way, felt distant to be distant by the people, who were more affected by fears of immigration, security, jobs and the future. Direct democracy is seen to be exploited by populists, prone to emotion and risky as there is no developed institutional infrastructure for referenda which, for example, eventually brings about less trust in politicians and authority. As a viable alternative, participative and deliberative practices, especially at local level, should be introduced. Online disinformation was identified as a real threat and the main channel for the spread of populist messages \u2013 i.e. the language of fake news and populism can be equated. Online disinformation may influence the outcome of elections, along with polarisation, hate speech and related aspects. Both main populist parties \u2013 Lega and M5S \u2013 are very skilled in using online and social media. Populism is closely related to Euroscepticism , according to experts in Italy, due to the nationalism that puts \u201cItaly first\u201d and, thus, rejects the EU and puts the blame on \u201cothers\u201d and the alleged attempts to rob the country of its wealth, privileges, history and so on. There is a clash between those who want to destroy the EU \u2013 the populists \u2013 and those who want to defend it. 7.6.2. Conclusions regarding the role of civil society organisations Italian civil society is strong in social service provision in both Udine and Reggio di Calabria with larger more professional civil society organisations, in which CSOs\u2019 paid employees are mostly concentrated. The vast majority of organisations have no employees, are small and largely volunteer-based. There is little by way of provision for direct democracy. Media literacy projects do address fake news and disinformation. Euroscepticism and the promotion of EU values are, to an extent, addressed by CSOs in both regions. ",
        "117 The mapping of the CSOs active in the areas of promoting EU values, civic education and engagement, civil liberties, direct democracy, support to minorities, refugees and migrants and tackling online disinformation, which was conducted in the regions based on official information sources 136 , reveals a marginal number of CSOs implementing activities that can potentially tackle populism, out of all those registered.

In the Udine region of Italy, there are an estimated 4,494 CSOs in total, of which 0.47%, or 22, were deemed to carry out potentially relevant activities: 5 working on European values, 4 on civic education and engagement, 1 on disinformation, and a majority \u2013 12 \u2013 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism. In Reggio di Calabria, out of 2,433 CSOs, about 0.95%, or 23, were deemed to be potentially relevant: 2 working on European values, 8 on civic education and engagement, 14 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism and 1 on direct democracy and participation. The findings were confirmed by the interviews with CSOs based in the regions: \u201cIn Reggio Calabria, specifically, there are activities raised by some organisations \u2026 which promote democratic values, freedoms or social protection, and denounce corruption. But CSOs are not so numerous in the region\u201d.

        "118 towards them and, most importantly, the shrinking civic space in general. This includes limitations in government or municipal funding imposed by populists in power but also the lack of desire of young people to join CSOs and their causes due to public apathy and a lack of understanding about the importance of CSO work. The worst affected seem to be organisations working with migrants and refugees as they face abruptly changed attitudes (from \u201cheroes\u201d to alleged \u201ccriminals\u201d). CSOs and citizens do not recognise populism as a distinct type of challenge. 7.6.3. Recommendations 1 A knowledge base and blueprint (strategic framework) for tackling populism should be developed and built as CSOs and citizens do not recognise it as a distinct type of challenge (the term \u201cpopulism\u201d is unclear). 2 The wish for more direct democracy should be addressed through the development of interactive and collaborative participatory and deliberative practices of citizen engagement between elections, especially at local level. 3 The internationalisation of non-metropolitan areas through economic and cultural exchanges, international networking, the showcasing of solidarity and social inclusion should be fostered. 4 Cooperation and collaboration at local level should be developed, including with non-populist politicians to address citizens\u2019 concerns. 5 Investment and support for formal and informal education is required \u2013 such as human rights and democratic active citizenship, especially for youth. 6 Media literacy and digital literacy campaigns and training should be organised. 7 A civic sphere at local level should be developed, including public debates on critical issues such as tackling racism and populism. 8 Investment in social media and communication training to counter populism should be developed. 9 The EU should improve its communication strategy to reaffirm positive values and promote the EU\u2019s achievements and funding. 10 A new, positive narrative on Europe with concrete proposals should be elaborated and discussed.

        "119 8. The case of Poland: populism, citizens and CSOs 8.1. The rise of populism and populist parties in Poland The political parties identified for the purposes of the study in Poland are three: Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 (PiS or Law and Justice), Kukiz \u201915 and KORWiN (now known as Wolno\u015b\u0107). Table 16. Populism Index of selected parties in Poland PiS won the 2015 presidential and parliamentary elections on the basis of a narrative of \u201cPoland in ruins\u201d, which combined the perception that market reforms in Poland are splitting the country into those who benefit from the reforms and those who do not, with the view that the Platforma Obywatelska (PO) government was ignoring the people in the less prosperous countryside who have to make do with insufficient infrastructure. PiS promised to build the country back from the ruins by rolling back the retirement age reform, vastly expanding family benefits and expanding house building on state- owned land on the basis of a \u201cmajoritarian doctrine\u201d, which it later applied to the court system, funding for NGOs and the political opposition. 137 PiS has a core electorate of older, rural voters with lower education levels and conservative Roman Catholics, but has also reached out to younger generations and swing voters disappointed by 8 years of government by PO. According to the CHES analysis (see Table 3 ), PiS is strongly anti-elite, authoritarian, nationalistic and socially traditional. 137 Owczarek, D., \u201cThe Roots of Populism in Poland: Unsustainable Growth and Cultural Backlash\u201d, 2017.

",
        "120 Kukiz \u201915 is a political association headed by Pawel Kukiz, who came third in the 2015 presidential election with 21% of the vote. It coordinated with the radical far-right Ruch Narodowy party during the 2015 parliamentary elections, gaining 8.8% of the vote. It is primarily aiming to break up the monopoly of political parties in Poland and replace proportional representation with a first-past-the-post electoral system, and has combined radical anti- establishment rhetoric with the promotion of conservative solutions, like a strong executive, and more direct democracy. The regional trends in the populist vote in the two regions of Poland - P\u0142ocki (PL) and Nowos\u0105decki (NW), show that between 2008-2018 the populist vote demonstrates patterns of relative decline in populist support in 2011, followed by an upward trend (please, see the trends and comparison across all eight regions in the Appendix 3: The populist vote at regional level: an overview of trends across regions and time ). KORWiN 138 is a Eurosceptic, traditional, authoritarian and right-wing libertarian party led by MEP Janusz Korwin-Mikke. It took 4.8% of the vote in the 2015 parliamentary election 8.2. Demographic indicators and the populist vote in Poland at national level The study also carried out an analysis of a number of demographic indicators \u2013 gender, age, education and employment \u2013 to examine their relationship with populist voting patterns at national level. 139 In terms of gender , in Poland in 2015, women were more likely to vote for PiS than men, but overall were less likely to vote for a populist party, due to the greater popularity of Kukiz\u201915 and KORWiN amongst men. 138 Now known as Wolno \u015b\u0107. 139 The study used national exit poll data, which provides an estimate as to the voting behaviour of particular demographic groups, to consider possible trends in voting patterns across these groups, both within individual countries and for particular parties. It allowed also for observations of any common features that hold across the countries studied. The analysis at national level is based on available public data and the analysis at regional level is based on the citizen surveys, conducted for the purposes of this study and provided in the national chapters. ",
        "121 In terms of age , in both the legislative and presidential elections of 2015 in Poland, young people were more likely to vote for populist parties than their older counterparts. However, the youth vote is much more divided between different populist parties than that of older voters, who tended to vote PiS if they were to vote populist at all. Both the Kukiz\u201915 and KORWiN campaigns were more successful with younger voters, whilst PiS performed better with voters who were older. It has been suggested that a surprisingly large youth vote was a crucial factor in PiS\u2019 success 140 , but it seems that they failed to achieve a clear victory amongst young people in the same way parties like M5S and LFI have elsewhere. With regard to education , the vote share for the Law and Justice party in the 2015 Polish legislative election varied by a fairly wide margin between those with at least secondary education and those who had either only primary or lower secondary education, or who had received basic vocational education. Again, those who had received more education were less likely to cast a vote for a populist party. The pattern of vote share received by the Kukiz\u201915 and KORWiN campaigns appears much less linked to education level. In terms of employment and the populist vote in Poland, the 2015 legislative elections showed that farmers, pensioners and blue- collar workers had the highest share of support for PiS, who were also very popular among the other groups compared to the other populist parties. Students preferred, in equal share, Kukiz\u201915 and KORWiN, but the other groups preferred Kukiz\u201915 to KORWiN, but with PiS unrivalved among the three. PiS had the smallest advantage among students, compared to the other populist parties. 140 G\u0142owacki, W., \u201cPrawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 kr\u00f3luje w polskim internecie.

        "122 8.3. Citizen surveys in the Nowos\u0105decki and P\u0142ocki regions of Poland The citizen surveys were focused on eliciting the opinion of citizens specifically in the two regions in focus in Poland \u2013 Nowos\u0105decki and P\u0142ocki. The survey included 36 closed-ended questions and demographic information about the respondents for each of the two regions ( Appendix 5: Citizen survey questionnaire provides the full questionnaire ). It was carried out online on a voluntary basis. These are exploratory surveys meant to complement the other research methods as the samples are small for a fully-fledged representative study 141 , but it should be noted that, in this case, the sample sizes in terms of age, gender, education, occupation, income bracket, religious affiliation and political preference provide a solid basis for the purposes of the study (e.g. around 60% female and 40% male respondents took part in each of the regions and the political affiliation sample is close to the election results). A total of 94 respondents in Nowos\u0105decki 142 and 94 respondents 143 in P\u0142ocki took part in the survey. As noted in the beginning of this report, the two regions were selected for their different socio-economic characteristics and the higher level of populist vote. The table below shows the main indicators. P\u0142ocki, which is located to the north-west of the capital Warsaw, roughly in the centre of the country, is the wealthier of the two with a GDP 111% of the EU28 average and higher than the national average of 68%. Nowos\u0105decki, which is located in the south of Poland, is the poorer region at 43% GDP of the EU28 average and much lower than the national average. The two regions have similar population numbers. Table 17.

",
        "123 The current analysis is based on select questions pertinent to the five dimensions of populism as identified in this study: anti- elite, majoritarian, authoritarian, monocultural and Eurosceptic with an additional focus on issues such as direct democracy, disinformation and sovereignty. While only select questions are provided in the text, all answers were taken into account. Moreover an analysis of the socio- demographic characteristics of the respondents is provided based on the respective questions in the citizen survey. With regard to age , in Nowos\u0105decki, PiS voters are represented by nearly every age group and are very close to the regional average (total), which are about 21%-23% for each group between 18-24, 45-54 and 55-64 years of age, and about 11%-12% for the rest age groups, while those of Kukiz\u201915 are somewhat younger, half of them between 18 and 24 years of age. In the P\u0142ocki region, PiS voters are represented by diverse age groups in nearly equal share, while the other populist party, Kukiz\u201915, has a higher proportion of younger voters \u2013 all under 34 years old ( Appendix 20 . Figure 37-38 ). In terms of gender , 76% of PiS respondents are female, which is the highest share compared to the other parties (except PSL), and the share of female respondents is for Kukiz\u201915 is 63%. In the P\u0142ocki region, PiS respondents are 67% female and 33% male, while for Kukiz\u201915 it is a 50-50 split ( Appendix 20 . Figure 12- 40 ). When it comes to education , in the Nowos\u0105decki region, respondents with a high school education predominate for both PiS (60%) and Kukiz\u201915 (63%). The non- populist PO has a higher proportion of postgraduates (42%) than the populist PiS (22%) and Kukiz\u201915 (25%). In P\u0142ocki, some 81% of PiS voters have either an undergraduate degree or high school education (38% and 43%, respectively), and Kukiz\u201915 are represented entirely by respondents with a high school education. Non-populist party supporters have relatively higher levels of education the populist parties, with postgraduates accounting for 30% of PO respondents and 33% of PSL respondents ( Appendix 20. Figure 41-42 ). With regard to employment , in the Nowos\u0105decki region, PiS and Kukiz\u201915 voters are represented by a variety of groups, most of all those in full-time employment \u2013 38% and 50%, respectively ( Appendix 20 . Figure 43-44 ) Concerning annual household income , in the Nowos\u0105decki region, the highest share of PiS supporters (41%) is within the 18,000-41,999 PLN bracket, 25% are below this in the lowest bracket, while Kukiz\u201915 has a higher share of higher income respondents \u2013 38% are within the 42,000-62,999 PLN group. In the P\u0142ocki region, 35% of PiS voters are within the lowest income group compared to 50% for Kukiz\u201915, although Kukiz\u201915 supporters have higher share of the higher income group \u2013 50% are within the 42,000-62,999 PLN bracket ( Appendix 20 . Figure 13-46 ). With regard to religion and party affiliation , in the Nowos\u0105decki region, all of the populist PiS and Kukiz\u201915 supporters are Catholics, but that is considering that the total share for the region is 80%. Compared to this, 63% of the non-populist PO are Catholics, with the rest either with no religion or preferred not to say ( Appendix 20. Figure 47-48 ). ",
        "124 With regard to anti-elite attitudes , the respondents are somewhat split on the issue. For example, in P\u0142ocki, 40% agree and 38% disagree that politicians are from a different socio-economic class to other citizens, with 22% undecided. Voters for the non-populist opposition disagree to a larger extent with that view \u2013 59% in Nowos\u0105decki region and 52% in P\u0142ocki region among the PO voters. In comparison, PiS voters (the share of agreement is 33% in NW and 29% in PL) and other populist voters and non- voters (26% agree in NW and 63% in PL)are more inclined to consider that this is true or don\u2019t have an opinion on the issue (see Appendix 19 , Figures 1 and 2 ). In terms of majoritarian and authoritarian attitudes , there are somewhat divergent views. There is a strong backlash against breaching civil liberties even for the sake of majority. This is demonstrated by the low support for the notion that the government should be allowed to violate civil liberties when acting in the interest of the majority \u2013 62% in Nowos\u0105decki and 74% in P\u0142ocki disagree. Supporters of the ruling PiS tend to have higher support for the proposition to curb civil liberties (33% in NW and 25% in PL), which is also supported by non-voters (26% in NW and 19% in PL) (see Appendix 19 : Figures 7 and 8 ). ",
        "125 Concerning authoritarianism, or \u201cfa\u00e7ade democracy\u201d, there is relatively high support for a strong leader who can act without parliamentary or judicial oversight , but also strong opposition to the idea \u2013 41% in P\u0142ocki and 31% in Nowos\u0105decki agree, but 45% and 46%, respectively, disagree. Supporters of opposition non-populists and, to a lesser extent, opposition populist parties support it much less. PiS voters (43% in NW and 51% in PL) and non-voters (38% in NW and 44% in PL) tend to support this proposition more than the others (see Appendix 19 : Figures 5 and 6 ). Figure 40. Strong, unchecked leader Forms of direct democracy , such as referenda, enjoy a very high level of support in both Nowos\u0105decki (77%) and P\u0142ocki (68%), with just 8% and 12%, respectively, opposing the idea. It is worth noting that opposition non- populist and populist voters (e.g. PO voters share of \u201cagree\u201d is 88% in NW and 83% in PL), as well as non-voters (nearly 100% in NW and 69% in PL), in both regions generally show a higher level of support for direct referenda than voters of the ruling PiS party (70% in NW and 50% in PL) (see Appendix 19 : Figures 3 and 4 ). ",
        "126 With regard to the economic benefits of migration , 42% in Nowos\u0105decki disagree that migration is good for the local economy, whilst 26% agree. In P\u0142ocki, the numbers are 49% and 24%, respectively. Supporters of the ruling PiS party (57% in NW and 69% in PL) and non-voters (65% in NW and 63% in PL) reject this notion to a higher extent, while the opposition populists are largely undecided. Voters of the opposition non-populist parties (e.g. PO share is 33% in NW and 34% in PL) are inclined to agree that migrants are good for the local economy, yet there are high shares of undecided respondents among them \u2013 a third in Nowos\u0105decki and half in P\u0142ocki (see Appendix 19 : Figures 9 and 10 ). Figure 42. Migration benefits local economy On the issue of religion as an essential part of national identity , the respondents rather oppose the notion with 73% in P\u0142ocki and 74% in Nowos\u0105decki against it and just 17% and 16%, respectively, supporting it. The highest support is among PiS voters (PiS voters 59% in NW and 44% in PL), but still more of them disagree. Opposition party voters, populist and non-populist (PO voters 74% in NW and 87% in PL) alike, reject the notion (see Appendix 19 : Figures11 and 12 ). Figure 43. Religion and national identity ",
        "127 EU membership enjoys very high levels of support in both regions, which is relatively unopposed \u2013 73% approval of EU membership in P\u0142ocki, against just 13% rejecting it and 14% undecided. Support for EU membership in Nowos\u0105decki is at 66%, with just 17% disapproving and 17% undecided. As this is an important issue, it is worth looking at further findings across the regions and party lines. In terms of EU membership being a good thing, the vast majority of respondents in the Nowos\u0105decki region either strongly agree (35%) or agree (31%), with very few registering disagreement (7% strongly disagree and 10% disagree). The highest support for EU membership is among the non-populist Civic Platform with 78% (64% strongly agree and 14% agree), followed by the populist Kukiz\u201915 with 63% and PiS with 54%. It should be noted that the populist Kukiz\u201915 voters are divided, with 38% strongly disagreeing that EU membership is good for Poland, while rejection of EU membership is at 29% among non-voters. In the P\u0142ocki region, 43% strongly agree and 30% agree that EU membership is good for Poland, with just 14% undecided and 13% opposed. The highest support is among those who did not express a political affiliation (100%), other small parties (90%), the non-populist Peasant Party (86%), and Civic Platform (83%). Those who oppose EU membership are voters of the populist Kukiz\u201815 (all of their respondents), PiS (26%) and non-voters (13%). Among PiS and non-voters, there are very high shares of undecided respondents \u2013 27% and 25%, respectively. (see Appendix 19 , Figures 13 and 14 ). Figure 44. EU membership In terms of the sovereignty debate , there is relatively high support for the EU returning powers to the national government \u2013 34% in P\u0142ocki and 44% in Nowos\u0105decki, but disagreement with this notion is also high at 41% and 23%, respectively, with a high proportion of undecided respondents. Supporters of the governing PiS agree to the highest degree about this, with nearly 70% (69% in NW and 67% in PL). Non-voters are either undecided or support the notion (29% in NW and 57% in PL agree). Non-populist opposition voters, on the other hand, tend to disagree with returning powers to the national government, almost half in P\u0142ocki and slightly less in Nowos\u0105decki, or are undecided \u2013 a third or half of them, depending on the region (see Appendix 19 , Figures 15 and 16 ). ",
        "128 Figure 45. EU and national government powers A summary of the positions across political affiliation shows several observations. In fact, there is an observable difference between the voters of the ruling party and the rest. Proponents of the ruling populist party, PiS, tend to be more \u201cpopulist\u201d in many aspects than even the other populist party voters and are inclined to support anti-elite, majoritarian and authoritarian notions to a greater extent. Opposition populist party voters seem to shun, for example, authoritarian tendencies when their party is not in power. It is worth noting that non-voters also tend to agree with populist positions to a high degree. Voters of non-populist parties are much less inclined to support populist positions. Younger voters, the less well- educated, the unemployed and those with a lower household income tend to support populist positions to a higher degree. Concerning anti-elite sentiments , in both P\u0142ocki and Nowos\u0105decki regions, non- populist voters of the Civic Platform oppose the position to a larger extent than populist voters do, but there are differences among populists as those of the ruling PiS support it more and generally reject it less than those of the opposition populist Kukiz\u201915 (and in the P\u0142ocki region the Kukiz\u201915 voters have a very high share of undecided). With regard to the majoritarian aspect of populism , in both P\u0142ocki and Nowos\u0105decki regions, the voters of the ruling populist PiS, and to a lesser extent the unaffiliated (Nowos\u0105decki excluded) and non-voters, are inclined to show higher support to this proposal, but still the level of disapproval is higher among them. In both regions, the voters of the opposition \u2013 the non-populist Civic Platform and the populist Kukiz\u201915 \u2013 largely disapprove of majoritarianism. On the issue of authoritarianism , in both regions the supporters of non-government parties \u2013 regardless of whether they are populist or not \u2013 do not agree with it (non- populists) and/or are undecided (opposition populists). Only among the governing populist PiS party is there support for a strong leader. Non-voters (in both regions), and the voters of the opposition populist Kukiz 15 (in Nowos\u0105decki) tend to be divided generally in equal measure, in support and opposition. With regard to direct democracy , in both regions the non-voters, populists and non- populists alike support the statement, although with party and regional differences. E.g. voters of the governing PiS in P\u0142ocki support it to a lesser extent and in the P\u0142ocki region disapproval is somewhat higher among the unaffiliated, other small parties and PiS voters compared to the others. ",
        "129 With regard to migration and its local economic impact, in both regions supporters of ruling PiS party and non- voters reject this notion. Voters of the non- populist PO show higher level of support with about a third of them, but there are high levels if undecided. Regarding religion and national identity , there is identical situation in both regions as the non-populist and populist voters of Civic Platform and Kukiz\u201915 and non-voters reject the notion. The highest support is among PiS voters with about 30-40%, but large shares of them disagree too, especially in Nowos\u0105decki. Overall, there are more similarities than differences between the two regions, so it doesn\u2019t warrant a differentiated approach. Respondents in both regions are very pro- European, with positive views of Poland\u2019s EU membership, and do not think that the economy would be better off outside of the EU. Still, there is relatively high support for the notion of the EU returning powers to the national government , predominantly among PiS voters. In terms of EU membership , in both regions there is identical situation. The highest support for EU membership is among the opposition non-populist Civic Platform, followed by the opposition populist Kukiz\u201915, followed by the governing populist PiS. Rejection of EU membership is at its highest among non- voters and voters of the populist Kukiz\u201915 voters are divided on the issue with high share of disagreeing. 144 The citizen surveys were conducted in all eight regions in focus for the purposes of this study, using a closed-ended questionnaire. For further details and the methodology, please see the national chapters in this report. These key questions on the dimensions of populism include anti-elitist With regard to the sovereignty debate , in both the Nowos\u0105decki and P\u0142ocki regions, the governing PiS supporters agree to the highest extent and voters of the opposition non-populist Civic Platform voters reject it. The populist opposition Kukiz\u201915 and non- voters in both regions tend to agree in higher measure with the EU returning powers to the government. The comparison between the eight regions in focus (the two regions in Poland and the other six in the rest of the countries) in this study across eight key questions of the citizen surveys 144 can be seen in the Appendix 6: Comparison across the eight regions in focus . sentiments, authoritarian and majoritarian tendencies, attitudes towards migration, religion as a marker of national identity, opinion about EU membership and the sovereignty debate in the context if EU membership.

        "130 8.4. CSO environment and CSOs at regional level in Poland This section analyses the state of civil society organisations at regional level in Poland and assesses their potential role in tackling populism. There is a short overview of the situation at national level (see Appendix 18: CSO typologies and developments on national level in Poland for more information). 145, 146 This section is based on data from publicly available records and sources 147 and the CSO interviews conducted especially for this study are presented separately. The CSO environment in Poland experienced a substantial deterioration from 2008 to 2017 , according to the V- Dem Core Civil Society Index ( Appendix 8: V-Dem Core Civil Society Index ) as its score fell by 27.3% 148 , which was the largest drop of all the countries studied, compared to 1.6% in Austria, 6.5% in France and 6.2% in Italy. The 682 CSOs based in the P\u0142ocki region consist of 498 associations, 107 foundations, 72 cooperatives and 5 federations. Organisations use a mix of different employment arrangements, with around 32% of employment consisting of paid employees, 31% volunteers, 20% contractors and 14% other forms of agreement. Within these areas, the most frequent kinds of activities are leisure (31%), food collection (13%), clothing collection (9%) and rehabilitation and medical treatment (9%). 145 The section reviews the current and potential role of CSOs in countering populism and the populist narratives in view of socioeconomic factors, migration, direct democracy, Euroscepticism, EU values, civic education and the use of online disinformation. It examines the environment in which CSOs operate, the typology of CSOs at regional level and the activities CSOs undertake to address populism. There are examples of CSOs\u2019 initiatives, but the good practices identified to highlight the positive impact CSOs can have are presented elsewhere in this report. 146 It should be emphasised that there were vast differences in the available information between the different countries and the different regions within the same country, with definitions and data varying substantially even within a single country or region. The analysis took these circumstances into account and standardised the information to the extent possible; nevertheless, it necessarily imposed differences in these sections of the report between the countries and regions. 147 Sources for Poland include: http://casaxeuropa.org/english/; https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/BDL/start; http://fakty.ngo.pl/files/wiadomosci.ngo.pl/public/civicpedia/ Raport_Klon_Kondycja_2015.pdf; https://mojepanstwo.pl/; https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/web/wyszukiwarka-krs/strona- glowna; http://fakty.ngo.pl/wiadomosc/2006219.html; http://www.plock.eu/pl/wieloletni_program_rozwoju_wspolp racy_20162020.html; http://mapa.plock.eu/placecategory/organizacje/; http://fakty.ngo.pl/wiadomosc/2000001.html; http://imi.org.pl/; http://budzetyobywatelskie.pl/info/592/maraton-pisania- projektow-stary-sacz/#more-592; http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/res earch/files/The%2520Rise%2520of%2520Fact- Checking%2520Sites%2520in%2520Europe.pdf; http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/res earch/files/The%2520Rise%2520of%2520Fact- Checking%2520Sites%2520in%2520Europe.pdf; http://www.ceo.org.pl/pl/media/news/edukacja-medialna- jest 148 The civil society score of Poland fell from 0.9213 in 2008 to 0.67 in 2017 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0=fragile, 1=robust. For the other countries, please see the respective country sections. ",
        "131 Budgets also tend to be low , but that is in keeping with a city of its size (see Appendix 18: CSO typologies and developments on national level in Poland for more information), and there is a range of organisations of different sizes \u2013 25% operate on less than EUR 2,300 a year, 16% on EUR 2,301 to EUR 9,300, 16% on EUR 9,301 to EUR 18,600, 6% on EUR 18,601 to EUR 25,590 and 37% on more than EUR 25,590. Funding mostly comes from membership fees (25%), local government (24%) and donations and subscriptions (19%). The sources also identified a number of problems organisations face when carrying out their statutory activities. Over half indicated that their main problem was finances, which includes raising funds, financing employees and a lack of support from public institutions, and other problems included having insufficient material resources and equipment, complex legal and bureaucratic procedures, and a lack of interest from the private sector. The upshot is that there are developmental constraints on organisations in the area, a lack of opportunities to expand their activities and difficulties attracting both employees and volunteers. Based on our research, there are 1,369 CSOs in Nowos\u0105decki , of which 1,025 are associations, 197 foundations, 140 cooperatives and 7 federations. There\u2019s no data at the local level in regard to distribution by activity, but in the wider Ma\u0142opolskie region, of which Nowos\u0105decki is a part, 32% are active in sport, leisure, tourism and recreation, 18% in both culture and art and education, 7% in social services and assistance, 5% in healthcare and 4% in local development. In terms of human resources, 36% of organisations in Ma\u0142opolskie, in which Nowos\u0105decki is located, use paid employees, 22% occasionally use paid staff and 61% use volunteers. 45% of organisations depend only on volunteers. Organisations are fairly typical of Poland as a whole in terms of annual revenue, with 31% operating on less than EUR 2,300 a year, 42% on EUR 2,300 to EUR 23,200 and 27% on more than EUR 23,200. Most funding is sourced from public funds and from abroad. Problems faced by organisations in Ma\u0142opolskie include accessing funds and equipment. The civil society sector has a very low public profile. There is an upside to this, as the sector attracts little negative attention and, thus, meets fewer barriers related to a poor public image. With regard to tackling socioeconomic issues , financial problems for CSOs, many of which are active in the social sector, make it difficult for them to carry out their statutory activities, which address socioeconomic difficulties in the regions. Financial problems are particularly acute outside major urban areas, with lower operating budgets, a higher dependence on volunteers and less access to funding. Concerning the populist anti-migrant narrative , CSOs are facing serious challenges in their work related to migrants and refugees because of lack of funding and hostile political environment (please, see the next chapter \u201cFindings of the expert and CSO interviews\u201d for more details). ",
        "132 With regard to direct democracy or increased democratic participation, CSOs in both P\u0142ocki and Nowos\u0105decki are working to facilitate participatory budgeting. 149 In Nowos\u0105decki, the Foundation Institute of Innovation Thought holds conferences and \u201cmarathon writing projects\u201d to get people involved in participatory budgeting and give advice and instruction on what can be achieved in participatory budgeting, how to write a project well and how to promote a project. The only other organisation operating in this area is Polski Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Humanitarny, which provides training on participatory democracy in Nowos\u0105decki. When it comes to tackling online disinformation , the media literacy field in Poland is highly active, with 63 main stakeholders, including 19 CSOs. There are four main media literacy networks operating at national level and media literacy projects in Poland address content creation, critical thinking, intercultural dialogue and challenging hate speech, how to use different media and participation, engagement and interaction in social, cultural and economic life. The Civic Education Centre and Evens Foundation have developed a curriculum for media education, including teaching young people how to find and verify information, and encouraging students to create their own media. The project provides online training and materials to teachers, allowing them to then integrate these lessons into their work. Fact-checking is carried out by Demagog, which relies heavily on student volunteers and has an activist identity, which has led some to question its credibility as \u201cjust a bunch of students\u201d. 149 Participatory budgeting is a democratic process in which community members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget . With regard to tackling Euroscepticism , the Committee for the Defence of Democracy in P\u0142ocki is active in promoting European values, especially democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and actively opposes the populist government, and the Polish Foundation for European Integration supports democracy, societal cooperation and European integration. In Nowos\u0105decki, the European Integration Centre and Foundation Europe + are both active in promoting awareness of the EU and EU values. ",
        "133 8.5. Findings of the expert and CSO interviews This section presents the findings of the political science expert and CSO interviews (see the Appendix 4 on the questionnaire and Appendix 7 for a list of interviewed experts and CSO activists ) carried out in the two regions in focus in Poland. There are further conclusions, recommendations and cross-country comparisons in the concluding chapter of this report. The interviewees were based in the capital and in the two regions in focus. A political science expert with an outside perspective was also interviewed. Nine in-depth interviews were conducted in total. The answers are provided in a summarised form without referring to the names and positions of the respondents ( a list of respondents is provided in the appendices ). Most of the political science experts and CSO activists had strong opinions about the situation, and for the sake of the research their opinions are represented as provided in the interviews. This should not be construed in any way as an endorsement of these views and recommendations by the research team. The questions asked about the causes of populism in Poland, national and regional differences and similarities, and specific aspects related to populism, such as Euroscepticism, online disinformation, direct democracy, and the role of CSOs, including impediments and solutions. 8.5.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level The first question concerns the factors that drive populism in Poland and which are stronger according to the interviewees \u2013 socioeconomic or cultural. According to political science experts and CSO activists, the most important drivers of populism in Poland are cultural factors, taking precedence over socioeconomic factors . These are cultural anxieties and can be grouped in several sets, including multiculturalism, secularisation and gender equality, with an additional focus on LGBTQI+ rights, the perceived threat from foreign powers, and fear of refugees and Islam. One national CSO expert in populism in Poland said \u201c cultural anxiety is what is driving this whole wave\u2026it is largely about nationalism combined with something which you would call reactionary or traditional values. Defenders call them traditional. I would rather call them reactionary values \u201d. ",
        "134 Three regional CSOs \u2013 two from Nowos\u0105decki and one from P\u0142ocki region \u2013 listed additional reasons that helped propel populism such as lack of interest in politics among citizens, making them prone to following \u201ceasy\u201d populist narratives, disappointment with previous governments , lack of knowledge and fear of the unknown among the people of which the politicians are taking advantage. The economic factors remain secondary as all socio-economic groups vote for populists. But they also have a role, according to one of the Nowos\u0105decki CSOs and CSO expert on populism interviewed for the study. For example there are economic expectations by people and respectively disappointment with the still existing disparities between the quality of life in Poland and the other member states, blaming the elites for this gap. According to the interviewees quoted above, this is valid for younger people too as they don\u2019t remember the situation before (e.g. during socialist era and early transition). Another example provided from these interviews is that there was unequal distribution of the fruits of growth, especially between smaller towns and bigger cities as part of the socio- economic factors, which answered partly the next question in the interviews about possible regional differences in the factors of populism. The second question asked about the different factors at play in the different regions of the country and their similarity. With regard to regional differences, political science experts again pointed mostly to cultural factors and the role of regional centres. Maps of the last election results, according to national CSO expert in populism and a European expert in populism with close knowledge of Poland , show the differences between Western and Eastern Poland, with the Eastern and Southern part voting for the ruling party PiS, although of course this picture had nuances and was not absolutely \u201cblack and white\u201d. 150 These differences stem from the historical development of the country. Other opinions include the differences between bigger cities and smaller towns. For example, the bigger cities receive more EU funding (outside infrastructure) and the smaller populated areas feel more left behind. The link between economic and cultural factors on regional level, according to one CSO populism expert, was that the economically more advanced regions had higher levels of cultural advancement and respectively populism had less influence in such regions. A regional CSO representative was of the opinion that socioeconomic factors played an important role in the latest campaigns at local level, although at national level cultural factors may have been at work. The role of the Polish Catholic Church, especially at local level, should be taken into account as people are influenced by local church representatives. One national CSO expert in populism mentioned the role of national values and history, and opposition to the EU and globalisation as important in the regions. 150 For a map with references, please see also the Economist, \u201cImperial borders still shape politics in Poland and Romania\u201d, available at https://www.economist.com/graphic- detail/2018/11/21/imperial-borders-still-shape-politics-in- poland-and-romania ",
        "135 The third question was how the interviewees ranked the populist parties as a challenge . According to the answers, populism has clearly been identified as a challenge to democracy in Poland , the EU and the current international order with a CSO expert on populism saying bluntly that \u201cYou see this creeping authoritarianism in almost every aspect of life.\u201d According to an academic expert on populism, the reason why populism was more dangerous in the newer EU Member States (such as Poland and Hungary for example) is \u201cthat the democratic institutions are weaker and more fragile than in the West\u2026 Because they (i.e. the democratic institutions) are younger and that is\u2026 a very important difference\u201d with the weakening of checks and balances and generally the destruction of democratic institutions. The interviewees were also asked about the weaknesses of populist parties , including what drives people away from them and what factors limit their support, including in cases when there are widespread populist sentiments but less support than expected. According to the interviewees, there is trend of erosion in support for populists, although they will remain strong. The political science experts said that EU integration is a very serious limiting factor to populism for at least a couple of reasons. The EU is very popular even among populist party supporters and they cannot be seen as anti-European. Also, according to a national CSO expert in populism , it is difficult to establish an authoritarian state in the EU due to the openness of borders, the free market and free internet. There is also strong political and civil society opposition in the country. A local CSO activist said that there is a rationalisation in society that people who support populists are often aware that their solutions are short-term, unsustainable and even harmful in the longer-term. A similar view that short-term populist measures are detrimental in the long run was confirmed by other interviewee, a national CSO expert in populism. Another question asked whether populists have a point in some cases, even if most people disagree with them. The respondents in the interviews said that the government\u2019s social policies have become broadly popularised in the country. The policy of providing financial aid to families (Family 500+) was singled out as many families took advantage of it. However, it was criticised as a tool for mobilising voter support since it was a short-term solution that would bring problems in the future. With regard to the question about the responsibility of politicians \u2013 populist and mainstream \u2013 and to what extent populists were successful due to political rhetoric and polarisation, the interviewees offered several explanations. They said that the main weakness of mainstream parties was the high level of distrust towards them and that populists exploited these sentiments. ",
        "136 One CSO representative from Plock offered the view that \u201cmainstream parties in Poland are weak and do not propose attractive political and economic solutions. Given their poor performance in the past, people do not trust them. Populist parties exploit these sentiments. Given the negative experience with mainstream parties, populist\u2019s rhetoric find a fertile ground in the Polish society. In the last few years the polarisation of the society has been deepening in Poland and it is unsure whether it will reverse or go on even further.\u201d Also, in terms of polarisation, it was noted that the process was deepening with no prospect of improvement. According to an interviewed CSO expert on populism, this is despite the talk of national unity and 8.5.2. Related aspects: direct democracy, online disinformation and Euroscepticism The questionnaire included questions related to specific issues that are often associated with populism and its problems and solutions. On the issue of direct democracy , the opinions of the political science experts and CSO activists are generally negative towards a greater use direct democracy tools, such as referenda. A national CSO expert in populism said that there were high hopes years ago for the beneficial effects of referenda and similar direct democracy instruments for addressing the deficits of representative democracy, but the experience was rather disappointing. For example, it turned out that populists could easily manipulate referenda. There were opinions that direct democracy works better at local level, but within \u201ca very carefully developed legal environment, which protects the instruments of local democracy\u201d. Local referenda on local issues were given as a positive example, but they cautioned against national ones. Participatory budgeting was given as a positive example by one regional CSO activist as it was employed by local civic groups but, according to another academic expert in populism, may then be taken over by more experienced politicians. With regard to online disinformation and its role in the rise of populism, the interviewees provided their views and recommendations on how to tackle it, including in the context of controlled public media and a crisis of traditional media. According to political science experts and CSO representatives, online disinformation through social networks has made possible the rise of populists and their successes. This has happened in the backdrop of two phenomena: the full control over public media that is used to broadcast the governing party\u2019s positions and the dire situation of the mainstream media. \u201cPoland has never been so divided and most people in opinion polls say that Poland has never been so politically, ideologically divided as under this government.\u201d ",
        "137 As such, neither the public nor the private media can be relied on to effectively counter disinformation campaigns. As an example, a disinformation campaign completely turned around public opinion on the refugee issue with 70% supporting it before the campaign and 70% rejecting it afterwards, according to an academic expert in populism. It was mentioned, however, that foreign (i.e. Russian) propaganda has a limited direct influence in Poland, unlike other countries. Several solutions to online disinformation were offered. The main solution is education, according to those interviewed. It is important to note that they mentioned that civic education is missing in Poland as the basis for everything else. That is, civic education has never been carried out systematically in Poland, but only by CSOs that do it on a project-by-project basis due to resource limitations, as defined by a national CSO representative. There should also be more specialised education, such as media literacy, in order to teach people to critically work with information and media. There was a special emphasis, in this regard, placed on young people. With regard to the relationship between Euroscepticism and populism , the European Union is the main target for populists, which are deeply Eurosceptic, according to several interviewees \u2013 a national CSO expert in populism, European expert in populism and Poland and regional CSO representatives in Poland. It is vilified as the source of evil for the people, threatening cultural and ethnic homogeneity, instilling foreign (i.e. liberal) values and so on. It was pointed out that even at a symbolic level, populists in power were quick to remove EU flags and symbols. However, there is a paradox, according to the interviewees, as there is very high public support for EU membership (up to 80%), placing limitations on populist attacks on the EU. That is, populists want to benefit from the EU, but not adhere to its rules. In other words, populist parties and politicians are very Eurosceptic, but at the same time, the EU as a whole operates as a restraining factor on populists and, as the public in Poland is very pro-European, populists themselves restrain their attacks on the EU. 8.5.3. Measures and levels of addressing the populist challenge The interviewees were also asked about the most important measures necessary to address the populist challenge and assigning the responsibility at different levels. According to a national CSO representative and a national CSO expert in populism in Poland, the list of measures on national level to tackle populism should start with the judiciary and media , making sure they are independent and functional. This would provide the necessary basis for tackling the other phenomena related to populism, such as xenophobia, racism, sexism, distrust in democracy and disinformation. The other most important element is strengthening civil society as it is experiencing similar problems to the free media \u2013 i.e. the goal of the populists is to weaken and control CSOs that are critical of them. ",
        "138 One local CSO activist underlined that dealing with socioeconomic issues such as an inequality, poverty and social services would also help as a measure in dealing with populism, despite as mentioned above the socioeconomic issues are less important in driving populism compared to cultural factors. Also, with regard to responsibility at different levels (local/regional, national and European, where applicable), local government , according to the a national CSO expert in populism and a national CSO representative, and not so much regional government, has a lot of potential as it is more trusted and seen as more credible and democratically accountable than national government. Supporting local government, therefore, is crucial. The following recommendations were put forward with regard to the EU level . The EU should impose its values more strongly, including through Article 7At EU level, the Article 7 procedure proved very effective and the EU should not be afraid to use it and should not fear turning Polish citizens Eurosceptic. There was criticism towards Europe\u2019s political families for reportedly shielding their members from criticism and limiting the EU\u2019s effectiveness in restraining the populist challenge. There was high praise for the proposed European Values Instrument 151 , as identified by a national CSO experts in populism, but criticism that the EU is promoting democracy abroad whilst, at the same time, very hesitant in defending democracy in EU countries. The EU was also criticised for failing to adequately promote itself. The questionnaire asked about the possibility of populists to transform once in power, i.e. whether a mitigation of their positions can be observed so that they may be treated more like other parties. The predominant opinion in the survey was that populists do not moderate their positions once they get in power. Rather, the opposite happens. As they win elections, they radicalise their positions and policies. The general opinion was that cooperation with them was not effective as an approach. At the same time, however, one national CSO expert in populism said during an interview that an opening in the positions of populists, such as when they are ready to negotiate their positions, should be used to promote a common solution. 151 See the European Parliament motion on the need to establish a European Values Instrument to support civil society organisations that promote fundamental values within the European Union at local and national level http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOT ION&reference=B8-2018-0189&language=EN ",
        "139 8.5.4. Populism, impediments to CSOs and civil society responses The political science experts and CSOs were asked about civil society organisations and initiatives that are tackling the negative aspects of populism, mainly at regional level. According to one national CSO expert in populism with experience in civil society issues, as a rule, populism as such is not recognised specifically as a problem by CSOs, but is identified through related phenomena. As another national CSO expert in populism said, in order for CSOs to tackle populism, they should continue to do their work. That is, the existence of \u201ccivil societies is a threat to populist or authoritarian populist government\u201d. Hence, CSOs should continue with their core activities \u2013 gender equality, LGTB rights and countering extreme populist (i.e. radical right) groups. The interviewees said that most CSOs tackling populism are based in the capital with local operations. CSOs, especially local and regional CSOs, even if not specialised, are useful in tackling populism through their activities. Women\u2019s rights, grassroots and pro- democracy youth organisations, among others, are especially effective. With regard to the problems faced by CSOs , among the general problems mentioned were a lack of financial resources, knowhow and experience, a limited culture of philanthropy, the passivity of citizens, and lack of public awareness and mobilisation among the public about the serious issues (e.g. the problems of the judiciary seem distant). It was mentioned that CSOs lack the communication skills to effectively counteract populists, who are skilled communicators. Concerning a more specific question on the most serious impediments faced by CSOs at regional and national level because of populism, there were a number of issues raised. For example, populists in power have limited funding for CSOs they deem critical of them, or defunded them entirely. This is especially true for local CSOs as nearly half of their funding comes from public funds. This creates a problem for the independence of CSOs, especially at local level. Those interviewed reported that populists have started creating and supporting CSOs friendly to them to create parallel networks of so-called \u201cconservative CSOs\u201d, as identified by a national CSO expert in populism and knowledge of the CSO sector. Local CSOs report that funding depends on the political will of the authorities and is for a closed circle of organisations only. The negative environment created by populist politicians is considered a major impediment to the work of the organisations. This not only includes limited funding, but also preventing people from volunteering for certain organisations. The difficulty in carrying out long-term initiatives due to limited resources, as opposed to short-term projects, was also identified as an impediment. ",
        "140 Concerning the populist anti-immigration narrative , services for migrants can be particularly difficult to carry out. In Nowos\u0105decki, especially, populism poses a serious challenge. One organisation, Polski Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Humanitarny, which works with refugees in Nowos\u0105decki, reported that their work has been disrupted by people associated with far-right parties and that a group of people once set fire to a building because they thought it was supposed to hold refugees. The same organisation also described populism as a serious problem in the region, with people there susceptible to populist narratives, which are strongly anti- migrant. The effects of a populist government and a less secure civil society are being felt by CSOs, who have reported that it has a negative impact on civic engagement and volunteering, and the fragility of funding arrangements at local and national level that depend on the \u201cpolitical will\u201d. The same organisations have called for more funding independent of public authorities in Poland, funding for awareness-raising activities, training for CSOs, better access to EU, or other international, funding and more funds for activities with schools and young people. Firstly, education was singled out as probably the best solution, i.e. the education of citizens, starting from the young through systematic civic education and specialised education, such as media literacy. However, it was pointed out that the effects of education are long-term and take time, so there should be other measures. One national CSO representative suggested that a \u201cpositive propaganda\u201d approach should be employed (in the vein of Germany\u2019s education after WWII) to instil values and democratic attitudes in the population as part of the education measures. Secondly, these were recommendations about pro-active and assertive behaviour of CSOs. To that effect, several CSO activists and experts in Poland recommended that CSOs should be much more active in taking positions on policy issues, in contrast to the current stance of avoiding \u201cpolitical\u201d problems. To that effect, interviewed experts and CSO activists proposed that CSO actions should include providing knowledge and well-argued propositions on important policies. These might include issues such the independence of the judiciary, tackling online and other disinformation (compensating for the deficits in the media sector) and generally starting a \u201ccivic dialogue\u201d with decision- makers and policy-makers, as formulated by a national CSO representative. Thirdly, there were recommendations about real communication campaigns, capacity building to improve communication and cooperation among CSOs themselves, including some of the measures mentioned above such as the \u201ccivic dialogue\u201d. Within this group of measures, a local CSO activist underlined the role of active internet and media campaigns , \u201c speaking to the people \u201d and cooperation with public institutions that should be undertaken as a series of measures by CSOs in dealing with the populism challenge. Cooperation between regional organisations and working with one another was recommended. Receiving and providing communication skills training was underlined as an important measure as this is certainly a disadvantage compared to populist politicians. Support for grassroots organisations at local level, such as women\u2019s rights and pro-democracy youth groups, which are very effective, was underlined in the interviews. ",
        "141 Fourthly, measures to improve funding for CSOs were recommended. It was emphasised that there should be more direct funding available to CSOs to avoid dependence on regional or national authorities. To that effect and concerning the EU level, an interviewed CSO expert underlined the that there was high support for the proposed European Values Instrument and direct EU support for CSOs should be on the list of measures to help CSOs tackle the populist challenge. 8.6. Conclusions and Recommendations for Poland 8.6.1. Factors of populism at national and regional level The most important drivers of populism in Poland are cultural factors, taking precedence over socioeconomic factors. These are cultural anxieties and can be grouped in several sets, including multiculturalism, secularisation and gender equality, with an additional focus on LGBTQI+ rights, the perceived threat from foreign powers, and fear of refugees and Islam. There are different factors at play in the different regions , stemming from historical developments, with the Eastern and Southern part voting for the populist ruling party PiS and the North-West for the main non-populist opposition. There are also differences between bigger cities and smaller towns, the role of the Polish Catholic Church, national values and history, and opposition to the EU and globalisation are important in the regions too. Populism has clearly been identified as a challenge to democracy in Poland , the EU and the current international order. Mainstream parties , according to a CSO representative in Poland, are also considered to have responsibility for the rise of populism due their poor record and low level of trust in them, with unattractive political and economic solutions, thus providing fertile ground in society for the populist parties. Direct democracy is viewed mostly negatively as it turned out that populists could easily manipulate referenda, despite the high hopes vested in it. However, direct democracy can work better at local level as compared to national level but within \u201ca very carefully developed legal environment, which protects the instruments of local democracy\u201d, as one interviewee put it. ",
        "142 Online disinformation has a clear role in the rise of populism, as using social networks made possible the rise of populists and their successes. Two phenomena helped immensely with this process: the full control over public media that is used to broadcast the governing party\u2019s positions and the dire situation of the mainstream media. Neither the public nor the private media can be relied on to effectively counter disinformation campaigns. There is a close link between Euroscepticism and populism and the EU is the main target for populists, who are deeply Eurosceptic. The EU is vilified as a source of evil for the people, threatening cultural and ethnic homogeneity, instilling foreign (i.e. liberal) values and so on, and there is a clash at a symbolic level, too, as EU symbols have been removed from public institutions. At the same time, there is extremely high public support for EU membership in Poland, which constrains populist attacks against the EU as they don\u2019t want to clash with the public. The EU is attempting to limit the effects of populism in the country and the assault on the independent judiciary and liberal democracy in general (e.g. the Article 7 procedure), but the EU should be more assertive in doing so. 8.6.2. Conclusions regarding the role of civil society organisations The main findings of the study are that civil society in Poland is in a financially precarious position, largely dependent on local authorities for funding and with organisations reporting the negative effects of a populist government. CSOs are active socially in both regions but financial problems make it difficult for them to carry out their statutory activities, which address socioeconomic difficulties in the regions. Concerning the populist anti-immigration narrative, services for migrants are particularly difficult to carry out. With regard to direct democracy or increased democratic participation, CSOs in both P\u0142ocki and Nowos\u0105decki are working to facilitate participatory budgeting. 152 CSOs in both regions promote EU values and raise awareness of Poland\u2019s place in Europe. The mapping of the potentially relevant, in terms of activities, CSOs vs. all the other CSOs registered per region, based on the available public, national and regional databases 153 , reveals their limited number in both regions. 152 Participatory budgeting is a democratic process in which community members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget . 153 Sources for Poland in this regard are https://mojepanstwo.pl/ and https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/web/wyszukiwarka-krs/strona- glowna ",

In the P\u0142ocki region of Poland, there were 682 CSOs identified, of which 1.76%, or 12, were deemed to carry out potentially relevant activities: 6 working on European values, 6 on civic education and engagement, 1 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism, 2 on civil liberties and 1 on direct democracy and participation. In Nowos\u0105decki, out of 1,369 CSOs identified, about 1.24%, or 17, were deemed potentially relevant: 8 working on EU values, 8 on civic education and engagement, and 4 on minorities, migrants and multiculturalism. The effectiveness of CSOs is negatively impacted by a lack of financial resources, knowhow and experience, a limited culture of philanthropy, the passivity of citizens and a lack of public awareness, but CSOs also lack the communication skills to effectively counteract populists, who are skilled communicators. Financial problems are particularly acute outside major urban areas, with lower operating budgets, a higher dependence on volunteers and less access to funding. The manifestations of populism in Poland, however, are resulting in a serious erosion of fundamental democratic rights and freedoms, such as the rule of law, which makes it much more difficult for CSOs to counter considering the lack of deep-rooted democratic traditions due to the communist era and a lack of resources. The CSO environment in Poland experienced a substantial deterioration from 2008 to 2017, according to the V-Dem Core Civil Society Index, experiencing the largest drop of all the countries studied \u2013 Austria, France and Italy. The negative environment created by populist politicians is considered a major impediment to the work of CSOs. This includes, not only limited funding, but also preventing people from volunteering for organisations and difficulties carrying out long-term initiatives due to limited resources, as opposed to short term- projects. ",
        "144 The interviewed representatives of civil society formulated some of the challenges as follows: 8.6.3. Recommendations 1 The EU should take a stronger stance in defending democracy in the EU and in Poland as EU membership provides effective leverage against populists and enjoys broad public support. 2 An independent judiciary and media need to be ensured as the basis for tackling populism. 3 Civic education, including media literacy , should be invested in. 4 Civil society should be strengthened through d eveloping knowledge and knowhow on specific policy issues . 5 Local CSOs should be supported through direct EU funding . 6 CSOs should be trained in communication skills in order to effectively counter populists , who are skilled communicators. 7 Participatory methods, such as participatory budgeting , should be developed, especially at local level. 8 Cooperation among regional organisations and stakeholders needs to be fostered. \u201cThe civic sector is concentrated in larger urban areas, which impacts access to funding due to the centralisation of Poland. Local NGOs can only count on funding from local authorities, which can be easy for them to control as local politicians can pick and choose who to fund\u201d. \u201cCSOs are never truly independent as they are intermediaries \u2013 should be engaged in political life. The civic sector is becoming divided between those that share values with the ruling party and those that don\u2019t.\u201d ",
        "145 9. Overall Conclusions and Recommendations This study carried out extensive research into populism in eight non-metropolitan areas in four EU member states. The study used a variety of methods to look into different aspects of this phenomenon and related aspects and elicited proposals to tackle the challenge of populism by different players, but most of all recommendations for CSOs. Populism is indeed a very complex and multifaceted phenomenon, manifested at global, European, national and regional level. There are intense political science expert and public disputes on its causes and effects, common features and specificities, and debates over the necessary approaches to address the root causes and adverse ramifications. This chapter compares the main findings of the study to outline the national and regional idiosyncrasies and commonalities, the European level features and effects and, ultimately, to formulate recommendations for CSOs and other actors to more effectively counter populism. Along with the outcomes from the other methods of research, this chapter\u2019s conclusions and recommendations make extensive use of the insights of the in-depth interviews with CSOs activists, political science experts and focus groups in those regions and countries \u2013 that is, the necessary, valid feedback on these crucial questions. In this chapter, especially, opinions of EU level observers aid the cross-country, European level of analysis. 9.1. Factors of Populism: highlights from the research The key question is whether socioeconomic or cultural factors drive the rise of populism. The research 154 suggests several important conclusions: Depending on the case, some factors are indeed stronger than others and take precedence in driving populism. Poland and Austria, for example, were identified as cases where cultural factors are much stronger, but they were less exposed in the cases of France and Italy compared to socioeconomic factors. Factors for populism may vary across different social groups, such as with middle-income groups, where the fear of loss of status is the strongest factor, while in lower income groups it is the more direct fear of loss of jobs and income. No factor alone causes populism, but rather there is an interplay of factors, which feed on and reinforce each other. For example, the rejection of migration can be due to cultural factors, but also to fear of job losses or job competition. 154 Generally, one of the issues that emerged from the interviews is that the concept of populism is itself not clear, especially to CSOs working in the field, so this prevents them from identifying problems and corresponding solutions. ",
        "146 \u201cAnxieties\u201d and \u201cfears\u201d were often invoked by the CSO activists and political science experts interviewed to explain the rise of populism as populists employ a manipulation of popular fears as their main tactic. For example, an academic expert on populism identified \u201ccultural insecurity\u201d as an explanation for why, in countries where the economic situation is quite good, the rise of populist political forces also exists. Even in cases in which the socioeconomic factors were considered strong, their influence was thought to be indirect and due to economic and financial insecurity. There are differences between the countries as well as between the different regions within the same country \u2013 \u201cgeography\u201d matters. For example, in the north of Italy, populism is considered to be driven by cultural factors, while in the south, socioeconomic factors take precedence. In France, there are the central and peripheral parts of the country. In Poland, voting patterns may reflect the divisions of its historic partitions. In Austria, as in other countries, there was the split, not only in terms of centre-periphery, but also between rural and urban areas. Furthermore, as the citizen surveys indicated, there are regional differences \u2013 for example, in the cases of Italy and France, there are differences in regard to attitudes towards EU membership, migration, authoritarian tendencies and other issues. 155 Last, but not least, there are additional, strong factors that impact the rise of populism related to the very crisis of representative democracy and populism was often identified by political science experts as a long-term danger for liberal democracy, as populists play by the rules to win elections but then seek to change the rules to their advantage. Another academic expert on populism saw populism as \u201c a symptom of deep-rooted challenges facing democracy, an externality of the changing character of political parties and party competition in many European polities in ways that make it increasingly difficult for parties to respond to voters and represent or act on their opinion\u201d. 155 In some cases, the differences in citizens\u2019 perceptions may depend on whether a populist party is in power or in opposition, (as in Poland, Italy or Austria), but further research is necessary to examine it. For example. citizens who support non-populist parties in opposition, may have more populist views \u2013 e.g. higher support for anti-elite attitudes or direct democracy as they see as a way to deal with populists. In Austria, an interviewed activist said that the populist parties supported referenda while in opposition, but once in government opposed them as they were likely to lose them. ",
        "147 This is related to the issue of diminished trust in mainstream parties. Their standing was badly damaged from years of only them being in power and the approximation of party positions, leading to them being indistinguishable to voters or, as one European affairs expert stated, \u201c voters could change parties and leaders but not policies \u201d 156 . This plays into the issue of the responsibility of politicians as people feel unrepresented and abandoned by the mainstream parties. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that mainstream parties have either given up without challenging populists or decided to mimic their tactics, according to the political science experts and CSO activists interviewed. One political science expert pointed to the danger of mainstream parties adopting the language and tactics of populists, especially \u201c traditional conservatives who \u2013 whether in an attempt to compete with the populists, to follow public opinion or because of ideological shifts \u2013 have endorsed a populist rhetoric\u201d . The study found that traditional, mainstream parties are also considered to have a responsibility for the rise of populism as well as for their continuing inaction. As stated by an academic expert of populism in Austria \u201cthe mainstream parties have responsibility for the rise of populism and the populist radical right in the sense that they almost all the time failed to actually address those issues, when they became salient and politicised in the course of an event unfolding. And when they did, they shied away from taking a stand, from taking a position, because they thought it would hurt them.\u201d 156 The expert quoted in the interview Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev. ",
        "148 With regard to the strengths and weaknesses of populist parties , their main strength is \u201ccommunications\u201d, but only in terms of instrumentally using fears and polarising society. In a sense, they sometimes raise the right questions but provide the wrong answers. According to one European affairs observer, interviewed for the study However, communication is also a weakness for populists as their abrasive style and language can be considered repulsive and polarising. Their main weakness, however, according to the several academic experts on populism and CSO activists from the countries in focus, is that they do not have actual solutions or viable plans for policies beyond their shallow rhetoric. The study also analysed three related aspects of populism: direct democracy, online disinformation and Euroscepticism as they received special attention in the research. With regard to direct democracy , the study found that there is clearly a demand for more direct democracy on behalf of citizens (as indicated by the citizen surveys in regard to direct referenda), possibly as a response to the crisis of representative democracy. The political science experts and CSO activists, however, were nearly unanimous in their criticism of direct democracy, saying that, in its current forms, it could create more problems than solutions. This is a clear contradiction that needs to be addressed. The possible solutions, according to those interviewed, can be found in deliberative mechanisms, carefully prepared referenda with informed debate and clear questions and outcomes, especially at local level, a well-informed public and long-nurtured culture of direct democracy. There was also stronger approval for direct democracy mechanisms at local level due to the proximity between authorities and people, the \u201c democracy of proximity \u201d as one official defined it. An expert in populism with knowledge on European affairs said that \u201c...populists, generally, and almost by definition, are good at reflecting people\u2019s anxieties. And they\u2019re not incommoded often by worries of being accurate, fair and transparent. They want to vent anger and frustration. Brexit is the caricature of venting people\u2019s frustrations but having absolutely no answers on how to conduct things .\u201d \u201c There is no good participation without deliberation. And there is no good deliberation without a significant effort to create the conditions for a good deliberation .\u201d ",
        "149 The role of online disinformation was considered closely related to populism, and clearly contributing to its rise \u2013 for example, populists make use of the advantages of social and online media to spread their messages and, on the back of a crisis of traditional media, this is a very successful move. The quick cycle of news, polarisation and encapsulation through echo chambers works to their advantage. One European expert with experience on media outlined two specific problems: Euroscepticism is another related aspect, as populists have a strong relation to it. According to the opinion of one European expert in public affairs : \u201cThe first aspect, which is specific to the online environment, is the amplification (through algorithms, etc.) which gives a lot more visibility to these fake news. There is a range of things that need to be done: restoring trust in the media, showing the difference, tools to limit the amplification and the spread, trust indicators, fact-checking, media literacy, all sorts of tools... The second factor behind disinformation is a recent challenge of \u201cl\u2019esprit des Lumi\u00e8res\u201d, of the notion of scientific progress, of reason.\u201d \u201c To a large extent, EU/Euro-critical attitudes among citizens stem from widespread disappointment with the lack of effective reactions, let alone solutions, rightly or not pinned on Brussels to the mounting and overlapping troubles confronting Europe \u2013 most notably, the increase of (illegal) migration, a spate of terrorist attacks, and ongoing economic and social woes.\u201d ",
        "150 9.2. The role of civil society organisations: highlights from the research The overall conclusion based on the desk research of the civil society organisations in the regions identifies that CSOs providing social services on behalf of the state/municipalities are well represented. There are some examples of civic initiatives in support of migrants, and efforts to tackle online disinformation and support direct democracy, such as participatory budgeting. Euroscepticism is, by and large, not addressed, with the exception of Poland where support for the EU is high. The mapping of CSOs active in the areas of promoting EU values, civic education and engagement, civil liberties, direct democracy, support to minorities, refugees and migrants and tackling online disinformation, which was conducted in the regions based on official information sources specifically for the study, reveals a marginal number of CSOs implementing activities that can potentially tackle populism. The lowest percentage is in France. Table 19.

",
        "151 The findings of the field research (interviews and focus groups) confirms the lack of encompassing and comprehensive civil society initiatives in tackling populism due to a variety of reasons: the complexity of the phenomenon, which needs further understanding, the shrinking civic space, which includes both a lack of an enabling environment in which CSOs can operate, limited human resources (many of the organisations are almost entirely reliant on volunteers), reduced funding and lack of expertise. The need for civil society to be supported in non-metropolitan regions in terms of resources, knowledge, expertise and knowhow has been identified as a prerequisite in order to empower CSOs to have capacity to: \u2022 raise awareness of the specificities of the populist phenomenon in the regions and devise effective strategies to address its roots and manifestations ; \u2022 give voice to and advocate for those who are underrepresented or in an underprivileged position ; \u2022 lead the development of a public sphere for debate at local level ; \u2022 foster the development of cooperation and networks both across regions and countries and at different levels (local, national, European) and among different stakeholders; \u2022 monitor and challenge the policy solutions proposed by populists ; \u2022 support the elaboration of policy solutions to citizens\u2019 problems and concerns that have not, to date, been addressed by mainstream politicians and are exploited by populists; \u2022 implement initiatives related to informal civic education and active citizenship ; \u2022 tackle online disinformation ; \u2022 promote European values and the essential ingredients of a healthy democracy 9.3. Positive examples of CSOs initiatives in countering populism Although one of the research objectives of the study was the identification of good practices of CSOs in, countering populism in the regions, such practices, defined as civic initiatives with a sustainable impact were not identified through the desk research or the interviews and focus groups. Some positive examples of CSO initiatives with the potential to be upscaled are presented below as the organisations were identified and shared their views and work through the interviews conducted. ",
        "152 This report chose to present the following three different examples from three of the countries in focus: Agenzia di Promozione Integrata per i Cittadini in Europa (APICE), based in the Reggio di Calabria region of Italy, is a youth organisation with members all under 35 years old, mostly based in the central and southern parts of Italy. APICE\u2019s actions are aimed at preventing, combating, and reporting hate speech online and offline as a contribution to tackling populism. They initiated the Italian campaign and coordinate the national network of young people , which is active in promoting human rights online and combating the different forms of hatred and discrimination that lead to violence, radicalisation, and violations of human rights. It began as part of the Council of Europe\u2019s \u201cno hate speech\u201d campaign, but is now youth-led and active in different countries. As a corollary, APICE is addressing the related phenomenon of online disinformation , which, according to their observation, \u201cinitially was an isolated way to create disinformation, but is now becoming a systematic organised way to manipulate information. The closer the European elections of 2019, the more serious issue this is becoming\u201d. APICE\u2019s actions include: - Prevention : human rights education, media literacy through educational tools and specific educational activities to combat disinformation: how to recognise them, how to react to them online and how to build a positive and reliable narrative online. - Reporting online hate comments to the national authorities and advocating for a clear codification of the phenomenon across borders as hate speech is subject to different legislation in different countries. - Producing counter narratives online against hate speech and disinformation. The organisation produces content, such as videos, that can reverse the oppressive narrative found in hateful comments. By developing alternative narratives, they aim to change the approach to stereotypes in general discussions and pursue changes to public discourse. ",
        "153 Les Jeunes Europ\u00e9ens France (Young Europeans France) is the French national branch of the Young European Federalists 157 . They target the negative aspects of populism by addressing Europhobic or Eurosceptic speeches, especially of political parties or candidates. They also organise street actions and they plan to take positions and argue against populists during the 2019 campaign for the European elections. The organisation has witnessed an increase in new members and activity in recent times, especially after Brexit, which served as a shock for young people, who realised that the EU is a benefit that is under threat from populists. Examples of their initiatives are: - The campaign \u201c Europe en mieux\u201d (Better Europe) launched in 2015 in France, a joint initiative of the Young Europeans, the European Movement and the Union of European Federalists through which they challenged Eurosceptic positions, including through carrying out conferences and debate-caf\u00e9s. - Their programme \u201c Europe par les Jeunes\u201d (Europe by the Youth) is the most important initiative in tackling Euroscepticism and populism in general. It involves public awareness and educational activities. \u201cEurope par les Jeunes\u201d (formerly called \u201cEurope at school\u201d) is an educational programme that consists of presenting Europe and the European union to pupils and students in schools at all levels 157 It should be noted that the organisation does not have representation in any of the French regions in focus. This is instructive as according to them the fact that they did not manage to establish there and have any meaningful actions (primary school, middle school, high school), as well as in extracurricular structures (e.g. social and recreation centres). More than 300 interventions were carried out last year among 10,000 young people in France 158 . - Initiatives such as \u201cEurope en Vacances\u201d (Europe in Holidays) http://www.europeenvacances.eu/fr is about meeting citizens directly on the ground to raise awareness of Europe among audiences that are sometimes very distant. In terms of public awareness, they consider this to be a success and an efficient activity with a real impact. - Their publication Le Taurillon (https://www.taurillon.org/) is an online magazine with local printed editions in several cities in France. It is the main outlet to respond, refute and argue against parties or politicians who take populist positions (including on rule of law in Poland and Brexit). It also tackles online disinformation and fake news. contributes even more to the distancing of rural areas\u2019 inhabitants from European citizenship and European thematic areas. 158 https://www.jeunes-europeens.org/Europe-par-les-Jeunes ",
        "154 The CSO experiences in Austria in working with refugees include: Caritas initiatives in arts to tackle the populist discourse Caritas is one of the \u201cbig five\u201d welfare organisations (along with Diakonie, Hilfswerk, Rote Kreuze and Volkshilfe), which are active in Austria in working with refugees 159 , including in the regions in focus of Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. Caritas have implemented art projects with refugees, such as dancing (Tanz die Toleranz), drawing and painting, with the results presented on social media as a way of communicating with citizens and changing attitudes despite the risk of racist backlash on the internet. Caritas also has a project called ZusammenReden (talking together) that offers training for school pupils, teachers and other CSOs to counter the populist language known as \u201cStammtischparolen\u201d (which can be translated as bumper sticker wisdom, or the talk of drunken people in bars that is often related to foreigners). Sport with refugees An example of the success that CSOs can have in countering anti-migrant narratives is the \u201cSports with Refugees\u201d project, originally funded by the International Olympic Committee, which has resulted in 167 refugees currently being integrated into 155 sport clubs in Carinthia. Anecdotal evidence of the effect of sports for integration and consequent changes in public attitudes was confirmed at the focus group in Klagenfurt as one participant recalled refugees integrated in the local football clubs. According to this testimony, they felt very welcome because most of the other players showed friendly behaviour to them, saying \u201cFootball connects people, no matter who they are and where they come from\u201d. 159 Caritas works with local governments to provide social services, help and advice in financial and social emergencies, counselling and therapy, shelter and housing, work and employment, asylum, migration, and integration, care and maintenance.

        "155 9.4. Recommendations 1. Develop a knowledge base on \u201cpopulism\u201d to inform a tailored approach to tackling its roots and manifestations Justification : Many of the interviewees in the regions reported that the term \u201cpopulism\u201d is not clear to them and it is not recognised as a distinctive type of challenge. While the report identifies some common features, it also demonstrates that different factors are at play in the different regions, which predetermines its different outcomes. Developing an in-depth knowledge on the specificities of the phenomenon and a blueprint (strategic framework) for tackling populism is, therefore, a necessary basis for devising tailor- made strategies that work at local level. Concrete actions: research, analysis, training, public awareness Actors involved: all interested stakeholders: politicians, academia, CSOs, media Levels concerned: mainly regional, also national 2. Foster EU communication and engagement Justification : The study shows that EU achievements are not visible at regional and local level. At the same time, the European project has the potential to tackle populism because of its international nature. It is up to the EU, therefore, to demonstrate that it is \u201cpart of the solution\u201d, as put forward by a European expert in public affairs, rather than part of the problem, as claimed by populists. Concrete actions : awareness raising campaigns, local debates and informational activities Actors involved: EU institutions in cooperation with local stakeholders Levels concerned: local, national and EU levels 3. Restore the public sphere of dialogue and discussion Justification : The collapse of structures for debates around social issues and social bonds in local communities, in combination with the passivity of the traditional parties in reaching out to rural areas, creates feelings of abandonment and disconnect among citizens, which are exploited by populists. The restoration of the public sphere and the civic space is one of the ways of shrinking the space for populism. Concrete actions: create an infrastructure for debate, discussion and engagement Actors involved: all interested stakeholders \u2013 CSOs, businesses, academia and politicians Levels concerned: local level ",
        "156 4. Complement representative democracy with collaborative elements of participatory democracy Justification : The study shows a very high level of support among citizens for direct democracy while the experts interviewed were cautious, warning against serious drawbacks, especially regarding referenda. With representative democracy in crisis, as defined by one of the European experts in public affairs and populism interviewed 160 , and a new deliberative-collaborative model of democracy emerging worldwide, there are initiatives that can be implemented as complementary to the current model of representative democracy in order to strengthen it by reducing the gap between political elites and citizens and transforming their relationship into more of a partnership. Concrete actions: crowdsourcing citizens\u2019 ideas for policy solutions, participatory budgeting, etc. Actors involved: politicians, CSOs, citizens Levels concerned: especially at local level, but also at national and European level 5. Strengthen the EU\u2019s role and actions as guardian of EU values and democracy in the EU and in Member States Justification : The different factors determining the different \u201cfaces\u201d of populism in the different countries and regions are rooted in the historical development of the Member States. As defined by one of the European experts in public affairs and populism interviewed, the East-West divide has, as an outcome, the fact that disaffection with representative democracy in the East results in \u201can alternative which people see more in authoritarian regimes \u2013 leave the matters in the hands of a stronger government, whereas in Western democracies it\u2019s more \u201cwe citizens want to be involved more, to participate more\u201d\u201d. At the same time, in the post-communist countries where democracy is still very fragile, EU membership provides effective leverage against populists and enjoys broad public support, as demonstrated by the research on Poland. Citizens do expect a firmer stance on behalf of the EU in defending fundamental rights and freedoms that are under attack from populists in these countries. Concrete actions: debates and resolutions, infringement procedures, invocation of article 7 if needed. Actors involved: EU institutions and national decision-makers Levels concerned: EU, national 160 The populists \u201care not a challenge as such but a reminder that we have a bigger structural problem on our hands, which won\u2019t just go away. To ruin the appeal of populists, you have to solve the crisis of representative democracy, you have to re-empower the people\u201d. ",
        "157 6. Provoke traditional parties to innovate and seek new solutions to citizens\u2019 concerns exploited by populists Justification : In all the regions studied, interviewees and participants in focus groups articulated the responsibility of the traditional parties for the populists\u2019 expansion. As one of the European experts interviewed defined it, \u201c political parties are extremely shallow in their ability to think \u2026 They don\u2019t really push for investing in new ideas, and they often kill new ideas, because they\u2019re challenging their position \u201d. At the same time, the weakest point of populists, according to the study, is the fact that populists, as formulated by another European expert, \u201c have shown limited transformative power in terms of their ability to determine actual policy choices \u201d. Reconquering the territory of ideas and policy solutions to real problems, therefore, is a tangible strategy for countering populism. Concrete actions: debates and engagement activities to identify actual citizens\u2019 needs and concerns. Brainstorming with different stakeholders and soliciting the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d on possible policy solutions. Actors involved: politicians, citizens, CSOs, businesses, academics Levels concerned: local and national 7. Support civil society at local level Justification : The study identifies the very weak civil society response to the \u201cpopulist\u201d phenomenon in the non-metropolitan regions studied due to a variety of reasons: complexity of the phenomenon, lack of an enabling environment \u2013 shrinking civic space, lack of resources \u2013 insufficient financial and human resources, a lack of knowhow and communication skills, isolation and marginalisation, etc. Concrete and consistent actions over time are needed in order to empower civil society organisations in those regions to deliver their mission and play their role of \u201cspeaking on behalf of those who are underrepresented and advocating for the marginalised, and to educate and create a kind of genuine bond between different communities\u201d as recommended by a European expert in public affairs and international CSO representative interviewed. Concrete actions: - Ensure independent funding from populist governments and players; - Provide training and knowledge building on \u201cpopulism\u201d, online disinformation, communication and advocacy skills development. Actors involved: EU institutions, European civil society networks, local CSOs Levels concerned: local, national and European with a supportive role ",
        "158 8. Tackle online disinformation at all levels Justification : Online disinformation has been identified in the study as a very important tool of spreading populism by all those interviewed and surveyed at all levels. While it seems difficult to articulate a concrete strategy for dealing with this multifaceted problem, there is a high level of recognition of its importance for sustaining democracy and of the need for a consistent and coordinated approach at all levels. There is some expectation that the EU should lead the battle to counter it or at least provide a blueprint. Concrete actions: elaborate a consistent multilevel strategy and an action plan; training on the implementation of concrete actions (e.g. fact checking and media literacy), work on civic education Actors involved: all stakeholders Levels concerned: local, national, EU level 9. Invest in formal and informal civic education Justification : The need to boost civic education was identified in all regions and at all levels. This includes education on active citizenship, democracy, the EU and national competencies, populism, online disinformation, EU fundamental rights and values and, especially, respect for minorities and their role in an inclusive democratic society, which has been undermined by populists. Concrete actions: develop and implement civic education curricula in schools as part of the formal education process and support informal civic education in communities through CSOs and other stakeholders. Actors involved: Governments, educational institutions, CSOs, European institutions and CSO networks Levels concerned: local and national 10. Boost internationalisation/Europeanisation through exchanges \u2013 horizontal, vertical and multi-stakeholder involving non-metropolitan areas Justification : Isolation works in populists\u2019 favour as it exploits fears of the unknown and of those who are different from us. Internationalisation and Europeanisation broadens horizons and fosters the acceptance of \u201cothers\u201d through personal experience. Concrete actions: exchange schemes, networking and collaboration development between different regions, especially with similar problems across borders and between different levels, as well as between different stakeholders Actors involved: CSOs, businesses, media, non-populist politicians Levels concerned: local, regional, national, European, cross-border ",

The comparison across time (Figure 1) between populist vote shares in the period 2008-2018 for each region shows a general upward trend from 2010-2011 onwards. For Klagenfurt-Villach (KV) and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (NS) in Austria, there was actually a decrease from 2008 to 2010, followed by an increase and then another drop in 2016. The two Polish regions, P\u0142ocki (PL) and Nowos\u0105decki (NW), also show similar patterns of relative decline in populist support in 2011, followed by an upward trend. The data for Aisne and Dr\u00f4me in France demonstrates similar patterns, with an increase from 2012 onwards. In the case of the two Italian regions, there is a gradual trend upwards in populist support throughout the period. 4 For sources and further details, please see the chapter \u201cOverview of factors for populism at national and regional level in the countries in focus\u201d.

        "164 The comparison between the wealth of a region and populist voting patterns across the different countries and different regions provides several interesting results (Figure 2). In the cases of France, Austria and, especially, Poland, support for populists (as mean populist vote share between 2008 and 2018) is clearly stronger in the poorer regions (as measured by GDP per capita in PPS) compared to the wealthier regions and the national level. Still, support for populist parties in the wealthier non- metropolitan areas was higher than the national level. Italy demonstrated a different pattern, as populist support was lowest in the poorest region and at similar levels in the wealthier region and the national level. Hence, the wealth of a region in terms of GDP per capita in PPS cannot explain support for populists in all cases and all countries, so other factors need to be explored. 10.4. Appendix 4.

Can you rank the top 3 to 5 most important ones? 2. Are there different factors at play in the different [regions of the country \u2013 for country political science experts] [countries in Europe \u2013 for Europe political science experts] or they are more or less similar? Can you give examples of what issues drive populism more strongly? 3. According to you, how do populist parties rank as a challenge \u2013 compared to other challenges \u2013 for the countries in Europe and the EU as a whole? In what sense they can be considered as a challenge, e.g. to liberal democracy, rule of law, common EU institutions, economy, current international order or other aspects? ",

E.g. in case populist sentiments might be more widespread, but electoral support for them is much lower, what would be the explanation? 5. Even if you, or most people in general, disagree with populist parties, do you think populists have a point in some cases? Can you give examples? 6. What do you think about the responsibility of politicians \u2013 populist and mainstream? According to you, to what extent is the success of populism due to underlying factors and to what extent is it due to the poor shape of mainstream parties and instrumental campaigning by populist parties? I.e. what is the role of political rhetoric and polarisations of society? 7. We would like to know your opinion about three issues, often associated with populism? As these are indeed complex issues, please feel free to just very briefly share your take on them? \u25aa What about the calls for more \u201cdirect democracy\u201d such as referendums to be used more often \u2013 as opposed to current representative democracy? Are there merits in adopting more of them \u2013 and which ones? Will it work at both local and national level (or European scale), i.e. considering there are differences of scale? \u25aa What do you think about the role of online disinformation for the rise of populism? What is the role of social media? What is the role of traditional media \u2013 and is there a difference between local and national media? What can be done to limit the effects of online disinformation and, in general, so-called \u201cfake news\u201d? \u25aa According to you, how is populism related to Euroscepticism ? What is the most serious challenge posed to the European project? What can be done on [regional and national \u2013 for country political science experts] [country and European \u2013 for European political science experts] to tackle the most negative aspects, including by European CSOs and EU institutions? 8. According to you, which are the most important measures necessary to address the populist challenge? If you have to choose only 3 to 5 measures, what would they be and in what order should they be carried out? E.g. it can be assumed that the measures to tackle the populist challenge can be broadly divided in two groups: \u25aa Dealing with socioeconomic issues, such as inequality, unemployment, poverty, poor social services, etc. \u25aa Dealing with other associated phenomena, such as fighting xenophobia, racism and sexism, distrust in democracy and institutions with calls for more direct democracy, fake news and disinformation (on social media and traditional media), Euroscepticism ",

How would you assign responsibility for these measures at different levels \u2013 local/regional, national and European (if applicable)? Could you be more specific about what can be done at European level to tackle the negative effects of populist parties, in regard to both legitimate resentments and political manipulation? 10. Do you have observations about how populist politicians change once they are in power, i.e. does this moderate or amplify (a) their positions and (b) public support for them? Respectively, what works best in mitigating the populist challenge \u2013 confrontation or cooperation, ignoring them? E.g. should populist parties be treated as any other party? 11. According to you, what else should be addressed in the debates on populism? What aspect of populism is being neglected in current discussions? As the study focuses on CSOs, there are several questions below that refer to CSO activities. If you are not familiar with the topic, please feel free to skip these questions. 12. Are you aware of organisations and initiatives that are working to tackle these negative aspects of populism at [local, regional level \u2013 for country political science experts] [national and European level - for European political science experts]? What is the situation is now, have they been successful? Please, consider both: \u25aa Specific programmes and actions of CSOs targeted at populism \u25aa Strategies of CSOs to tackle populism The examples from CSOs include issues such as the following: public awareness, involving famous people to dispel negative attitudes, media literacy education to fight disinformation. An example of unsuccessful approach has been CSOs reporting failure to work with and convince populist politicians. 13. According to you, what are the most serious impediments for CSOs, which are tackling populist challenges respectively at [local, regional level \u2013 for country political science experts] [national and European level - for European political science experts]? Please, comment also on the lack of resources (human, financial), knowhow and political science expertise? ",
        "167 For example, other CSOs in different countries have reported a number of problems, including negative campaigning against them, limiting their access to public funding, changing the law in order to put pressure on/persecute them, etc.? 14.

How would you rate them from the most urgent steps to specific programmes and longer- term strategies? What are the valuable allies and what should they do to help CSOs and citizens? Some problems that give rise to populism are of course too complex for CSOs to tackle alone. But if you had to make recommendations to CSOs and activists what would be the initiatives, the necessary steps, the allies (e.g. other NGOs, local-national-EU institutions, media, etc.) and the resources (in a broader sense) to most effectively tackle the negative aspects of populism? 15. What are the necessary resources to implement these specific programmes and strategies of CSOs as well as to boost the effectiveness of existing ones, which you mentioned? Please, consider political science expertise and knowhow, human and financial resources, etc. You can also target your recommendations at different levels \u2013 regional, national and European \u2013 for the need of resources for CSOs? 16.

Comparison across the eight regions: the eight regions compared on key aspects of populism This section presents a comparison between the eight regions in focus in this study across eight key questions of the citizen surveys 5 conducted for the purposes of the study. The eight questions include anti-elitist sentiments, authoritarian and majoritarian tendencies, attitudes towards migration, religion as a marker of national identity, opinion about EU membership and the sovereignty debate in the context if EU membership. The results of these comparisons show that there are differences between the countries as well as between the regions within the countries on different topics (see the graphs and text below for specific percentages). The two regions in Poland are among those with the highest support for direct referenda, strong leaders, majoritarianism and religion as an essential part of national identity . However, they have among the highest support for EU membership and low anti-elitist sentiments compared to the other regions. The two regions of Italy have strong anti-elitist sentiments, but are quite different in other aspects \u2013 Udine is strongly anti-elitist, but has low support for referenda and majoritarianism and a relatively high approval for migration and the EU. Aisne and Dr\u00f4me , in France , are similar in regard to anti-elitism (relatively high), referenda, majoritarianism, religion and identity as well as sovereignty , but differ on migration as there is a more favourable attitude towards it in Dr\u00f4me. The EU, too, has much higher support in Dr\u00f4me. 5 The citizen surveys were conducted in all eight regions in focus for the purposes of this study, using a closed-ended questionnaire. For further details and the methodology, please see the national chapters in this report. The regions in Austria are similar to each other in that they have lower levels of anti-elitism, support for referenda, approval of strong leaders and majoritarian sentiment compared to the other regions, and relatively high disapproval of EU membership , but differ on migration , with Klagenfurt-Villach opposing it and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd showing more approval compared to the other regions. Furthermore, respondents in Klagenfurt-Villach were more inclined to see Catholicism as a key part of national identity , whereas the opposite is true of Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd. Respondents from the two regions in Italy expressed the highest levels of anti-elitist sentiment (Figure 3), agreeing more than the other regions with the statement \u201cPoliticians are from a different socioeconomic class to other citizens\u201d. Udine has the highest agreement in this regard (62%) followed by Reggio di Calabria (60%) Aisne and Dr\u00f4me in France (57% and 56%, respectively) and the Austrian regions of Klagenfurt-Villach and Nieder\u00f6sterreich-S\u00fcd (both 43%). Respondents in Poland were least inclined to approve of this statement, with 39% showing agreement in P\u0142ocki and 30% in Nowos\u0105decki.

        "184 10.9. Appendix 9. CSO Typologies and developments in Austria at national level Civil society in Austria is based around the political, sectoral and federal structures, with organisations operating autonomously from their national or regional counterparts within the different federal states. 7 There are different legal bases for CSOs to operate, but they tend to form as cooperatives, associations (including clubs and societies) and foundations. Since cooperatives and foundations tend to operate outside of civil society \u2013 in 2010, only 95 out of 1,817 cooperatives and 20% of all foundations could be considered charitable or non-profit \u2013 civil society is primarily composed of associations 8 . This picture, however, is incomplete as non-profit public limited companies, cooperatives or limited liability companies are not recorded in the statistics 9 . In 2010 there were 116,556 registered CSOs in Austria 10 , but this is the latest available figure. Only 11,000 (10%) CSOs have at least one employee and 46% of those aged 15 or over do volunteering of some form 11 . In 2014, the majority of organisations in disaster relief, culture, the environment, community work and sport had no full-time workers 12 . On the other hand, a majority of paid employees work in social welfare, special interest groups, religious organisations and education, although the statistical data is incomplete. In terms of funding, public authorities contribute 53%, market revenues 33% and sponsorship and donations 11% 13 , although public funding may be as high as 59.5% for CSOs providing social services. In 2010, the civil society sector was divided into 43% social services, 23% education, 18% culture and art, 15% healthcare, 11% development and humanitarian aid, 10% sport and leisure, 9% interest activities, 6% research and science, 4% environment, 4% housing and labour and 7% others 14 . 7 http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf 8 Ibid. 9 Ibid. 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid. 12 https://www.sozialministerium.at/cms/site/attachments/1/4/3/CH3434/CMS1451900458557/soziale-themen_freiwilliges- engagement_bericht-zur-lage-und-zu-den-perspektiven-des-freiwilligen-engagements-in-oesterreich.pdf 13 http://gemeinnuetzig.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Austria_CSI_RA_final_en.pdf 14 The study looked at associations ( verein ), foundations ( stiftung ), public benefit organisations ( gemeinn\u00fctzige Kapitalgesellschaft ) and cooperatives ( Genossenschaft ).

        "200 10.12. Appendix 12. CSO typologies and developments at national level in France There were around 1,500,000 registered non-profit organisations in France in 2017. In 2015, according to Eurostat, 46% of people aged 16 or over were involved in voluntary activities and 86-88% of organisations in France work only with volunteers, although the number of salaried employees grew by over 6% between 2008 and 2016. Over the same period, payroll rose by over 20%, which indicates both an increasing financial burden on CSOs and a need to professionalise, for the reasons outlined above. At the same time, the number of organisations grew by only 3%. 17 Overall in France, 46% of employees are concentrated in 5% of the organisations (those with 50+ employees) and 36% in the 18% of organisations that have 10-49 employees, which means that 82% of employees are in 23% of the organisations. This is particularly the case in organisations active in socio-sanitary sectors where employees are heavily concentrated in larger organisations. 18 17 https://www.associations.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/france_associative_en_mouvement_2017.pdf 18 Ibid. 19 European Audiovisual Observatory (2016) Mapping of media literacy practices and actions in EU-28. Strasbourg. France has a very active media literacy landscape, featuring around 55 key stakeholders, 22 of which are CSOs. A high proportion of stakeholders are said to have a statutory duty to engage in media literacy projects, either due to legal obligations, contractual obligations, or because all of their activities are related to media literacy. There is also a strong approach from the public authorities, as national education reform in 2013 introduced information and media literacy as a core task of schools. The \u201cInvestment Program for the Future\u201d will fund \u201cthe great school for digital\u201d, which is dedicated to projects training unemployed young people, and \u201cdigital plan\u201d, which is focused on school equipment, such as digital tablets, and teacher training. This increasing implementation of media literacy projects is linked to an apparent increase in the dissemination of conspiracy theories, hate speech, bullying and harassment, in part following the 2015 terrorist attacks 19 .

This could become more of a challenge for local, less wealthy organisations since membership of these organisations has declined, from 40 per organisation in 2007 to 30 per organisation in 2015. Since around only half of members actively participate in an organisation and paying employees is too expensive, many are forced to look for volunteers to fill the gap. Around 45% of organisations are based solely on volunteering and employ people through various means, such as permanent contracts, contract work, and other forms of agreement. Regular employment is most commonly found in social services and assistance, healthcare and local development, and is much more common in large urban areas than in peripheral or rural areas. Overall, the scale of employment in civil society is quite low. Average revenues of Polish CSOs have increased since 2011, from EUR 4,180 in 2011 to EUR 6,280 in 2014, although this could be due to the disappearance of ",
        "234 CSOs with the smallest budgets (fewer than EUR 230 per annum), which declined from 20% to 14%. Social services and assistance organisations have the highest budgets, followed by healthcare and education, local development, sport, leisure, tourism and recreation, and culture. There are also big differences in income between rural and urban areas. The average income of organisations in rural areas in 2014 was EUR 3,955, increasing to EUR 5,120 in places with 50,000 people, EUR 16,000 in places with 200,000 people and EUR 21,900 in Warsaw. More established organisations also tend to have larger budgets. In 2014, the main sources of income were membership fees, used by 60% of organisations, local government 55%, private donations 45% and institutional donations 35%, but in terms of total revenue, the EU accounted for 23% of income, local and central government 15% each, and private donations 9%. 10.19. Appendix 19. Party affiliation and key questions on populism in Poland 28 Concerning anti-elite sentiments, a significant share of respondents from the Nowos\u0105decki region (44%) disagree with the statement that \u201cPoliticians are from a different socioeconomic class to other citizens\u201d with 30% agreeing with it. Non-populist voters \u2013 59% for Civic Platform \u2013 oppose the position to a larger extent than do populist voters (PiS, Kukiz\u201915). The supporters of such parties also have a larger share of disagreement, with 45% of voters of the ruling PiS opposing the position and 33% in agreement (Appendix 19, Figures 1 and 2). Appendix 19. Figure 1 Appendix 19. Figure 2 28 Zero percentage (\u201c0%\u201d) in the graphs of citizen surveys means that the share of respondents who answered or the share of answers to \u0430 particular choice within \u0430 multi-choice question is zero, i.e. no respondent responded to the question or pointed to a choice in the multi-choice questions. A multi-choice question is for example Strongly disagree \u2013 Disagree - Neither agree nor disagree - Agree- Strongly agree (i.e. Linkert scale). ",
        "235 With regard to direct democracy, the majority of respondents in the Nowos\u0105decki region (77%) strongly agree that the most important decisions should be made through direct referenda. Non-voters, populists and non-populists alike support the statement, although those of the governing PiS to a lesser extent (70%). Greater opposition to referenda comes from voters of the smaller parties, but even they are split 50-50 on the issue. In P\u0142ocki, the highest support for direct referenda can be found among PO voters (83%), PSL voters (77%), non-voters (69%) and Kukiz\u201915 (50%). Those against it are among the unaffiliated (34%), other small parties (20%) and PiS (19%) ( Appendix 19 : Figures 3 and 4 ). Appendix 19. Figure 3 ",

It seems that supporters of non-government parties \u2013 regardless of whether they are populist or not \u2013 do not agree with it (non-populists) and/or are undecided (opposition populists). Civic Platform voters in the P\u0142ocki region reject it by 69%. Only among the governing populist PiS party is there support for a strong leader \u2013 51% against 38% who oppose it. There is relatively high support among non-voters, too, for a strong leader, with 34% in favour, 19% opposing and 38% undecided. Support for a strong leader who can act against democratic checks and balances is supported by 31% of respondents in the Nowos\u0105decki region respondents and is opposed by 46%. The highest support is among the ruling PiS party (43%), with 38% against. The voters of another populist party, but which is in opposition \u2013 Kukiz 15 \u2013 are divided, in equal measure, in support and opposition to strong leadership \u2013 26% apiece. It is interesting to note that non-voters are in the same position with 38% supporting and 38% opposing the suggestion. Civic Platform voters oppose it with 48% against 24% who support the position.

The vast majority of respondents in P\u0142ocki (74%) and Nowos\u0105decki (61%) disagree with the proposition and just 17% and 21%, respectively, agree. In terms of party preferences, in the P\u0142ocki region the supporters of the ruling PiS tend to have higher support for curbing civil liberties (25%), with a similar share of undecided respondents (25%), but the rest (50%) are against it.

Voters of the populist Kukiz\u201915 are also, almost unanimously, against the proposition. In Nowos\u0105decki, a third of PiS voters support the notion of limiting civil liberties, 46% are against and 23% undecided.

Supporters of ruling PiS party and, to a greater extent, non-voters reject this notion in the highest degree \u2013 57% and 63% respectively. It is worth noting that most of the voters of the non-populist Civic Platform are undecided, with 47% and only 33% in support. Voters of the opposition populist Kukiz\u201915 are also largely undecided (50%), but with a high level of disagreement (38%). In the P\u0142ocki region, the benefits of migration are supported most of all by the respondents of other, smaller parties (60%) and PO voters (34%).

Constructing the Populism Index of selected parties in Austria, France, Italy and Poland The study constructed a Populism Index of selected parties in Austria, France, Italy and Poland for the purposes of the research. Using the 2014 and 2017 Chapel Hill Expert Surveys (CHES) 30 , the study looked at anti-elitism, authoritarianism, majoritarianism and cultural openness (that is, the extent to which they are mono- or multi-cultural) as aspects of populism, as well as assessed whether Euroscepticism is an additional facet of populism in the eight regions. The degree to which populist political parties reflect these different aspects of populism pointed to the nature of populism in the regions and served as a useful tool for understanding whether voters\u2019 choices reflect these same values. The CHES 31 asks political scientists specialising in political parties and European integration to assess party positions in terms of political ideology, European integration and various policy areas. These expert views are cross- validated with alternative sources of information on party positioning, including the Manifesto Project Database, which analyses parties\u2019 election manifestoes to study policy preferences 32 .

Anti-elitism was measured according to the salience of anti-elite and anti- establishment rhetoric. Majoritarianism was assessed by attitudes towards the rights of ethnic minorities. Authoritarianism was measured by positions towards civil liberties, individual rights and freedoms and direct vs. representative democracy. Cultural openness was scored according to positions towards immigration, multiculturalism and nationalism (the \u2018Nationalism\u2019 variable was used for Austria instead of \u2018GALTAN_NEW\u2019).
