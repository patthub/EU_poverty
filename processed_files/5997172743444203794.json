        "G. whereas the Commission has agreed to provide EUR 137 million for short-term needs and at least EUR 200 million for the medium and longer term, with Member States providing an additional EUR 92 million, H. whereas Haiti is crippled by foreign debt, estimated at approximately USD 1 billion, which was an obstacle to its development even before the earthquake and may hinder the country\u2019s recovery effort, I. whereas the immediate rebuilding of the Haitian capacity for a functioning democracy and government is an essential part of moving from providing the first phase of emergency aid towards the considerable task of rebuilding the nation, 1.

Urges that EU priority be given to assisting with the reconstruction efforts and improving the humani\u00ad tarian situation, focusing on vulnerable groups, such as women and children, and on providing shelter, medical facilities, logistical assistance and food; calls on all Member States to be prepared to meet UN requests for further assistance; 5. Expresses grave concern about the welfare of the vulnerable, particularly women; calls on the Commission and the UN to pay special attention to women's participation in reconstruction efforts by actively involving them in the rehabilitation, reconstruction and evaluation phases of all relief and rebuilding programmes; 6. Stresses that unaccompanied and separated children should be provided with services aimed at reuniting them with their parents or customary care-givers as quickly as possible; calls on the EU and the international community urgently to assess the need for a coordinated plan to deal with the thousands of children left orphaned by the earthquake; highlights the grave risk of human trafficking incidents; 7. Urges the EU to support a temporary moratorium on new adoptions of children from Haiti for up to two years after tracing efforts have begun; calls for EU efforts to provide children with their basic needs, to bring temporary schools into operation and to provide counselling to children as a matter of urgency; 8. Welcomes the Commission's preliminary commitments to EUR 30 million in humanitarian assistance but expresses concern that the Haiti Flash Appeal launched by the OCHA for USD 575 million is 87 % funded in terms of contributions; emphasises that such funding is crucial for sustaining operations in the long term; calls on the Commission and all Member States to fully honour the commitments they have made; 9. Welcomes the decision by the G7 countries to cancel their claims on Haiti's international debt; expects all countries and international donors to do the same; also calls on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide full relief of the country's outstanding debt, including a USD 102 million emergency loan approved in January 2010; stresses that any emergency earthquake assistance must be provided in the form of grants, not debt-incurring loans; EN C 341 E/6 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "10. Reiterates the call by the UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for vehicles to transport fuel; calls on Member States to provide additional assistance to transport supplies to makeshift camps, distribution points and outlying towns and villages; 11. Underlines the importance of providing adequate security for aid distribution convoys in order to ensure that supplies are distributed in a fair and calm manner, particularly to the weak and those whose needs are greatest; 12. Welcomes the decision of the Council to send 350 military police to support the aid effort in Haiti under UN command, and the decision to set up a coordination cell (EUCO Haiti) in Brussels to facilitate a proactive European response in the military and security domain as well as coordination of contributions by EU Member States to the relief effort; 13. Calls on the UN to review MINUSTAH\u2019s mandate in conjunction with the Haitian authorities in order to respond to the country\u2019s post-disaster needs, with a particular focus on security issues; 14. Underlines the importance of providing local authorities with appropriate aid to enable them to stimulate the economy as hundreds of thousands of people leave Port-au-Prince to settle in the countryside; calls on the EU and other international donors wherever possible to purchase locally produced food for the relief effort; 15. Supports EU efforts to boost food production locally, rehabilitating damaged infrastructures and making the necessary material (seed, fertiliser and tools) available to agriculture smallholders \u2013 particularly for the spring planting season starting in March, which accounts for 60 % of national food production; 16. Asks the Commission to do all it can to support cash-for-work programmes, which are important for injecting cash into the community, and to assist with getting the banking system up and running; 17. Emphasises the need for long-term investment in the construction of earthquake-resistant buildings and in basic infrastructure, such as water supply, roads and electricity, which was non-existent or largely inadequate prior to the earthquake, thus greatly exacerbating the potential impact of natural disasters; 18. Calls for an international conference and a coordinated post-disaster needs assessment, involving the UN and the World Bank, in order to establish long-term reconstruction once the emergency operation is over; 19. Calls on the international community to ensure that the people of Haiti and their government are the main actors in the reconstruction process, to allow them to take ownership of their collective future; 20. Calls on the Commission to present to Parliament a comprehensive post-disaster needs assessment and a progress report on reconstruction; 21. Urges the EU to work with the Haitian authorities to establish disaster prevention and capacity management for the long term, emphasising that reconstruction efforts must be based on national priorities, while respecting aid-effectiveness principles and supporting Haiti's institutions in order to enable them to govern effectively; 22. Calls on the international community to keep Haiti high on the agenda, to use this as an opportunity to tackle the root causes of the underlying poverty in Haiti once and for all, and to assist Haiti in emerging from this disaster as a fully functioning democracy with an economy that can sustain its people; 23. Recognises the work done by individual Member States of the European Union through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and the effective coordination of this assistance by the MIC (Monitoring and Information Centre) and ECHO teams which were deployed only hours after the earthquake; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/7 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "24. Notes that, for the first time, the Commission successfully deployed two modules made available through a preparatory action on an EU Rapid Response Capability established with Parliament\u2019s support; 25. Calls on the Commission to bring proposals before it as soon as possible for establishing an EU Civil Protection Force based on the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and enabling the Union to bring together the resources necessary for providing initial emergency humanitarian aid within 24 hours of a disaster; 26. Emphasises that a European rapid response mechanism should: \u2014 be civilian and/or humanitarian \u2014 exist on a permanent basis \u2014 be capable of being mobilised at any time and as rapidly as possible \u2014 operate under the banner of the EU \u2014 observe international humanitarian law \u2014 be open to cooperation with other bodies involved in humanitarian action \u2014 be prepared to cooperate with the UN system \u2014 be open to contributions from third countries \u2014 respect the voluntary nature of the Member States\u2019 participation in the intended arrangements \u2014 endeavour on an ongoing basis to keep up the standard of the human and material resources available for mobilisation at any time \u2014 be based on the principle of burden sharing; 27. Calls on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response to play a leading role in coordinating the Union\u2019s crisis response, using the responsibilities created under the Lisbon Treaty to coordinate the Union\u2019s response to future crises more effectively, while building on what has already been achieved; 28. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the Commission, the President and Government of Haiti, the UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief and the governments of the Member States.

Notwithstanding Iran's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the rules of the non-proliferation regime, reiterates that the proliferation risks in connection with the Iranian nuclear programme remain a source of serious concern to the European Union and to the international community, as expressed very clearly in UNSC Resolutions 1737, 1747, 1803 and 1835; 15. Deplores the fact that no substantive progress has been made on key issues of serious concern, and repeats its calls to Iran to restore the transparency of its nuclear programme by providing full, clear and credible answers to the IAEA, to resolve all outstanding issues and concerns relating to this programme, including topics which could have a military dimension, to implement fully the provisions of the Compre\u00ad hensive Safeguards Agreement, including its subsidiary arrangements, and to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol; 16. Supports the European Council's twin-track approach and all efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the Iranian nuclear issue; insists that any further sanctions in the context of the nuclear threat should exclude measures that would have negative consequences for the Iranian people as a whole; 17. Deplores the fact that the Iranian Government has again rejected all attempts to achieve a compromise on the nuclear issue and that the Iranian regime is apparently seeking to use this issue both as a means of distracting attention from the crisis in the country and as a tactic to win time and avoid discussion in the UNSC of further sanctions, and regards the latest pronouncements by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as being part of these tactics; On EU-Iran relations 18.

Expresses its concern at the long-standing and growing presence of al-Qa'ida in Yemen and emphasises that a lack of concrete action could lead to a further erosion of central government authority and destabilisation of Yemen, and its neighbourhood, to the degree seen in Somalia, which will in turn provide opportunities for extremists directed or inspired by al-Qa'ida to regroup, organise, train, and launch terrorist operations inside or outside Yemeni territory; 8. Calls on the Yemeni authorities to implement the reforms needed in order to improve the human rights situation in the country, in particular by guaranteeing media freedom, the right to a fair trial and equal treatment for men and women; EN C 341 E/16 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",

Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "A. whereas trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery, a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights and reduces people to a state of dependency via threats, violence and humiliation, B. whereas trafficking in human beings is an extremely profitable business for organised crime, with high profit possibilities and limited risk-taking, C. whereas trafficking takes many forms, relating for example to sexual exploitation, forced labour, illegal trade in human organs, begging, illegal adoptions and domestic work, D. whereas Europol\u2019s assessment for 2009 is that trafficking of women for sexual exploitation has not decreased and trafficking for forced labour is increasing, E. whereas the UNODC, in its Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, records sexual exploitation as the most commonly identified form of human trafficking, followed by forced labour, and has also noted that 79 % of the identified victims of trafficking are women and girls, F. whereas mail-order brides can be trapped into an environment of slavery, becoming victims of sexual exploitation, forced labour, domestic work and other forms of trafficking in human beings, G. whereas children are particularly vulnerable and thus at greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings, H. whereas the financial and economic crisis may lead to increased trafficking in human beings, exploiting the need of potential victims to find a decent job and escape poverty, I. whereas the extent and severity of this problem are alarming: \u2014 Europol\u2019s 2009 report on trafficking in human beings in the European Union shows that this is a business worth many millions of euros/dollars a year; \u2014 based on the available figures, it is reasonable to estimate that several hundred thousand people are trafficked into or within the EU every year; \u2014 in 2008 Eurojust opened 83 cases of trafficking in human beings, representing an increase of more then 10 % in comparison with 2007 (71 cases), J. whereas the EU legal framework on trafficking in human beings is currently based mainly on: \u2014 Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings, which aims to ensure a minimum degree of harmonisation of national legislation; \u2014 Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities, K. whereas experience shows that this legal framework is neither sufficiently effective nor implemented adequately, and that the EU must consequently take stronger action, EN C 341 E/20 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "L. whereas in March 2009 the Commission presented a proposal for a framework decision on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting victims, repealing Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA COM(2009)0136 final, with the aim of strengthening the current framework decision through tougher sanctions, better protection of victims and active preventive measures, M. whereas, despite the efforts of the Swedish Presidency, the text was not adopted, and whereas a proposal for a new legal instrument under the Treaty of Lisbon legal framework is likely to be tabled in the near future, N. whereas the Treaty of Lisbon will strengthen EU action in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, including in combating trafficking in human beings, and Parliament, as co-legislator, will have a full role to play here, O. whereas action against trafficking in human beings cannot be limited to legislative instruments but also needs to include non-legislative efforts, in particular evaluation of the implementation of adopted measures, information gathering and sharing, cooperation and partnership-building and the sharing of best practices, P. whereas it is crucial to involve civil society organisations active in the field from the outset and at every stage: from identification through to the provision of assistance to victims, including in the legislative process, Q. whereas currently there is no precise data on this phenomenon and the available figures appear to underestimate its real scope, as it is a form of crime that takes place underground and is often undetected or wrongly identified; whereas more research must be done on how trafficking takes place, who commits it, how demand drives the supply of services from victims and who falls victim to it and why, and on ways to discourage demand; whereas cooperation and exchanges of information between the Member States and third countries need to be stepped up, R. whereas future action must start with an integrated approach, bringing together prevention and repression as well as protection, support and assistance for victims, and including enhanced cooperation among all stakeholders, S. whereas if the demand from potential buyers of the services and products supplied by victims of trafficking is reduced, thereby also reducing profits from trafficking in human beings, the supply of such services and goods by victims will in turn decrease, T. whereas the social integration of potential victims has an indirect preventive effect, helping to stop them being re-victimised or even becoming potential traffickers, U. whereas cooperation and partnership between the EU, the Council of Europe, the UN and third countries \u2013 and in particular with countries of origin of trafficked persons and with the United States, as a commonly recognised country of destination \u2013 is crucial in order to protect fundamental rights and to combat trafficking effectively, V. whereas, in the establishment and subsequent implementation of policies and measures relating to trafficking in human beings, attention must be paid to securing such an outcome without discrimination on any ground such as nationality, race, colour, sex, religion, political or other views, social background or other status, General 1. Calls on the Council and the Commission: \u2014 to develop action against trafficking in human beings on the basis of a holistic approach centred on human rights and focusing on combating trafficking, prevention, and protection of victims; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/21 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "\u2014 to adopt a victim-focused approach, meaning that all potential categories of victim must be identified, targeted and protected, with special attention being given to children and other at-risk groups; \u2014 to establish, under the supervision of the Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, an EU anti-trafficking coordinator to coordinate EU action and policies in this field \u2013 including the activities of the network of national rapporteurs \u2013 and reporting to both the EP and the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI); \u2014 to ensure that the fight against trafficking in human beings stays high on their agenda during times of economic and financial crisis, for instance when preparing recovery plans; \u2014 to ensure that policies on trafficking in human beings cover aspects linked to social affairs and social inclusion, and to insist on appropriate programmes and effective methods of ensuring social rehabili\u00ad tation of victims, including measures relating to the labour market and the social security system; \u2014 to give due attention to the external relations dimension of trafficking in human beings and the dimensions of immigration, asylum and reintegration policies; \u2014 to run information and awareness campaigns through the education and school system in the countries of origin, transit and destination for trafficking; \u2014 to make the best interests of children a primary consideration in all action against trafficking, in accordance with the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; \u2014 to approach all policies, strategies and measures against trafficking from a gender perspective; \u2014 to strengthen coordination and cooperation with the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Union Institute for Gender Equality; \u2014 to establish and step up ongoing cooperation with NGOs working in this field; \u2014 to establish a permanent platform at EU level, grouping the efforts of EU institutions, agencies and institutes, of police, customs services, procurement offices and law enforcement bodies at regional and national level in the Member States, and of international organisations and NGOs; 2. Calls on those Member States that have not yet done so to ratify and implement the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; Information gathering 3. Calls on the Council and the Commission, in order to obtain as much information as possible, to take action with a view to: \u2014 the annual publication of a joint report by Eurojust, Europol and Frontex, to be presented to the EP and the national parliaments as well as the Commission and the Council. This joint report, the presentation of which should be followed by a public hearing with NGOs and civil society so that they can add their expertise, should promote work towards a better understanding of: \u2014 root causes; \u2014 factors in countries of origin and destination that facilitate trafficking in human beings; EN C 341 E/22 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",

Calls on the Member States to develop targeted awareness-raising education programmes designed to draw children\u2019s attention to traps that can easily lead to trafficking; Prosecution 8. Calls for an exhaustive and comprehensive legal framework, including policies to counter cybercrime connected to trafficking, to be adopted as soon as possible; 9. Calls for the Commission and the Member States to take into account the following elements in drafting any future proposal for a legislative instrument in this field: a. the level of penalties and sanctions for those \u2013 including legal persons \u2013 who profit from trafficking in human beings should reflect the seriousness of the crime and have a dissuasive effect, and trafficking in children should be particularly severely punished; b. further action should focus on victims\u2019 protection \u2013 with due consideration for the situation of children and women \u2013 by, inter alia, ensuring that assistance to victims is unconditional, that a victim\u2019s consent to exploitation is always irrelevant and that victims are entitled to assistance irrespective of their willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/23 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "c. further prevention and action could also focus on the users of services supplied by trafficked people; d. due attention should be paid to the need for extraterritorial jurisdiction for trafficking-related offences, with regard to both EU nationals and residents; e. any provision on jurisdiction should be coordinated with the draft framework decision on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings; 10. Calls on the Member States and the national parliaments \u2013 given that legislation has no effect if it is not correctly implemented \u2013 to implement in full the EU policies on trafficking in human beings at national level and to ratify and implement other legal instruments in this field as soon as possible; 11.

Underlines the importance of providing assistance and support for victims of trafficking, and, furthermore, calls on Frontex and national border-control agencies, in the course of their activities, to define common practices in order to raise their staff\u2019s awareness of the issue of trafficking and to identify victims of trafficking and ensure their protection; 14. Calls, given that repression cannot be limited to the confines of the EU, for comprehensive agreements \u2013 including provisions on respect for fundamental rights \u2013 to be concluded with third countries and for the establishment of cooperation, subject to strict rules, with those countries; Protection, support and assistance for victims 15. Calls for protection and support for victims to be a priority in EU actions in this field, and for victims to receive all possible help from the moment they are identified as such, including: \u2014 access to at least a temporary residence permit, irrespective of their willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings, and simplified access to the labour market, including the provision of training and other forms of upskilling, as a minimum on the basis of Directive 2004/81/EC; \u2014 access to appropriate secure accommodation and specialist support services, including the provision of a food/subsistence allowance, access to emergency medical treatment, access to counselling services, trans\u00ad lation and interpretation where appropriate, help contacting family and friends, and access to education for children; \u2014 a simplified family reunification policy for victims, particularly where this is required for their protection; 16. Draws attention to particularly vulnerable victims, such as children and women, and calls for specific assistance and protection programmes for them; 17.

Outcome of the Copenhagen summit on climate change P7_TA(2010)0019 European Parliament resolution of 10 February 2010 on the outcome of the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change (COP 15) (2010/C 341 E/06) The European Parliament , \u2014 having regard to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, \u2014 having regard to the Bali Action Plan (Decision 1/COP 13), \u2014 having regard to the fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the UNFCCC and the fifth Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 5) held in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 7 to 18 December 2009, and to the Copenhagen Accord, \u2014 having regard to the EU Climate Change Package adopted on 17 December 2008, \u2014 having regard to its previous resolutions relating to climate change, and in particular that of 25 November 2009 on the EU strategy for the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change (COP 15), \u2014 having regard to the next conference, COP 16, to be held in Mexico, \u2014 having regard to Rule 110(4) of its Rules of Procedure, A. whereas negotiations on a comprehensive international post-2012 agreement on climate change, which were due to be concluded in Copenhagen in December 2009, ended with a disappointing Accord, of which note was merely taken by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, B. whereas the Accord is not legally binding and does not include any emission reduction targets or indeed any specific commitment to conclude a legally binging agreement in 2010, C. whereas the Accord recognises the need to limit global temperatures rise to no more than 2 \u00b0C and includes a reference to exploring pathways to remaining below a 1,5 \u00b0C global temperature increase, D. whereas the EU failed to play a leading role in the fight against climate change and was not even involved in the final negotiations with the USA, China, India, Brazil and South Africa on the final draft of the Accord, EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/25 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "E. whereas the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, together with an ever-mounting body of scientific evidence, recognises that deep cuts in global emissions are required to keep the world temperature below a 2 \u00b0C increase, F. whereas several developed and developing countries failed to support the formulation and implemen\u00ad tation of a new international climate protection framework, G. whereas the EU should not allow its own commitment to climate change action to falter, even if some of our main negotiating partners continue to appear unwilling or unable to curb their emissions trajectories, H. Notes that only 28 states outside the EU have communicated greenhouse gas emission targets from 2020 to the UN by the deadline of 31 January 2010 and that some only communicated efficiency targets that will not lead to reductions at all, 1. Regrets the weakness of the Accord achieved at the COP 15 as it brings us no closer to a global comprehensive post-2012 agreement, does not set global mid- or long-term reduction targets, and does not state when global emissions would need to peak; takes note, furthermore, of the disappointment in the public mind as regards the failure to reach a meaningful agreement in Copenhagen; 2. Considers that delay in finding international agreement is not a justification for postponing further EU policies to achieve the already legally binding commitment to reduce our emissions by 20 % by 2020; reiterates our desire to move to a 30 % reduction; notes also that the initiatives taken within the EU to promote and encourage the green economy, energy security and reduced energy dependency will make it increasingly easy to fulfil a 30 % reduction commitment; 3. Recognises that the estimated cost of the EU achieving a 30 % cut in 1990 emissions by 2020 is now less than the estimated cost of achieving a 20 % cut when that was agreed, and calls on the Commission, therefore, to bring forward a proposal for the EU to raise its ambition and unilaterally to set a 2020 reduction target greater than 20 %; 4. Calls on the EU to achieve domestic targets through energy savings and renewable energy sources, and for an ambitious and binding energy savings target to be agreed as soon as possible; 5. Expresses its disappointment at the Member States\u2019 lack of unity; urges the EU, therefore, to speak with one voice in international climate negotiations in order to keep its leading role in negotiations towards a binding, comprehensive post-2012 agreement, in line with the latest developments in science and consistent with the 2 \u00b0C objective at COP 16; 6. Regrets, furthermore, that the EU was not able, through earlier specific commitments to international public finance for climate efforts in developing countries, to build confidence in the negotiations in order to make further progress in the Ad Hoc Working Groups; calls on the EU, furthermore, to clarify its position regarding a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol being conditional on similar commitments being made by the US under another legal instrument and to ensure that surplus AAUs and LULUCF rules do not undermine its environmental integrity; 7. Underlines that there is a need to create a new \u2018climate diplomacy\u2019; calls, therefore, on the EU's High Representative and the Commissioner responsible for climate action to lead this strategy, especially with the more progressive developing and emerging countries; urges the EU to agree on a \u2018Roadmap for Mexico\u2019 which will include the discussion of climate policies in every strategic partnership and bilateral and multi\u00ad lateral cooperation agreement in order to create a more coherent external climate protection strategy; calls on the EU and its Member States to build an \u2018Alliance of Responsibility\u2019, open to all countries that consider climate change as a major threat to humanity and are prepared to act in order to stop global warming; 8. Calls on the EU and its Member States to enforce the principle of \u2018climate justice\u2019 in the long-term perspective 2050 and beyond; advocates, therefore, an equity clause in future international climate negotiations; EN C 341 E/26 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "9. Calls on forums such as G20 or the Major Economies Forum, representing the major carbon producers, to take greater responsibility in helping to forge consensus in the formal negotiations; 10. Notes the commitment to a USD 100 billion annual fund from developed countries by 2020 and the sum of USD 30 bn for developing countries over the next three years (2010-2012), to help fight climate change and the establishing of a green climate fund to support projects in developing countries related to deforestation and forest degradation; regrets, however, that the commitment falls short of the Commission's estimation that EUR 100 billion would be raised by 2020; 11. Stresses the historical responsibility of developed countries for irreversible climate change and their responsibility to provide sufficient, sustainable and predictable financial and technical support to the developing countries to allow them to commit themselves to the reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the consequences of climate change and to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as to enhance capacity building, in order to comply with obligations under the future international agreement on climate change; 12. Insists that such commitments to provide for the required predictable financial support for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the context of the UNFCCC must be new and additional to ODA and independent of annual budgetary procedures in the Member States; recalls the already-existing commitments aimed at achieving ODA levels of 0.7 % of GDP by 2015; 13. Believes that the EU should immediately enter into negotiations with our US counterparts so that the emerging carbon market in the US is compatible with our own, thereby creating a transatlantic carbon market as a precursor for a global one; 14. Stresses the need for the EUR 7.2 billion \u2018fast-start\u2019 financial support for developing countries, as pledged by the EU Member States, to be, new and additional to ODA budgets, coordinated at EU level and made operational as soon as possible and in any case before the June 2010 meeting in Bonn; considers this to be a key factor in building confidence for a successful meeting in Mexico; calls also on the Commission to report on the use of the pledged fast-start funding and its additionality to existing ODA before the aforementioned Bonn meeting; 15. Recalls that the collective contribution by the EU towards developing countries\u2019 mitigation efforts and adaptation needs should not be less than EUR 30 000 million per annum by 2020, a figure that may increase as new knowledge is acquired concerning the severity of climate change and the scale of its costs; 16. Emphasises that the upcoming EU budget review needs to focus on providing sufficient resources for measures to protect against, and adapt to, climate change, both within EU and in developing countries; notes also that the review should consider the introduction of new and innovative financial mechanisms to support international climate action; 17. Welcomes the ambitious commitment that some developing countries made before, during and after the Copenhagen negotiations; notes that the Accord found an agreement regarding the measuring, reporting and verification of developing country mitigation actions through national communications, which will be subject to international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines, still to be defined, that will need to ensure that sovereignty and a proper use of funds are respected; 18. Agrees with the setting up a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing removals of greenhouse gas emissions by forests and for the establishment of a Technology Mechanism to accelerate technology development and transfer, and welcomes the reference to the role of markets in enhancing the cost-effectiveness of mitigation actions; notes also that effective implementation of such mechanisms requires agreement in the UNFCCC framework; 19. Emphasises that any future REDD scheme must respect the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, including their right to collective property and to autonomous indigenous territories, and provide for their full and effective participation, including in the development and implementation of national REDD plans, and allocation or distribution of financing; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/27 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "20. Calls for the environmental effectiveness of Annex I emissions reduction targets to be the guiding principle as regards the EU approach to international accounting rules for forest management and LULUCF, to flexible mechanisms and to the banking of any overachievement during first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol towards post-2012 targets; 21. Regrets the lack of progress in tackling global aviation and maritime emissions; calls on the EU to ensure that the full climate impact of aviation is taken into account and that the reduction targets for the aviation and maritime sectors are the same as other industry sectors in the future agreement; 22. Regrets that the USA and China were not prepared to accept a more ambitious agreement for internal policy reasons; believes that the European Union, the USA and China are key to ensuring a binding international agreement; urges the United States and China, as well as other international partners, therefore, to come up with further commitments to an international system of climate protection, in order to resume discussions and achieve an ambitious and legally binding international agreement in line with the latest developments in science and consistent with the 2 \u00b0C objective; 23. Regrets that some countries, namely Sudan and the ALBA-Countries, adopted a blocking attitude in the international negotiations in order to avoid strict and binding commitments, in spite of the high level of political momentum in Copenhagen; 24. Points to the growing public awareness of the impact of climate change in the developing world, but also within rapidly emerging economies; calls for enhanced dialogue, in particular with the least developed countries, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Africa, on the way to a binding international agreement on climate change in order to reduce the impact and foreseeable consequences of climate change on demographics, public health, migration and the economy in those regions; 25. Stresses the urgent need for the IPCC to review all its conclusions in order to confirm that they have been peer-reviewed in accordance with the best principles of science, suggests that the preparation of an interim report bringing the conclusions up to date should be brought forward, and believes that future reports should make specific reference to the claims of those who challenge the majority view and that these too should be subjected to peer review; 26. Finds it essential, for the competitiveness of EU industry, that comparable efforts be accepted by other industrialised nations outside the EU, as well as reasonable reduction commitments by developing and emerging economies; recalls that reduction targets must be measurable, reportable and verifiable, and welcomes in this respect the commitments by some developing countries to submit national reports on their emissions reductions efforts; 27. Considers that the bilateral meetings between the European Parliament and the national parliaments can substantially contribute to the debate and facilitate understanding among the parties; envisages, therefore, holding these meetings before the beginning of the official negotiations in order to contribute in a more meaningful way to the best possible outcome of the negotiations; 28. Emphasises that the challenges of the climate policy in the future lie not only with CO 2 reduction but also a more efficient and sustainable use of natural resources; 29. Reaffirms its support for the reform process in the UN, and notes that the outcome of the Copenhagen Climate Conference is another example confirming the urgent need to reconsider working methods within the UN; remains committed, moreover, to the climate negotiations under the UN framework, as the only legitimate body to address an issue of such fundamental importance to the entire global community; considers, however, that serious reflection on how to make the process more efficient is urgently needed; 30. Calls for greater transparency to allow for a better involvement of civil society and stakeholders at COP 16 in Mexico; 31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with the request that it be circulated to all non-EU contracting parties.

        "C. whereas globalisation has made it increasingly difficult to combat fiscal fraud at international level, and the 27 EU Member States with their major differences are particularly affected; whereas these factors militate strongly in favour of improving international cooperation within the EU and at international level in order to ensure that it is effective, D. whereas tax avoidance and tax evasion at international level constitute a serious obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, E. whereas a significant number of multinational companies have been structured so as to take advantage of tax avoidance in the different jurisdictions in which they operate; whereas differential tax treatment in different jurisdictions favours undertakings that are large, international or well-established over those that are small, domestic or new (start-ups), F. whereas multinational companies\u2019 ability to make extensive use of tax havens and offshore centres as part of their tax avoidance strategies conflicts with the principle of fair competition and corporate responsibility, G. whereas tax havens conflict with the principles of solidarity, justice and redistribution; whereas, in a globalised economy, a significant number of multinational companies use their power to put pressure on governments, particularly those of developing countries, to lower tax rates and provide tax incentives to attract investment; whereas in practice this has shifted the tax burden onto workers and low-income households and forced damaging cutbacks in public services, H. whereas the Council is currently dealing with a number of important legislative proposals on the taxation of savings, administrative cooperation and mutual assistance for the recovery of taxes; whereas strengthening good tax governance within the EU will provide a political and moral basis from which to demand good tax governance of third countries, I. whereas the adoption of the General Anti-Avoidance Principles (GAAP) gives tax authorities the power to consider whether the main purpose of a particular transaction is the avoidance or reduction of tax liability and, if so, to levy additional tax in order to counteract such avoidance or reduction, J. whereas developing countries frequently do not have the legitimacy or authority to tax their own citizens, precisely because of poor tax governance; whereas in formulating its tax governance policy, the EU must take into account the specific problems faced by developing countries and provide support to overcome them, K. whereas the combined efforts of the G-20 and the UN, together with the efforts made as part of OECD- led initiatives, have produced some promising results in the area of tax governance; whereas those results remain insufficient to cope with the challenges presented by tax havens and offshore centres and must be followed by decisive, effective and consistent action, L. whereas the OECD currently values private capital accumulated in tax havens at almost USD 1 000 000 000 000 (one billion), a figure five times higher than two decades ago; whereas more than one million companies, particularly in the United States and the EU Member States, have their registered offices in countries in which such tax havens are located, M. whereas there is evidence that the financial crisis was driven partly by new types of complex financial instrument and derivative placed, to a large extent, in funds domiciled in secrecy jurisdictions; whereas tax havens host, for example, complex financial products that cause financial instability, and many financial institutions had off-balance-sheet liabilities located in tax havens; whereas overall the financial crisis has shed new light on the consequences of a lack of good governance, highlighting the risks associated with opaque jurisdictions, EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/31 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "N. whereas only 5 % of cross-border tax claims are recovered in the European Union, An opportunity that must be seized 1. Strongly condemns the role played by tax havens in encouraging and profiteering from tax avoidance, tax evasion and capital flight; urges the Member States, therefore, to make the fight against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight a priority; calls on the EU to step up its action and to take immediate concrete measures \u2013 such as sanctions \u2013 against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight; 2. Considers good tax governance \u2013 understood to mean transparency, exchange of information at all levels, effective cross-border cooperation and fair tax competition \u2013 to be a key element in rebuilding the global economy after the 2008 financial collapse; 3. Recalls in this context that it is of primary importance to put an end to the use of artificial legal persons as a way to avoid taxation; stresses also that instead of bank secrecy, automatic information exchange should take place in all circumstances, including in all the Member States and dependent terri\u00ad tories; welcomes in this respect the Commission\u2019s proposal on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation because, inter alia, it extends cooperation between the Member States to cover taxes of any kind, abolishes bank secrecy and establishes the automatic exchange of information as a general rule; At EU level 4. Recalls that Parliament has delivered its position to the Council on amendments to Directive 2003/48/EC, asking, inter alia, that it end the temporary derogation that allows Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg to avoid exchanging information by applying a withholding tax; urges the Council to adopt the directive amending Directive 2003/48/EC in accordance with Parliament\u2019s position; 5. Welcomes as a first step, in relation to EU savings taxation, the withdrawal by Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland of their reservations to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, and the endorsement of the OECD standards by Andorra, Monaco, Liechtenstein and San Marino; welcomes Belgium\u2019s decision to switch from a system of withholding tax to one of automatic exchange of information from 1 January 2010; 6. Stresses Parliament\u2019s request, in its position of 24 April 2009, to extend substantially the scope of Directive 2003/48/EC, in particular to cover legal entities (especially private companies and trusts) and various forms of investment income; recalls that the provisions of Directive 2003/48/EC should be extended to Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and other jurisdictions such as Dubai, New Zealand, Ghana and certain states of the United States, which are not bound by the Directive 2003/48/EC and are therefore a favoured location for tax evaders; 7. Considers that the marketing in the EU of alternative funds domiciled in a third country must be conditional on that third country complying with good tax governance standards, including the effective implementation, on the basis of legally binding rules, of the principle of automatic exchange of information; stresses in particular that progress made on tax governance standards within international forums such as the OECD and the G-20 should not prevent the European Union from applying higher standards; 8. Emphasises that more efficient implementation of existing EU and national tax legislation would facilitate better recovery of taxes; also highlights, however, the urgent need for further efforts and measures aimed at improving good governance in tax matters; 9. Recalls that VAT-related tax fraud is a matter of particular concern for the functioning of the internal market insofar as it has a direct cross-border impact, involves substantial amounts of lost revenue and directly affects the EU budget; urges the Council to adopt the new directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and to fight fraud in the area of VAT, taking due account of Parliament\u2019s position; EN C 341 E/32 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "At international level 10. Urges all parties concerned to accelerate the conclusion of the anti-fraud agreement with Liech\u00ad tenstein; urges the Council to agree on a mandate for the Commission to negotiate similar agreements with Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland; calls, in this respect, on the Member States to review their bilateral tax agreements with third countries; 11. Calls for increased cooperation, such as the automatic exchange of information between countries, with a view to facilitating the recovery of capital moved abroad via illegal activity to the detriment of the internal market; 12. Asks the Commission to report quickly on the Council\u2019s recommendation of 14 May 2008 that a good tax governance clause be included in relevant agreements to be concluded with third countries by the European Union and its Member States; in particular, stresses the need for provisions on good governance to be negotiated in the context of general or specific agreements with third countries and the need to ensure an effective process for monitoring their implementation; 13. Recalls, as regards the work on harmful tax competition under the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation, the need to ensure that the Member States implement the Code in their relations with third countries in a manner consistent with their efforts to promote transparency and exchange of information in tax matters; 14. Welcomes, as a first step, the advances made in the area of good tax governance as a result of the initiatives in other international fora such as the G-20, the G-8, the UN and, notably, the OECD; considers, nevertheless, that the commitments made by the G-20 to date are not sufficient to address the challenges posed by tax evasion, tax havens and off-shore centres; 15. Recalls that efforts to combat tax havens and tax evasion will be successful only if the same rules apply to all, so as to avoid the creation of further legal loopholes open to abuse; in this context, takes the view that Directive 2003/48/EC, which established the principle of automatic multilateral information exchange between countries, is a welcome step towards the establishment of a global framework for automatic information exchange; welcomes, accordingly, the Commission\u2019s proposal to promote coop\u00ad eration with third countries in the framework of Directive 2003/48/EC; 16. Calls on the OECD and its Member States to involve the Commission fully in the Global Forum peer review exercise, in particular as regards the identification of non-cooperative jurisdictions, the development of a process for evaluating compliance and the implementation of dissuasive counter-measures to promote adherence to the standards in question; considers, furthermore, that the OECD framework for combating tax havens is unsatisfactory; highlights the need to improve the indicator for achieving the status of a coop\u00ad erating jurisdiction by, for example, giving it a qualitative value; is critical of the fact that this indicator requires the conclusion of a mere 12 tax information exchange agreements; regrets, in this context, that the exchange of information takes place only on request rather than being a compulsory and binding requirement, and, furthermore, that the OECD allows governments to escape its blacklist merely by promising to comply with the information exchange principles, without ensuring that those principles are actually put into practice; Towards a genuine EU policy of good tax governance 17. Considers that there is a need for consistency and for a genuine EU policy of good tax governance; believes that the European Union\u2019s credibility depends, inter alia, on its willingness to clamp down on tax havens on its own territory first as an example of good governance; asks the Commission to monitor closely, in this context, the swift and thorough implementation of the actions set out in its communication on promoting good governance in tax matters; 18. Considers, without prejudice to the competence of the Member States, that the Commission should be asked to design and formulate such an EU approach and be given the necessary resources; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/33 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "19. Recommends setting up an appropriate incentive system for the recovery of cross-border tax claims in order to increase the current low recovery rate of 5 % by distributing a fair proportion of the unpaid tax income collected to both the administration recovering the tax claims on behalf of the requesting Member State, on the one hand, and the administration of the requesting Member State, on the other; 20. In regard to mutual assistance for the recovery of tax claims, duties and other measures, invites the Commission to estimate the number of cross-border tax claims by the Member States to be recovered within the territory of the European Union and to introduce quantifiable indicators for measuring progress in cross-border recovery over time; 21. Considers that the EU should actively promote the improvement of the OECD standards, with the aim of making the automatic, multilateral exchange of information the global standard; urges the EU, furthermore, to adopt measures that prevent abuse of the \u2018residence principle\u2019 through artificial domicile and ownership schemes allowing holding companies with no activity or shell companies to shield beneficial owners from paying taxes in their country of domicile; urges the EU also to adopt a common approach to the application of anti-abuse measures, which should be effective, fair and aligned with the concept of wholly artificial arrangements as established by the Court of Justice; 22. Urges the EU to implement a consistent approach to good tax governance in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the enlargement policy and the development cooperation policy; stresses that the tax governance policy should actively contribute to building sustainable and transparent tax systems in developing countries, in particular with a view to eradicating tax fraud, which leads to an annual loss of tax revenue corresponding to 10 times the amount of development aid injected by developed countries; considers that an appropriate level of resources must be allocated to achieving that objective; recalls that tax governance will ultimately attract investment insofar as it contributes to legal tax certainty, transparency and stability; 23. Stresses the need to revise current international accounting standards with the aim of increasing transparency; calls in this regard for a requirement for the disclosure in companies\u2019 annual accounts, on a country-by-country basis, of accounting information relating to tax havens, and suggests an EU public register listing the names of individuals and undertakings having set up companies and accounts in tax havens, with a view to unveiling the true beneficiaries shielded by offshore companies; 24. Emphasises the need for the Member States to coordinate their policies in order to enhance the implementation of anti-avoidance rules; 25. Recalls that the introduction of a common corporate consolidated tax base would help to tackle \u2013 within the EU \u2013 double taxation and transfer price issues within consolidated groups; looks forward in this regard to receiving the Commission\u2019s impact assessment by the end of this year at the latest; 26. Suggests that, in order better to identify inaccurate transaction pricing and the most frequently applied tax evasion techniques, the Commission prioritise the wider application of the comparable profits method, thus shifting the scope of the transfer-pricing inspection from transaction to company level; points out that the comparable profits method focuses on comparing earnings between companies in each industrial sector and that a fall in the profits of a multinational company\u2019s subsidiary which is significantly lower than the sector-wide average over time may be evidence of massive transfer pricing; 27. Urges the EU to examine a range of options for sanctions and incentives to promote good tax governance, such as a special levy on movements to or from non-cooperative jurisdictions, non-recognition within the EU of the legal status of companies set up in non-cooperative jurisdictions and a prohibition on EU financial institutions establishing or maintaining subsidiaries and branches in non-cooperative juris\u00ad dictions; 28. Considers that the EU should also ensure consistency in the implementation at EU and international level of standards in the areas of prudential supervision, taxation and money laundering and counter\u00ad terrorism; EN C 341 E/34 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",

        "\u2014 having regard to Rule 48 and Rule 119(2) of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality (A7-0004/2010), A. whereas equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the EU, recognised by the Treaty on European Union and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; whereas in spite of the significant progress made in this field, many inequalities between women and men remain, B. whereas the European Union is currently experiencing a major economic, financial and social crisis that has specific consequences for women in the labour market, C. whereas motherhood and fatherhood must be viewed as fundamental rights central to social stability; whereas the EU has a directive on maternity leave ( 1 ) and a directive on parental leave ( 2 ), but no legislation of any kind has been produced to date on paternity leave, D. whereas, because of gender segregation by occupation and sector, and according to the data available, in general the crisis initially hit men harder than women, but the situation is different in some countries and in some sectors, especially in traditional industries employing large numbers of women, in which, in many cases, firms are shutting down and multinationals are relocating; whereas the proportion of the female workforce in part-time employment is 31,1 % as against a corresponding figure of 7,9 % in the male workforce; whereas women occupy the majority of jobs in some sectors of the public service and, according to the Member States, account for up to two-thirds of the workforce in the education, health and social welfare sectors; whereas, therefore, they are particularly likely to lose out in the event of budget cuts in these sectors, E. whereas women are traditionally at greater risk of poverty \u2013 especially single mothers and women aged over 65, who are often in receipt of pensions barely above the minimum subsistence level for various reasons such as having taken a break from or stopped work to take on family responsibilities, or having worked in their husband\u2019s undertaking, particularly in the business and agriculture sectors, without remuneration and without social security affiliation, and whereas most policies aim to support families with children, despite the fact that up to 35 % of households consist of a single person, which in the majority of cases is a woman, F. whereas the female employment rate is 59,1 % on average, with considerable variation (ranging from 37,4 % to 74,3 %), the steady increase in that rate since 2000 has not improved women\u2019s conditions of employment, and women still suffer the effects of gender segregation by occupation and sector, G. whereas social economy enterprises are a success story where female employability is concerned, to the extent that they enhance women\u2019s social status, promote their financial independence, and help them to achieve work-life balance, not least by offering them care services for children, older people, and people with disabilities, H. whereas, since 2000, the average gender pay gap has remained stubbornly wide (between 14 % and 17,4 %) despite numerous measures taken by the Commission and commitments entered into by the Member States, I. whereas Article 157 of the TFEU provides that \u2018Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied\u2019 and that principle has been consistently reaffirmed in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/37 ( 1 ) Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (OJ L 348, 28.11.1992, p. 1). ( 2 ) Council Directive 96/34/EC of 3 June 1996 on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (OJ L 145, 19.6.1996, p. 4). Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "J. whereas, in the above-mentioned resolution of 18 November 2008, it asked the Commission to submit to it, by 31 December 2009, a legislative proposal for revision of the existing legislation relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women, K. whereas men, too, are losing out, though not as significantly, as a result of gender segregation by occupation and sector and sexist stereotyping, L. whereas the sharing between women and men of domestic and family responsibilities, notably through greater recourse to parental and paternity leave, is a sine qua non for the advancement and achievement of equality between women and men, regrets however, that the Social Partners\u2019 Framework Agreement on Parental Leave (July 2009) fails to address the issue of paid leave which would have a decisive impact on the take-up rate of men and the equal sharing of professional and family responsibilities between women and men, M. whereas access to services for the care of children, the elderly and other dependants is essential for equal participation of women and men in the labour market, education and training, N. whereas, at the Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002, the Member States were asked to provide childcare by 2010 for at least 90 % of children between three years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33 % of children under three years old, but more than half of them are still a long way from meeting those targets, O. whereas 58,9 % of the university qualifications awarded in the Union in 2008 went to women and women outnumber men in business, management and law faculties, yet they are in the minority in corporate and political positions of responsibility; whereas few women have IT, engineering or physics degrees and women are consequently under-represented in the private sector, with its crucial role in economic recovery; whereas the gender gap between women and men\u2019s employment in the IT sector has tended to widen rather than narrow over time, P. whereas the proportion of female MEPs rose from 32,1 % in the 2004-2009 parliamentary term to 35 % after the elections of 7 June 2009 and there were increases, too, in the proportion of female chairs of parliamentary committees, up from 25 % to 41 %, and the proportion of female EP vice-presidents, up from 28,5 % to 42,8 %, but the number of female quaestors fell from 3 to 2, Q. whereas the conditions of some groups of women who often face several combined difficulties and risks as well as double discrimination \u2014 in particular disabled women, women with dependants, elderly women and minority and immigrant women \u2014 show signs of deterioration, R. whereas migrant women are doubly discriminated against in the labour market \u2013 on account of both their gender and their migrant status; whereas one in five highly qualified migrants is in a low-level job and migrant women employed in the domestic, CHR/Horeca and agricultural sectors are particularly vulnerable, S. whereas, for both men and women, employment rates are lower in rural areas, and, in addition, a lot of women are never active in the official labour market and, therefore, are neither registered as unem\u00ad ployed nor included in unemployment statistics, which leads to particular financial and legal problems in relation to the right to maternity and sick leave, the acquisition of pension rights and access to social security, as well as problems in the event of divorce; whereas rural areas are badly affected by the lack of high-quality employment opportunities, T. whereas minority women, especially Romani women, regularly experience multiple forms of discrimi\u00ad nation on the basis of race and gender; whereas National Equality Bodies should properly address the phenomena of multiple or compound discrimination, EN C 341 E/38 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "U. whereas trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery, and most victims of trafficking are still women and girls, V. whereas the above-mentioned resolution of 3 September 2008 called on the Member States to ratify without delay the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which is the strongest European legal instrument in the fight against that trafficking, which constitutes a crime and a violation of human rights and impugns the dignity and integrity of the human being; whereas only 16 EU Member States have so far ratified that Convention, W. whereas violence against women, in all its forms, is a major hindrance to equality between women and men and is one of the most widespread human rights violations, knowing no geographical, economic, or social limits; whereas it is a severe problem in the Union, where some 20-25 % of women suffer physical violence, and more than 10 % sexual violence, in the course of their adult lives; whereas the Spanish Presidency of the Council has made it a priority to combat such violence, X. whereas sexual and reproductive health implies a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes, whereas recognition of the full physical and sexual autonomy of women is a precondition for any successful sexual and reproductive health rights policy, as well as for policies combating violence against women, Y. whereas the European Institute for Gender Equality was officially established in 2006 and was supposed to have begun functioning by 19 January 2008 at the latest but is still not fully functioning, Z. whereas the Lisbon Strategy has aimed to ensure that 60 % of women able to work are in employment and efforts relating to the demographic challenge seek to promote higher birth rates to meet future requirements; whereas equal opportunities between men and women and the work-life balance remain central to the debate on demographic change, 1. Congratulates the Commission for emphasising, in its 2009 report on equality between women and men, the importance of strengthening gender equality policies at a time of economic upheaval, but points to the need for further practical action and new policies; 2. Is critical of the fact that economic recovery projects mainly focus on male dominated employment; underlines that support for the future of men\u2019s rather than women\u2019s employment increases rather than decreases gender inequality, insists that gender equality must be mainstreamed in European, national and international plans for economic recovery; 3. Urges the Council, Commission and Member States to defend social rights and to guarantee that the economic and financial crisis will not lead to cuts in social benefits and social services, in particular child care and care for the elderly; points out that care policies and the provision of care services are intrinsically related to the achievement of equality between women and men; 4. Points out that the economic, social and financial crisis might offer an opportunity to make the Union, as an economy, more productive and innovative and, as a society, more mindful of gender equality, if the right policies and measures were to be put into effect; 5. Calls on the Commission to supply detailed statistics on how the crisis is affecting women and men, taking account of unemployment rates and trends in part-time working and in temporary and open-ended contracts, and on how policies to tackle the crisis are affecting public services; 6. Maintains that the Commission and the Member States must develop, support, and strengthen the role of women in the social economy, bearing in mind the high female employment rate in that sector and the importance of the services which it offers to promote work-life balance; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/39 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "7. Calls on those Member States having to implement fiscal consolidation policies to ensure that women are not disproportionately affected, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to prepare recovery policies that reflect the specific needs and circumstances of women and men, particularly through the use of gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting; 8. Is critical of the fact that gender mainstreaming in the current Lisbon Strategy is basically non-existent and calls on the Council and Commission to include a gender mainstreaming chapter in its post-Lisbon \u2018EU 2020\u2019 Strategy; 9. Calls on the National Equality Bodies to introduce integrated approaches in order to improve their response to and handling of cases of multiple discrimination; insists furthermore that National Equality Bodies establish training for judges lawyers and staff in identifying, preventing and responding to multiple discrimination; 10. Welcomes the fact that the target of a 60 % female employment rate by 2010, set at the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000, will soon be reached, but notes that a high proportion of the jobs concerned are, regrettably, insecure and poorly paid; deplores also the major disparities among the Member States, with rates ranging from 37,4 % to 74,3 %; asks the Member States, therefore, to take the measures needed in order to apply Directive 2006/54/EC effectively; 11. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to give consideration to the situation of spouses helping in handicrafts, trade, agriculture, fisheries and small family businesses, both from the gender equality perspective and taking into account the fact that women are in a more vulnerable position than men; calls on the Member States to develop the legal construct of shared ownership, in order to ensure full recognition of women\u2019s rights in the agricultural sector, appropriate protection in the field of social security and recognition of their work; 12. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to introduce measures and positive action to integrate women in projects and programmes on ecological transformation, i.e. in the renewables sector, and in science and technology-intensive jobs; 13. Encourages the Member States to promote female entrepreneurship in the industrial sector and to provide financial support, vocational guidance structures and appropriate training for women setting up companies; 14. Points out that women\u2019s personal income and paid employment remains key to their economic autonomy and to greater equality between women and men in society as a whole; underlines that in the light of the ageing society in particular, both men and women are needed in order to prevent labour shortage; 15. Notes that women are exposed to a higher risk of poverty because the gender pay gap has remained stubbornly wide and that there are many differences among the Member States in this regard; asks the Member States, therefore, to apply Directive 2006/54/EC immediately and, in particular, to promote the principal of \u2018equal pay for equal work\u2019 or that of \u2018work of equal value\u2019; 16. Considers that action should also be taken with a view to reducing pension disparities between women and men with regard to pensions, given that women still bear the bulk of family responsibilities, leading to discontinuous careers and, more generally, less professional involvement than men; 17. Deplores the fact that the Commission has not yet responded to the above-mentioned EP resolution of 18 November 2008 with a legislative proposal for revision of the existing legislation relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women; calls on the Commission, therefore, to present such a proposal without delay; EN C 341 E/40 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "18. Supports the Commission in the infringement proceedings it is taking in relation to transposition of the directives in force; considers that Member States which have not yet done so must transpose the gender equality directives without delay and, in particular, ensure that they are properly implemented; 19. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to run awareness-raising campaigns in schools, workplaces and the media in order to promote diversification of career choices, especially for girls and combat persistent sexist stereotyping and degrading images, with particular emphasis on campaigns that highlight men\u2019s role in better sharing of family responsibilities and in work-life balancing; 20. Calls on the Member States to acknowledge companies that take action to promote equality between women and men and facilitate work-life balance, in order to foster the spread of good practices in this area; 21. Emphasises the importance of pre-school childcare provision, child-minding services and the provision of assistance to elderly persons and other dependants for better work-life balancing; commends the Commission\u2019s approach of making available, in a timely manner, high-quality comparative statistics and in putting specific recommendations to each Member State; calls on the Member States to do their utmost to achieve the above-mentioned Barcelona European Council targets on pre-school childcare provision; 22. Congratulates the Commission on the steps it has taken and particularly on its proposals for revision of Directive 92/85/EEC in relation to maternity protection and Directive 86/613/EEC in relation to self- employed workers and \u2018assisting spouses\u2019 in family businesses; considers, however, that the Commission\u2019s proposed revision of Directive 92/85/EEC falls short of what would be desirable from the point of view of promoting work-life balance for men and women; 23. Maintains that paternity leave is an issue that needs to be addressed and calls on the Commission to support any moves to establish paternity-leave entitlement on a Europe-wide basis; believes that maternity leave should be linked to paternity leave so as to afford better protection to women on the labour market and in that way combat stereotypes within society regarding the uptake of leave in the latter category; 24. Asks the Member States and the social partners to encourage a better gender balance in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility; therefore calls for binding targets to ensure the equal representation of women and men; notes in this regard the positive effects of the use of electoral quotas on the representation of women; 25. Welcomes the Norwegian Government\u2019s decision to increase the number of women on the boards of private and public companies to at least 40 %, calls on the Commission and the Member States to take the Norwegian initiative as a positive example and to start moving in the same direction; 26. Calls on the Member States to launch campaigns aimed at female secondary school graduates to promote the choice of a career in engineering, in order to increase parity of women in traditional male technical professions; 27. Welcomes the significant increase in the numbers of female chairs of parliamentary committees and female EP vice-presidents as well as the less substantial, though nonetheless real, increase in the number of female MEPs following the June 2009 European elections; 28. Considers in this regard that the proportion of women Commissioners-designate (representing 33 % of the total) - achieved with great difficulty - is the bare minimum; is of the view that the composition of the Commission should better reflect the diversity of the European population, including the gender aspect; calls on Member States, in future nominations, to put forward two candidates, one of each gender, so as to facilitate the composition of a more representative Commission; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/41 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "29. Asks the Member States to scrutinise their policies on migration in order to put the skills of highly qualified migrants to better use and to provide social security cover for female workers in domestic and other sectors where it is not available, with a view to promoting the integration of migrants while also ensuring that they are given access to education and training, especially vocational training and courses in the language of their host country; 30. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to give priority to and take particular note of more vulnerable groups of women \u2013 disabled women, women with dependants, elderly women, minority and immigrant women and women prisoners \u2013 and to develop targeted measures to meet their needs; 31. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt and implement the necessary measures to support women with disabilities so that they may progress in those areas of social life and the world of work, culture and politics in which they are still under-represented; 32. Calls on the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Hungary, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden to act at once to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; 33. Points out that violence against women is still a major problem that needs to be eliminated using every means available to the Communities and the Member States, and once again calls on the Commission to establish a European Year for combating violence against women; congratulates the Spanish Presidency of the Council on making it a priority to combat such violence and invites future Council Presidents to do likewise; 34. Endorses the Spanish Presidency\u2019s proposals to introduce the European protection order for victims and a common EU-wide telephone helpline for victims; 35. Stresses the importance of combating violence against women to achieving equality between women and men; calls on the Commission to start drawing up a proposal for a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women, including trafficking; 36. Emphasises that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, notably through easy access to contraception and abortion; emphasises that women must have access free of charge to consultation on abortion; supports, therefore \u2013 as it did in its above-mentioned resolution of 3 September 2008 \u2013 measures and actions to improve women\u2019s access to sexual and reproductive health services and to raise their awareness of their rights and of available services; invites the Member States and the Commission to implement measures and actions to make men more aware of their responsibilities in relation to sexual and reproductive matters; 37. Notes that the European Institute for Gender Equality is still in the process of being established, and expects to see it fully operational as soon as possible; 38. Calls on the Commission to pursue its new \u2018Beyond GDP\u2019 strategy and to include in its work strategies to measure the contribution to Member States\u2019 GDP of work by women and men in the field of intergenerational solidarity; 39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission and to the governments of the Member States.

Urges the Commission and the Member States to support the listing of northern bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ) in CITES Appendix I subject to the following three conditions: \u2014 a guarantee that Commission Regulation (EC) No 865/2006 laying down detailed rules concerning the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein will be amended so as to introduce a general derogation for domestic trade, allowing traditional coastal fishing to continue; \u2014 provision of EU financial support for the seafarers and vessel owners affected by the decision; \u2014 introduction of tighter controls and tougher penalties to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; 5.

Is confident that Croatia will meet and overcome the considerable challenges remaining as regards the benchmarks set out in the negotiating chapters; points out that the country continues to pursue its reform efforts, in particular as regards the judiciary and public administration, the fight against corruption and organised crime, the promotion of minority rights including refugee return, the pursuit of war crimes trials and allowing the ICTY access to documents; considers that Croatia must also make substantial further efforts in completing the restructuring of shipyards; 4. Is concerned that, despite the broad support for EU accession existing among political parties, public support for EU membership is diminishing; notes that opinion polls suggest that the Croatian public remains less than enthusiastic about the EU, indicating that only one-third of the population consider EU accession to be beneficial; encourages the Croatian authorities and civil society to initiate more public discussions on EU membership and the consequences of accession to the Union; invites the Government and civil society to join forces to improve social reforms and speed up the implementation of reforms in the fields of the judiciary, public administration, the environment and economic policy; 5.

Welcomes the progress achieved in implementing the programme of public administration reform for the period 2008-2011 and in pursuing efforts with a clear government commitment; 7. Welcomes Croatia's participation in European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) operations and missions as well as its alignment with Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) declarations, common positions and statements whenever it is invited to join them; 8. Underlines, however, that major weaknesses remain in administrative procedures as well as in the management and administrative capacities of relevant institutions; considers that more overall political attention should be paid to the strengthening of the civil service; notes that the process of depoliticising the public administration is still at an early stage and that the legal framework for establishing a professional and efficient civil service is not yet completed; points out that a new salary system is required and that there needs to be more delegation of decision-making responsibilities from managerial to civil servant level; 9. Notes that, whilst the political will exists to combat corruption on all levels, and whilst the legal framework for fighting corruption is in place, corruption remains widespread and the administrative capacities of state bodies, including the police and law enforcement authorities, continue to be insufficient; urges the relevant authorities to tackle corruption cases since these involve nearly all segments of society, economy and government, including a nexus of institutions operating primarily in the areas of health care, the judiciary, local government, the urban planning and construction sector and business; is in particular concerned about cases of undue political influence over the judiciary; is pleased to note that the efforts of the Prime Minister and the government have been enhanced to combat corruption in state-owned companies, but considers that more has to be done to foster a culture of political accountability as regards corruption involving politicians; 10.

Points out, however, that despite the progress made more resolute steps are required to reform the judiciary, which continues to labour under, inter alia, the heavy backlog of cases and the excessive length of court proceedings; points out that significant work remains to be done concerning the strengthening of judicial independence, the creation of a more transparent selection procedure for judges and prosecutors and more efficient enforcement of court rulings; considers that further efforts are needed to meet these chal\u00ad lenges, in order also to avoid undermining citizens\u2019 confidence in the functioning of the judiciary and the rule of law; supports the legislative initiatives of the Ministry of Justice aimed at improving the nomination, selection and promotion of judges according to qualification and merit; 13. Takes note of the statement made by the Prosecutor of the ICTY before the United Nations Security Council on 3 December 2009 and encourages Croatia to fully cooperate with the ICTY; stresses that in his statement the Prosecutor, while acknowledging that Croatia continued to adequately respond to the majority of requests for assistance from the ICTY, reiterated that one concern has remained unresolved, notably the progress in finding the missing key military documents related to Operation Storm in 1995, which are to be used in the trials of some Generals; wishes all success to the newly created Inter-Agency Task Force, which is composed of representatives of various state institutions and agencies, to carry out these investigations; is of the view that a third party, if needed, may give further impetus to the investigations; invites the Council to decide as soon as possible on the opening of Chapter 23 on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights; encourages Croatia to address the issue of impunity of the perpetrators of war crimes and to make further progress in establishing impartiality in the conduct of domestic war crimes trials; EN C 341 E/50 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2010 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",

Notes that restitution of property seized during World War II and under the Communist regime has remained an issue, while acknowledging that progress has been made towards returning occupied private properties to their rightful owners, particularly as regards occupied agricultural land; 16.

Is pleased that the frequency and gravity of violent incidents against ethnic Serbs have diminished, police investigations have improved and the process of reconciliation between ethnic Croats and ethnic Serbs is proving to be successful; welcomes the fact that proposed changes to the Constitution are expected to recognise all minority groups in Croatia and that minority rights in the area of education have improved; is especially pleased to note the progress achieved in the inclusive education of Roma; calls on the Croatian authorities, however, to continue their efforts to combat discrimination against Roma and ethnic Serbs, primarily in the justice system, access to employment and housing; further encourages Croatia to continue to act in a spirit of tolerance and take appropriate measures to protect those who may still be subject to threats or acts of intimidation; 18. Encourages Croatia to continue its efforts to promote cultural diversity; 19. Welcomes the overall progress achieved in the field of refugee return and stresses the utmost importance of the return and reintegration of refugees, including the reconstruction and repossession of housing, the challenging implementation of housing programmes for former holders of tenancy rights and the steps to be taken to resolve the issue of validation of pension rights; takes note of the fact that Croatia\u2019s implementation of its 2009 housing programme is still at an early stage owing to the effects of the global economic crisis and to budget restrictions, and that the programme will need to continue in 2010 and perhaps beyond, requiring a sustained commitment on the part of the competent authorities; stresses that it is of the utmost importance to create conditions for sustainability in the areas of return; invites the Croatian Government to align its immigration and asylum policies with EU standards; 20. Calls on the Government to provide training for the judiciary on the implementation of the Gender Equality Law (GEL) and the Anti-Discrimination Law; notes that, so far, not one judicial decision has been based on either of those laws; while it welcomes the appointment of a woman as prime minister, it calls for more active promotion of the participation of women in politics, noting that the proportion of women decreased in all local government bodies in this year\u2019s local elections (for example, the number of female \u2018zupans\u2019 fell from three to one); highlights the need to step up efforts to support victims of family violence; notes the progress made by Croatia in the area of hate crime legislation and encourages the government to make further efforts to ensure that an appropriate legal framework is in place, as well as to address discrimination against sexual minorities, including thorough the investigation of hate crimes and threats; 21.

Draws attention to the need to address shortcomings as regards persons with disabilities, in particular by tackling existing gaps in legislation, policy making and service delivery for the disabled, especially those with mental disabilities; EN 16.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 341 E/51 Wednesday 10 February 2010 ",
        "Economic criteria 23. Is pleased to note that Croatia is gradually recovering from the economic crisis and that its economic outlook is relatively positive despite rising unemployment; notes that macro-economic stability has been preserved, that a smaller current account deficit is now forecast, that external imbalances have narrowed and that the banking sector has remained sound; also notes that the perspective of EU accession has helped investors to retain confidence in the Croatian economy and has provided an anchor for economic policies in the recent turbulent period; 24. Calls on the Government, however, to address the existing structural weaknesses in the economy, which necessitate deeper and faster structural reforms as a precondition for sustainable economic growth; urges the state to reduce its strong redistributive role and to further limit state intervention in the economy, to stimulate employment by reviving the somewhat rigid labour market, to remove administrative barriers for enterprises and to cut subsidies to loss-making industries; Assuming the obligations of EU membership 25. Is pleased to note that Croatia has improved its ability to take on the obligations of EU membership, with a good degree of alignment with the acquis communautaire in most sectors; encourages the Croatian authorities, however, to further reinforce the administrative structures and institutional capacities necessary for the proper implementation of the acquis , so that the country may maximise the benefits of EU membership after accession; 26.

Notes with satisfaction the good overall progress achieved in financial control, particularly with regard to the legislation governing internal financial control, while pointing to the need to achieve more progress in the area of external audit by strengthening, inter alia, the legal framework for the independence of the State Audit Office; points out that the transparency of public finance is of crucial importance in combating corruption and improving the efficiency of public services, as it facilitates control over public authorities, which again has a positive impact on their responsibility to citizens; 30. Welcomes the progress made in the implementation of the IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession) components, which prepare the country to manage the Structural Funds; calls on the Croatian authorities, nevertheless, to substantially increase administrative capacities in existing IPA structures so as to meet the regulatory and operational requirements of the EU's cohesion policy and to guarantee its funds\u2019 absorption capacity, notably through the programming of the National Strategic Reference Framework and Operational Programmes for the Structural Funds; 31.

Recalls the arbitration agreement reached between the Prime Ministers of Slovenia and Croatia with a view to resolving their border dispute; welcomes the ratification of the agreement by the Croatian Parliament and hopes that the Slovenian Parliament will do likewise in the very near future; in this respect, requests that the Commission establish a list of members of the arbitration tribunal, comprising only highly qualified professionals with a legal background and, as far as possible, experience in arbitration; 36.

        "U. whereas the many insults, threats and attacks directed against national and international leaders by President Ch\u00e1vez have given rise to unease and a huge number of unnecessary tensions, which in some cases have even led to an order for the mobilisation of troops with a view to a possible war with Colombia, 1.
