        "Annual Report 2008 3 Investment Facility A word from the Vice-President In many respects, 2008 was a year of change. Some changes were predictable, such as the mid-year entry into force of the revised Cotonou Partnership Agreement, and of its associated financial protocol, the 10th European Development Fund. Others came more unexpectedly, such as the financial and food crises, which triggered fundamental changes in the global economy and in the ACPs/OCTs respec- tively. The full impact of these upheavals remains to be seen, but first signs are already evident. Against this unstable economic and social backdrop, the additional resources provided by the new finan- cial protocol (10th EDF) will help the Bank to respond in a more flexible and innovative manner to invest- ment needs in the ACPs and OCTs for the period 2008- 2013. In 2008, in spite of the challenges and negative exter- nal events affecting the regions of operation, the Bank managed to balance its portfolio sectorally, geographi- cally and financially, in line with the orientations and objectives of the Cotonou Agreement. The bulk of investments went into promoting infra- structure projects and the development of the finan- cial and private sectors, notably small businesses which are at the heart of economic growth. Regional inte- gration, support for projects that deliver sustainable economic, social and environmental benefits and coop- eration with local and bilateral/multilateral stakehold- ers also remained centre stage. Throughout the year, the Bank paid particular attention to ensuring trans- parency and a positive developmental impact across all its operations. Nonetheless, greater uncertainties lie ahead. As the credit crunch gradually begins to take effect in countries where exposure to the world economy is limited, the Bank stands ready to play a catalytic role in the ACPs and OCTs, encouraging the funding of private sector projects. In 2009 and beyond, the EIB will con- tinue to apply best practice standards, closely monitor its project portfolio and apply stringent criteria in its screening of potential new projects. I am confident that the EIB has the capacity to play a fundamental role in supporting the ACP and OCT regions through the difficult financial times which we now face. The Bank remains committed to utilis- ing and building upon its broad range of innovative financial instruments and expertise with the aim of fostering infrastructure and financial sector develop- ment \u2013 the key drivers of sustained growth and private sector expansion.

        "Annual Report 2008 8 Investment Facility The European Investment Bank (EIB) supports the Euro- pean Union\u2019s (EU) cooperation and development poli- cies in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States 1 . Currently, the EIB operates in these regions under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement signed in June 2000 in Cotonou, Benin, for a period of twenty years, and revised in 2005. The Agreement between the ACP States and the European Community and its Member States is based on various instruments to reduce pov- erty in the ACPs. Member States\u2019 budgets Financing under the Agreement is provided from EU Member States\u2019 budgets and is disbursed according to financial protocols defined for successive five- to six-year periods.

        "Annual Report 2008 9 Investment Facility In managing the ACP and OCT Investment Facilities, the grants for technical assistance and interest subsi- dies and its own resources, the EIB seeks to bring value added. The EIB concentrates its efforts on fostering private sector-led initiatives that promote economic growth and have a positive impact on the wider com- munity and region. The EIB also supports public sector projects, typically in infrastructure, that are critical for private sector development and the creation of a com- petitive business environment. In line with the objectives set out by the international community in the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the EIB\u2019s overriding aim is to support projects that deliver sustainable economic, social and environmental benefits whilst ensuring strict accountability for public funds.

        "Annual Report 2008 10 Investment Facility Operational highlights for 2008 Following the completion of its ratification process, the revised Cotonou Partnership Agreement, Cotonou II, and its associated financial protocol, the 10 th EDF, entered into force on 1 July 2008. The protocol covers the period 2008-2013 and provides the Bank with additional resources to fulfil its mandate. Signed ACP IF commitments during the year totalled EUR 326 3m, compared with EUR 314.6m in 2007. In 2008, IF and own resources-funded infrastructure projects covering the water, energy, telecommunications and transport sectors, accounted for 63% of signatures, the largest share of the portfolio. Operations targeting financial services and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including facilities for microfinance, represented the second largest share with 30% of signatures. The remainder of the portfolio covered ventures in the industrial sector. Projects promoted by private sector operators accounted for 41% of signatures. 24% of overall portfolio signatures encompassed a regional dimension or activities aimed at supporting the development of cross-border and regional initiatives. In line with its strategy for operations in the financial sector, the Bank\u2019s focus was not so much to provide funds as to promote change through contributing to financial sector development. It aimed to fill market gaps and act as a catalyst, thereby going beyond SME finance. In relying on a broader range and alternative financial instruments, exploring new market segments, emphasising the role of technical assistance and promoting capac- ity building, the Bank pursued the objective of providing \u201cfinance for growth\u201d which, ultimately, should encourage access to \u201cfinance for all\u201d.

        "Annual Report 2008 12 Investment Facility Investment conditions in ACP countries \u201cA changing environment\u201d Sub-Saharan Africa Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expected to slow in the face of the financial turmoil, even though many SSA countries have benefited from terms-of-trade gains resulting from the surge in com- modity prices. Overall, growth is projected to decline from nearly 7% in 2007 to just over 5% in 2008\u20132009. However, there are important cross-country variations. Due to a weakening external environment, economic expansion in oil-exporting countries is expected to slow down in 2008\u20132009, with growth declining to about 7% from nearly 8% in 2007. For oil importers, the terms of trade would remain broadly stable in 2008, with oil price developments offset by price increases in metals, coffee, cocoa, and cotton. Recent sharp increases in food and fuel prices have posed significant challenges for price stability across SSA. Inflation is expected to rise from about 7% in 2007 to almost 12% in 2008, before easing again to around 9% in 2009. Food price rises tend to have a large impact on inflation in most SSA countries, reflecting a high share of food in consumer baskets. Domestic demand pressures, which have emerged in some SSA countries during the past several years of robust growth, may also be amplifying the initial impact of food and fuel price shocks through second-round effects on inflation. The impact of higher food prices on poverty is a major concern as it risks undermining past progress in this area and puts social cohesion at risk. Many SSA countries\u2019 strong dependence on imports of food and fuel as well as a high incidence of poverty make them most vulnera- ble to increases in the prices of these commodities. Popu- lations in these countries have few options to hedge against rising food prices, and the urban poor tend to suffer most. A recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) study estimates that rising prices for imported food would have the largest impact on poverty in Gambia, Ghana, Mauritainia and Swaziland owing to their high dependence on imports and low incomes. ",
        "Annual Report 2008 13 Investment Facility The external positions of net oil-importing countries have also come under pressure because of the surg- ing prices of imported fuel. Current account deficits in these countries are projected to deteriorate on aver- age from about 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2007 to around 6% of GDP in 2008 and 2009. In South Africa, a widening current account deficit, which stood at 7.25% of GDP in the second quarter of 2008, is of par- ticular concern. The deficit is financed largely through volatile portfolio flows, although low external debt and a flexible exchange rate should provide some resilience if capital flows were to reverse. By contrast, current account balances in net oil-exporting countries are in surplus and are projected to strengthen further, from 8% in 2007 to more than 10% in 2008 before bounc- ing back in 2009. The main challenge for the region is to respond to the large commodity price shock and the threat of slow- ing capital inflows. Oil-importing countries, where the negative terms-of-trade shock has weakened fiscal and external positions, need to adjust their monetary, fiscal, and income policies. Delaying the adjustment would jeopardise macroeconomic stabil- ity and the recent achievements in improving policy and institutional frameworks, which have been largely responsible for SSA\u2019s impressive growth performance in recent years. Aside from the impact of oil and other commodities (see box 1), the relatively good external positions of most countries have also been a result of prudent macroeco- nomic frameworks that have been adopted in recent years, partly to satisfy the prerequisites of HIPC 4 . More broadly, HIPC and MDRI 5 have contributed to sig- nificantly reducing the region\u2019s debt overhang. This has led to an overall improvement in financial conditions and corresponding sovereign ratings and a reduction of the relative risk perceived by investors in the region. Accordingly, foreign investment inflows to the region have progressed quite rapidly. While the last few years have brought economic growth back to the region, poverty remains wide- spread and in fact only a small minority of countries appears to be on track to meet the Millennium Devel- opment Goals. Although the number of open military conflicts appears to be waning and political stability is on the rise, the region still occupies the majority of top positions in indicators such as the 2008 Failed States Index published by the Washington-based Fund for Peace \u2013 seven of the top ten countries in the index are in sub-Saharan Africa: Somalia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Central African Republic (in decreasing order of vio- lent internal conflicts). 4 The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries programme, initiated by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996, pro- vides debt relief and low- interest loans to reduce external debt repayments to sustainable levels. 5 The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) pro- vides for 100% debt relief on eligible debt from three multilateral institutions \u2013 the IMF, the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, and the African Develop- ment Fund (AfDF) \u2013 to a group of low income coun- tries that have reached, or will eventually reach, the completion point under the joint IMF-World Bank enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative).

        "Annual Report 2008 14 Investment Facility Box 1: Commodity Prices and Current Account in ACP Countries Weakening global demand is depressing commodity prices. Oil prices have declined by over 50% since their peak, retreating to levels not seen since early 2007 \u2013 reflecting the major global downturn, the strengthening of the US dollar, and the financial crisis \u2013 despite the decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce production. Similarly, met- als and food prices have fallen from their recent peaks. While this eases the burden on house- holds in advanced economies, it lowers growth prospects in many other emerging economies and commodity exporter countries. The combination of stabilising commodity prices and increasing economic slack will help to con- tain inflation pressures in advanced and emerging economies. However, in a number of these countries, inflation risks are still manifest, as higher commodity prices and continued pressure on local supply conditions have affected wage demands and inflation expectations. For many ACP countries, trade is their main channel of exposure to a global downturn, in par- ticular trade of commodities, the prices of which are declining sharply. The impact of declining commodity prices differs depending on the profile of ACP countries. A few countries benefited from high commodity prices, resulting in strong current account surpluses, reserve accumu- lation and improved fiscal accounts. Angola and Chad, for example, experienced a massive increase in their current accounts in 2008, however the decline in commodity prices will be hard felt in the most fragile countries. Chad\u2019s current account will slide from a surplus of 10% of GDP to a deficit of about 2%. In Nigeria, the current account will decline from a surplus of 6% of GDP to zero, with a significant impact on the 2009 budget, which assumes oil prices well above current levels. Resource-rich ACP countries may also experience a reversal of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in mining and oil sectors, further depressing growth prospects in 2009. Resource-poor countries were severely hit by rising import bills of food and energy in 2008. Plagued with widening current account deficits, inflation and a weakened international reserves position, they gain some relief from the recent decline in commodity prices. However, the global slowdown has dented their exports of textile and other manufactured goods, reducing growth and employment. Source: Global Insight.

One commonly cited measure that attempts to characterise the prevailing business environments is the set of Doing Business Indicators (DBIs) compiled by the World Bank.

        "Annual Report 2008 16 Investment Facility Caribbean countries Back in 2006, regional growth was supported by the strong performance of construction and tourism and reached an average of 7.8%. Growth rates decreased to 5.6% in 2007 and are expected to drop further in 2008 and 2009, reaching 3.7% and 2.9% respectively, reflecting the negative impact of the developments in the United States (USA) on remittances, trade, and tourism, as well as high fuel costs. The deceleration of the USA and European econo- mies is expected to be felt mainly via real economy channels like lower trade, tourism and remittances. A slowdown in tourism-related real estate and con- struction activity would not only have a direct impact on growth and employment, but it would also rever- berate through the banking system via heightened credit risk. Even in countries like Barbados, with a sound and profitable banking sector, banks are vul- nerable to such credit quality shocks. Moreover, the growing pool of non-bank financial intermediar- ies remains largely unregulated across the region. Therefore, it is difficult to gauge how deeply they may be affected. Under the present unsettled circumstances, external imbalances are another important source of vulner- ability, often coupled with large fiscal deficits and high public debt. Caribbean countries typically have a relatively narrow export base and depend upon remittances and capital inflows to finance their cur- rent account deficits. When FDI inflows are not large enough to cover the deficit, countries are left exposed to adverse developments in the global economy and setbacks in financial markets. The Dominican Repub- lic has proven particularly vulnerable in this respect. In Jamaica, while the banking system is generally sound, credit growth of nearly 30% and the existence of unregulated investment schemes are a cause for con- cern. In St Vincent and the Grenadines, the asset quality and capital adequacy of banks have recently improved. However, increasing competition from non-bank finan- cial institutions and rapid credit growth could result in a deterioration of the loan portfolio at a time when global credit markets are strained. A similar problem could affect countries like Antigua and Barbuda to an even greater extent, where the financial system already displays substantial vulnerabilities, including high ratios of non-performing loans. In the Bahamas, tight exchange control regulations isolate domestic banks from the large offshore financial sector, and hence should somewhat protect them from the glo- bal financial turmoil. Pacific islands In 2007 and 2008, the economies of the Pacific region grew by about 5.5%, partly due to high commod- ity prices. Papua New Guinea recovered from the fis- cal crisis and its current account is in surplus due to a booming mining sector. After economic collapse, the Solomon Islands are experiencing high economic growth combined with a government budget surplus and rapidly declining public debt. Inflation remains a regional concern due to higher costs for imported fuel. In 2008, inflation is projected to have exceeded 6% compared to less than 3% in 2006 and 2007. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were particularly affected, with inflation rates jumping from single fig- ures in 2007 to more than 14% in 2008, mainly driven by high food and oil prices. Because of their narrow production bases, the Pacific islands are dependent on imported goods, mainly from Australia and New Zealand. Apart from Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, trade deficits are a regu- lar feature of these countries\u2019 balance of payments. Private transfers and remittances from nationals liv- ing overseas contribute to offsetting trade deficits, as in Samoa and Tonga. More broadly, official transfers have provided substantial support across the region. High commodity prices weigh positively on Papua New Guinea\u2019s current account with a surplus increas- ing steadily to reach 4.3% of GDP in 2007. Similarly, ",

        "Annual Report 2008 18 Investment Facility Box 2: Economic vulnerabilities in ACP countries to the financial crisis The overwhelming majority of ACP countries have avoided direct contamina tion from the type of \u201ctoxic assets\u201d found in a large number of financial institutions in advanced economies. Still, the crisis\u2019 impact on trade, capital flows, remittances and commodity prices is exposing some pre-existing eco- nomic vulnerabilities in these countries, which can be grouped according to the following five differ- ent risk categories: \u2022 Direct liquidity vulnerability: countries with a low ratio of short-term liquid external assets over liq - uid external liabilities run the risk of a liquidity crisis due to asset revaluations. \u2022 Short-term capital inflow/remittances dependence: these sources of balance of payments financing are likely to be severely affected by a slowdown in advanced economies, making excessive reliance on them risky. \u2022 Export dependence: for many ACP countries, trade is their main channel of exposure to a global downturn, in particular trade of commodities, the prices of which are declining sharply, and GDP- elastic services like tourism. \u2022 Fiscal vulnerability: fiscal vulnerabilities become even more risky during a global downturn because of potential revenue shortfalls, or a need to bail out financial institutions or provide stimulus. \u2022 Domestic financial market vulnerability: pre-existing weaknesses in the domestic financial system also become more critical in the light of increased risk aversion and growth slowdown 1 . Risk profiles in the various ACP regions are illus- trated in the radar chart on the right with risk cate- gories represented by the five spokes and risk levels increasing outwards. In sub-Saharan Africa, the financial sectors of a number of commodity producing countries \u2013 not ably oil producers \u2013 have expanded very rapidly during the recent price boom and could thus be exposed to a significant economic turnaround. Many SSA coun- tries also face the risk of a reversal of short-term capital flows and/or remittances as well as a risk of deteriorating exports. The latter two risks are even higher in the Caribbean region, where some coun- tries also display a relatively high direct liquidity risk and generally have less fiscal intervention space than SSA countries. The main risks for the Pacific region lie in its dependence on exports \u2013 mainly tourism but also some commodities 2 . The table below presents the principal vulnerability data for a selected group of ACP countries and South Africa. 1 BIS research (Borio, 2003, \u201cTowards a macroprudential framework for financial supervision and regulation?\u201d BIS Working Papers No 128) identifies excessive growth of credit to the private sector as a first indication for such vulnerabilities. 2 The average risk profile for advanced economies is also depicted for comparison.

        "Annual Report 2008 20 Investment Facility Box 3: The \u201cPartnership for Making Finance Work for Africa\u201d Contributing to the development of local financial sectors in ACP countries is one of the core objectives of the Cotonou Investment Facility. It was therefore quite natural for the Bank to join the \u201cMaking Finance Work for Africa\u201d Partnership (MFW4A), which was launched at the initiative of the German Government and has received strong support from the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and a number of bilateral donors/agencies (from France, Sweden, UK, US). The formal launch of the Partnership took place in Washington in October 2007. The main purpose of the MFW4A is to bring together public and private sector stakeholders with an interest in the development of Africa\u2019s financial sector. It has three main strategic objec- tives, namely: \u2022 to expand access to financial services to all sectors of the economy: as measured by the number of firms or households with access to quality financial services; \u2022 to increase financial depth, diversity and efficiency, as indicated by the ratio of credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP, interest margins and indicators of capital market and other non-bank financial sectors; and \u2022 to strengthen institutional and regulatory capacity, as measured by business environment and other institutional development indicators. Beyond these broad objectives, the Partnership aims to foster harmonisation around common priorities, to improve knowledge of financial sector issues, to increase awareness and to foster policy dialogue on these matters. There is scope in particular to enhance cooperation among stakeholders in order to create synergies, avoid duplication, share good practices and reduce transaction costs, in the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Partnership is meant to be an open forum, a clearing house where various stakeholders can share ideas and knowledge. A Partnership Secretariat, now hosted by the AfDB, supports and coordinates the activities of the Partnership. The first MFW4A annual forum took place in June 2008 in Accra, where it brought together some 300 senior-level financial sector representatives from across the region, including government and central bank officials, bank and financial sector executives, consultants, researchers and international experts.

        "Annual Report 2008 21 Investment Facility large oil and gas revenues have led to a sizeable cur- rent account surplus in Timor-Leste, which amounted to 250% of GDP in 2007 and is expected to stay above 200% of GDP in 2008. On the other hand, Fiji experi- enced significant current account deficits (15.5% of GDP in 2007, expected to increase to more than 20% of GDP in 2008), partly reflecting weak export perform- ance following the loss of preferential access for their textile and sugar production. In terms of fiscal performance, Papua New Guinea experienced a surplus for the third consecutive year in 2007 (6% of GDP). In Timor-Leste, government spending increased sharply on the back of emergency assistance programmes, damage repair and quick-dis- bursing grants for rural communities. Yet oil royalties pushed fiscal surpluses to 240% of GDP in 2007 and an expected 230% of GDP in 2008. In Fiji, the policy frame- work for 2007 reaffirmed the government\u2019s intention to narrow the deficit \u2013 which stood at 1 2% of GDP in 2007 \u2013 over the medium term. Future economic development hinges on sustained structural reforms. Business investment remains con- strained by problems related to land tenure, access, and utilisation. These are particularly detrimental to foreign private investment, notably in non-mineral sectors. Economic growth would also benefit from increased financial intermediation, which is often carried out, if at all, by foreign banks. The small size of these econo- mies, the lifestyles of their rural populations, and their modest economic growth rates are reflected in rela- tively simple financial systems.

Looking ahead Despite limited integration into the world economy and the modest devel- opment of local capital markets, the ACP partner countries have not remained immune to the extraordinary eco- nomic developments of recent months in advanced economies (see box n\u00b0 2). Growth is slowing down, as reduced glo- bal demand leads to lower commodity prices and a shortage of foreign invest- ment. The economic outlook for ACP countries is also clouded by the poten- tial impact of worsening conditions in the advanced economies on the demand for tourism services, and on remittance flows to developing countries. Possi- ble reduction in Official Development Assistance (ODA) would also play neg- atively on growth prospects. ACP coun- tries should nonetheless benefit from significantly positive growth over the medium-term on the back of domestic consumption and investment activity, reflecting the improved debt profiles and business environments of a signifi- cant number of ACP countries achieved during the last few years.

Signatures under the IF during 2008 totalled EUR 326m in the ACPs, to which can be added EUR 225m from the Bank\u2019s own resources, bringing the overall figure for new signatures in the ACPs to a total of EUR 551m (see the following table for the list of operations signed in 2008. Detailed lists of cumulative signatures since the inception of the Cotonou mandate are presented in Annexes 1 and 2). In the OCTs, the corresponding amount totalled EUR 10m in 2008. Disbursements under the IF in 2008 reached EUR 218m, bringing total disbursements on a cumulative basis to the equivalent of 49% and 72% of the signed portfo - lio in terms of volume and number of contracts, respec- tively. Disbursements under the Bank\u2019s own resources reached EUR 229m in 2008 for the ACPs, bringing total disbursements to the equivalent of 44% of signed com - mitments. Throughout 2008, the Bank concentrated its efforts on those operations to which it could bring the high- est value added. By focusing on ambitious and some- times difficult projects, the Bank contributed to turning fairly risky and pioneering initiatives into bankable and sustainable undertakings. By offering products not available from other sources, be it long-term finance in local and/or foreign currencies or risk capital, the Bank encouraged new opportunities, sending a positive sig- nal to other investors. Through its non-financial contri- butions, involving such aspects as the improvement of project design, environmental and social assessment and the provision of technical assistance, the Bank also promoted the legitimacy of a number of projects, gen- erating demonstration and catalytic effects.

        "Annual Report 2008 24 Investment Facility Box 4: Transparency and accountability Conscious of the core issue of aid effectiveness and the follow-up of the Paris Declaration and sub- sequent events, as well as its accountability for the mandate that has been entrusted to it by the EU Member States under the Cotonou Agreement, the Bank\u2019s revised \u201cStatement of Environmental and Social Principles and Standards\u201d addresses a number of these issues. In addition, it has initiated a dia- logue with peer institutions to further reinforce coordination and cooperation throughout the project cycle, including upstream project identification, joint appraisal and monitoring. Added value has always been a cornerstone of EIB lending policy, both within and outside the Euro- pean Union. The Economic and Social Impact Assessment Framework (ESIAF), contributes to this objective, by identifying the value added of projects from the outset, based on the assessment made by Bank\u2019s staff at the appraisal stage according to the three pillars mentioned in the following table. Acknowledging the need to fine-tune further its methodology so as to promote sustainable develop- ment and align its development standards and goals with those of other international institutions, the Bank has started to ramp up its qualitative assessment of projects at both the appraisal and implemen - tation stage through enhanced monitoring and reporting. Starting in 2008, ESIAF has been systematically applied to benchmark all IF and own resources opera- tions appraised, whether investment loans or financial sector operations. The outcome for projects approved in 2008 is reflected in the table below: Impact High Med- ium Low Pillar 1 Consistency with the objectives of the Bank\u2019s mandate under the Cotonou Agreement 17 4 - Pillar 2 Quality and soundness of projects (economic, environmental, social, financial and institutional) - Financial sector 2 9 - - Non-financial sector 4 6 - Pillar 3 EIB contribution or additionality (both financial and non-financial) 12 9 - Three projects out of the twenty-one approved 1 during the year received a \u201chigh\u201d rating on all three pillars, including the Inga Power Rehabilitation Project and Dominican Republic Financing Facility (refer to boxes 6 and 8), both being landmark projects for the countries concerned.

For all four operations, the Bank never- theless played a catalytic role and provided flexible instruments involving the sharing of risks 1 . 1 This box refers to projects approved in 2008. Projects signed in 2008 may have been appraised prior to 2008 and, consequently, have not systematically had the ESIAF applied to them. ",
        "Annual Report 2008 25 Investment Facility The rating of pillar 2 focuses on the expected quality of projects, i.e. the extent to which they consti - tute a rational allocation of resources and meet the needs of their beneficiaries, including society at large. Projects are benchmarked according to: \u2022 their economic and financial sustainability (the economic rate of return, environmental externalities generated, the financial rate of return); \u2022 their environmental sustainability, including their ability to comply with the Bank\u2019s Social and Envi - ronmental Statement; \u2022 other qualitative elements such as the project\u2019s design, its contribution to social and economic devel - opments, including MDGs, the promoter\u2019s ability to deliver the project, governance issues, mitigation measures foreseen etc. Mitigating negative externalities In 2008, the Derba Midroc Cement project received a \u201cmedium\u201d rating on pillar II (see page 36 for the project\u2019s description). This rating is linked to the fact that both positive and negative externalities are generated by the project. However, from the outset, satisfactory mitigation arrangements have been planned to counter negative aspects, notably linked to displacement of the local population. Early public consultations have been instrumental in identifying appropriate environmental and social compensation measures. The project will contribute to generating positive outputs such as, amongst others, creating employment, limiting rural exodus in the region, extending access to health, educa- tion and communication facilities for both its employees and local communities and satisfying unmet cement demand, a bottleneck to the country\u2019s economic growth. Emphasising economic and social development When considering a project, the Bank carefully balances financial and economic considerations with the project\u2019s expected social and development impact. The Jirama Water II project (described on page 28) illustrates such a weighing-up process. Although the project does not generate the highest finan- cial internal rate of return nor benefit from the strongest management, its impact on poverty reduc- tion outweighs such considerations. The project\u2019s contribution to the MDGs, its indirect contribution to health and social development and its expected impact on institutional strengthening fully justify its \u201chigh\u201d pillar II rating.

Railway lines and port access will be improved, contributing to poverty reduction and enterprise development in the sub-region (Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and South Africa); \u2022 the financing of environmental and social components of the Gouina Hydro Power Project, a priority project identified by The New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) to sup- port multipurpose water resources development among the four riparian countries of the Sen- egal River Basin, namely, Senegal, Mali, Mauritania and Guinea. The project will foster regional growth and improve the living conditions of inhabitants of the basin. The blending of grants provided by the Fund, alongside long-term loan finance made available by the EIB and by European development finance institutions (EDFIs), was paramount in accel- erating the financing of these four ambitious undertakings. Portugal joined the Fund in 2008 and the Commission increased its initial contribution, bringing the Fund\u2019s financial commitments to EUR 146.7m. Finland announced its intention to become a donor in early 2009. The Secretariat of the Fund, housed at the EIB, actively contributed to facilitating the first full year of operation by preparing Trust Fund Executive Committee and Project Financiers Group meetings, releasing the first Annual Report of the Fund, launching an interactive website ( http:// eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net) and monitoring discussions on the initial review of the Agree- ment. The Secretariat, in collaboration with the EIB, has also worked to enhance the Fund\u2019s vis- ibility, notably by publishing a Trust Fund brochure, drafting articles and press releases as well as attending/hosting high level meetings and expert workshops. 1 \u201cClearance in principle\u201d refers to an initial decision on the eligibility of a given project and its related grant operation.

Jirama 6 , the country\u2019s water and electricity provider, suffered from this delay. Overhauling the company and restoring the sustainability of its services has become a priority for the Government, and the IF loan will sup- port this institutional restructuring, already instigated by the donor community under the leadership of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and the World Bank. Alongside a grant from the EU Water Facility, the project also supports the improvement and expansion of the existing water distribution network. The project will provide drinking water at social tariffs to an additional 500 000 poor urban dwellers, mostly in the under- served outskirts of the country\u2019s capital, Antananarivo. By providing quality services and widespread access to drinking water, the project will help reduce the inci- dence of water-borne disease and release women and children from water drudgery. The extension of water supply services should facilitate the development of infrastructure for other basic services such as health- care and education, as well as new industrial zones, contributing to local employment and impacting posi- tively on the region\u2019s economy. The service level, and related cost to the users, will be established within the framework of a working group. This group, set up by the Ministry, encompasses mem- bers from several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private sector providers of water, already active in the peri-urban areas of Antananarivo. Their involvement will ensure that the interests of the local communities are taken into account at an early stage, while allowing for a harmonisation of water tariffs in the different areas of the capital.

The project builds on a previous extension of the drinking water network of Ouagadougou, including the construction of the Ziga dam 7 . In line with the Sanitation National Plan (PN-AEPA), under which the Authorities of Burkina Faso have established guidelines and priorities in planning water supply works, the project involves an increase in the pumping and treatment capacity of the Ziga dam, as well as an extension of the distribution network. The project will improve the living conditions of the population of the capital and suburban districts by providing a safe, affordable and reliable water sup- ply through either household connections or better access to public fountains. It will bear other positive social benefits, notably by reducing risks of water- borne diseases and freeing time for income-earning opportunities and school. Given its status as a HIPC country, the loan extended to the Government from the EIB\u2019s own resources ben- efits from an interest rate subsidy. The Government will on-lend the funds to the Office National de l\u2019Eau et de l\u2019Assainissement (ONEA), the public utility entrusted with the supply and distribution of drinking water in urban areas. Part of the subsidy will be spent to strengthen ONEA\u2019s commercial, technical and financial management, and complements technical assistance financed by the AFD. Co-financing is provided by the EU, the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO). Senegal: Assainissement Dakar Since the 1970s, the natural environment of Hann Bay, a beach located south-east of Dakar, has deteriorated, owing to the construction of many industrial facilities and uncontrolled urban development. The discharge of substantial volumes of sewage and solid waste without prior treatment exacerbates the damage to the envi- ronment and generates negative economic and social impacts on the local economy. The cleaning up of Hann Bay has been singled out by the Authorities as a priority operation under Senegal\u2019s Drinking Water and Sewage Programme for the Millennium (PEPAM). This wastewater initiative is the first industrial pollu- tion abatement programme to be implemented in Sen- egal. As the first phase of the programme, the project focuses on restoring water quality in the bay, notably by setting up industrial and domestic wastewater collec- tion, household connections, a water treatment plant and a sea outfall. The inhabitants of the bay, estimated at over 55 000 people, will benefit from significantly reduced health risks stemming from the discharge of untreated effluents into the natural environment. By enhancing the bay\u2019s water quality and environment, it will foster the development of income-generating activities, particularly in the areas of tourism and fish- ing, thus helping to reduce poverty and improving the living conditions of the local population. Given its implications for the institutional and regu- latory aspects of the urban water and sanitation sec- tors, the project is likely to have a powerful leverage effect on the reform of these sectors, accelerating the achievement of the MDGs in Senegal. The EIB is extending a loan from its own resources to the Senegalese Government for on-lending to l\u2019Office National de l\u2019Assainissement du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (ONAS), the state-owned company responsible for operating the urban sanitation public utilities. Given Senegal\u2019s sta- tus as a highly indebted poor country, the loan is cou- pled to an interest rate subsidy. The EIB and the AFD, co-financiers of the project, also provide support and technical assistance measures, notably to strengthen ONAS\u2019s institutional and management/monitoring capacities.

The project, covering Malawi\u2019s two largest cities, Blan- tyre and Lilongwe, aims at providing safe and sustain- able water supply and sanitation services to more than half a million people, two thirds of whom are in the low-income category. It will create an access-to-water facility (AWF) to facilitate payments for the connection fee, as this is the main obstacle to network access for poor households. Funding will be provided for the rehabilitation and expansion of essential water facilities (pipes, pumps, distribution network, etc.) as well as institutional capac- ity building initiatives to address the operational inef- ficiencies and investment needs of the Water Boards of the two cities. The project implementation will involve a private sector service contract covering both Water Boards so as to ensure the sustainability of the invest- ments and transfers of expertise. The project benefits from strong donor coordination in Malawi with respect to reform of the sector and support for its gradual opening to private operators, including local entrepreneurs. It promotes a demand- driven and participatory approach to project design with the direct involvement of NGOs and community- based organisations. The loan extended by the EIB from its own resources benefits from an interest subsidy for the financing of investment components targeting the urban poor. It is combined with an EU grant from the EU Water Facility. ",

Accordingly, by putting people in contact, generating new business opportunities, link- ing remote and rural areas to markets and fostering regional integration, enhanced telecommunication services are essential in stimulating the development of the region. In extending a loan to the private mobile phone opera- tor Digicel (Digicel Pacific Limited), the IF supports the development, upgrading and expansion of competi- tive Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications networks in a number of Pacific Island States, no tably in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. By introducing more competition, Digicel will contribute to enhanc- ing the quality and coverage of the mobile network. The project should also trigger tariff cuts for the under- served lower-income groups and improve the quality of related services. It will generate additional jobs for the local population (around 400 direct jobs and more than 2 000 indirect jobs) and encourage a transfer of skills to the region. Under the guidance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the promoter has developed and implemented an environmental and social handbook throughout its operations in the Pacific.

It will also help prepare the ground for additional hydro- electric capacity, a high government priority, through two feasibility studies, one on a related storage dam and the other on a new hydropower plant. While addressing the acute shortage of electricity in Madagascar, the project will also support the increase of environmentally-friendly and competitive indig- enous hydro-electricity, thereby contributing to the country\u2019s overall sustainable economic develop- ment. To bring the final interest rate in line with the country\u2019s debt sustainability obligations, the own resources loan extended by the Bank to the Government for on-lend- ing to Jirama benefits from an interest rate subsidy. This, the Bank\u2019s fifth operation carried out with Jirama since 1987, will benefit from project-related technical assistance partly directed towards Jirama and partly to other stakeholders in the energy sector, such as the regulator. The project is instrumental in supporting the continued reform and restructuring of both the sector and the country\u2019s utility company. The project is, in principle, eligible for carbon cred- its under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The promoter has taken the first steps towards registering the project for the pro- gramme. Namibia: Caprivi Interconnector Project The Caprivi interconnector is a cornerstone of the SAPP initiative, identified as a priority project by the NEPAD, as it will interconnect the northern and south- ern parts of the SAPP network. The project provides Namibia with access to the hydro capacities of Zam- bia, Mozambique and other SAPP members, contrib- uting to reducing its dependence on South Africa for its electricity supply. By providing a reliable and secure electricity supply to Namibia and reinforcing electricity transmission inter- connections between SAPP partners, the project pro- motes national and regional economic development and is expected to stimulate regional energy trading and support the emergence of a competitive power market within the SAPP. The project benefits from increased cooperation between the EIB, AFD and KfW. Given the project\u2019s positive impact on the region\u2019s economy and intercon- nectivity, the South African rand (ZAR)-denominated own resources loan extended by the EIB to Namibia\u2019s state-owned electricity utility, NamPower, has also been granted an interest rate subsidy from the EU- Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund.

The Inga plant, a run-of-river installation on the Congo River, consti- tutes the backbone of the DRC\u2019s generation capacity. Due to a combination of technical, finan- cial and managerial factors, its two existing dams (Inga I and 2), built decades ago, are currently operating at just 40% of their combined capacity. Through a blend of own resources and IF funds, the Bank is extending its first sovereign loan to DRC since 1986, as part of the wider WB-led programmes (known by their acronyms SAPMP and PMEPE) to tackle the rehabilitation and expansion of Inga\u2019s existing generation capacity and the reinforcement of its transmission and distribution networks. The rehabilitation of the Inga facilities \u2013 a flagship NEPAD project \u2013 is critical for electricity sup- ply to customers in DRC, including currently un-served areas, and for export to other countries in the region.

The EIB\u2019s support for Jamaica\u2019s \u201cAirport Development Strategy\u201d and, more specifically, for the extension and modernisation of the Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA) is fully in line with the EU strategy for the island. The project is based on a well-founded Airport Expansion Plan and aims at increasing the airport\u2019s capacity to cater for the pro- jected increase of goods and passenger traffic. Improved air transport will support the competitive- ness of Jamaican business and the country\u2019s economic growth as it facilitates the development of high value export industries, business and tourism. The project will contribute to the country\u2019s progressive integration into regional and global markets. The project will not only improve traffic flow, it will also increase passenger security through greater com- pliance with security and environmental regulations. The implementation of an \u201cEnvironmental Manage- ment System\u201d to improve the airport\u2019s environmental performance supports this objective. The project, co-financed by the Caribbean Develop- ment Bank (CDB), supports the Government\u2019s efforts to improve the country\u2019s transport services and infra- structure. Alongside an IF loan, the Bank will also provide technical assistance to support private sec- tor input to the air transport sector in Jamaica, pri marily through the privatisation of NMIA. Cape Verde: Ports of Cape Verde Despite robust growth rates in recent years, Cape Verde remains vulnerable, notably due to its small and undi- versified economy, structural food deficit and depend- ence on imports, absence of natural resources and its territorial fragmentation. Port facilities, the main point of entry for merchandise into the country, are currently congested due to domestic, inter-island and interna- tional traffic increases. Their adaptation to current needs is a priority for the Government. The project aims to renovate and expand two of the country\u2019s main ports, namely Palmeira on the main island of Sal, and Praia, located near the capital city on the island of Santiago. It will generate additional berth capacity, and also include, amongst others, the construction of loading and unloading facilities and storage areas. The Bank\u2019s own resources loan will help relieve the ports\u2019 current capacity constraints and increase their competitiveness by achieving faster and more efficient handling of ships and cargoes, shorter turnaround times for ships, compliance with International Mari- time Organisation environmental and security require- ments, and lower cargo distribution costs. These improved infrastructure facilities will contribute to creating a favourable environment for the country\u2019s economic development by facilitating the growth of the housing and tourism sectors, as well as daily con- sumption on the islands. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, a subsidiary of the United States Agency for International Develop- ment (USAID), is providing a grant alongside the EIB\u2019s loan to the Cape Verdean Ministry of Finance, for on- lending to ENAPOR, the state-owned company respon- sible for the operation and management of all ports in the country.

Accord - ingly, the EIB supports projects adapted to each country\u2019s strengths, priorities and needs, be it through the diversification of the export basis or initiatives directed at national and regional markets. Ethiopia: Derba Midroc Cement Company Urban development and the need to curb the chronic housing shortage (particularly in Addis Ababa) and to develop infrastructure projects are key prior- ities for Ethiopia, but the country is highly depend- ent on imported cement with an estimated annual cement demand-supply gap of more than two mil- lion tonnes. The IF loan supports the construction and operation of a greenfield cement plant, as well as of an adjacent limestone quarry and other related infrastructure such as power lines and roads. By providing 2.1 million tonnes of cement to the domestic market, the project will reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported cement and contribute to ensuring lower cement prices. The establishment of the plant in Derba, a region with limited economic activity other than small-scale agriculture, will help to develop the Ethiopian indus- trial base and will transform a local low-value raw mate- rial into high-value cement. Once operational, the plant will employ around 475 people and a further 1 500 jobs will be created indirectly by the plant (and up to 4 000 during the construction phase). Developing local skills and infrastructure is central to this project. Employees will receive training and a EUR 200 000 social fund set up by the promoter will provide for health and educa- tion services for the surrounding communities. Alongside equity provided by the local sponsor and the IF loan, the project is co-financed by IFC, AfDB and the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE). The involve- ment of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) has impacted positively on the project, reinforcing its tech- nical, financial, social and environmental features, in line with the Equator Principles and IFC performance indicators.

Export to the European market, quota and tariff free, is likely to be further supported by the Economic Part- nership Agreement (EPA) process, which offers good prospects for local producers, including SPM. The project will expand SPM\u2019s current plantation area of 900 hectares by an extra 500 hectares, as well as contribute to improvement in the fields and factory to maximise yields and output. The land on which the expansion will take place will be leased from local vil- lage chiefs, providing substantial rental income. More than 1 000 jobs will be created in the local area, with additional benefits such as healthcare and housing allowances. The project also contributes to economic diversification and private sector enhancement in a still relatively unexploited sector. The financing package offered to this relatively new producer comprises an IF loan combined with techni- cal and financial assistance grants from the European Commission (EC) (covering 40% of the project cost), and provides long-term funding which is practically non-existent in the local market. Uganda: New Forests Company (NFC Forestry Project) A rapid increase in population and the socio-political turbulence of the 1980s resulted in indiscriminate and widespread deforestation in Uganda. Despite the continuing depletion of the country\u2019s forests at a rate of 55 000 ha per year, a solid ecological basis from which sustainable forestry can operate still exists. In a largely undeveloped agricultural sector, forestry is considered vital in Uganda\u2019s fight against poverty, as well as for meeting the high local demand for timber. The project consists of a sustainable commercial plantation of eucalyptus and pines on degraded for- est land. The EIB will partly finance New Forest Com- pany\u2019s (NFC) first plantation, located at Namwasa, 120 km northwest of Kampala, where the company intends to plant around 6 500 ha by 2011. The timber harvested will be sold mostly locally as transmission poles and round wood. In addition, a significant pro- portion of the land will be dedicated to the non-com- mercial regeneration of indigenous rain forests, in line with the Ugandan Government\u2019s policy to restore the natural environment. NFC has developed an extensive community pro- gramme, including the recruitment of relationship officers, ensuring the positive impact of the project in the surrounding areas through employment genera- tion and poverty alleviation. The programme encom- passes a small-holder plantation initiative to help increase the forest-covered area, and includes the distribution of free seedlings and training for local farmers. The project may generate carbon credits through the carbon storage from the trees. The IF loan will cover 50% of the project cost, with the remainder being brought in equity. The project will benefit from a sub- sidy from the IF to finance its community programme and has also received a USD 178 000 grant from the EC Sawlog Production Grant Scheme (SPGS) 9 . 9 The Sawlog Production Grant Scheme is a special EU fund aimed at attracting the private sector to establish commercial timber plantations in Uganda.

The Bank tailors its financial instruments to each operation to help remove restrictions on access to credit, promoting a favourable investment climate and strengthening local financial markets. In order to address specific market failures, notably the limited availability of financial services to the poor and economically marginalised, the Bank has supported an increasing number of micro- finance investment vehicles that invest in, and provide assistance to, local microfinance institu- tions throughout the ACPs. Technical assistance supports the extension of sustainable services and development of innovative products that, in turn, will generate positive social and economic impacts. In 2008, IF operations included a package of technical assistance grants to support the further development of microfinance institutions in 12 countries, focusing on financial services to small and micro-businesses. Box 7: IF support for the financial sector At the end of 2008, the Bank had signed 41 financing agreements under the IF with ACP/OCT financial sector counterparts \u2013 of which 7 in 2008 \u2013 for a total of just over EUR 522m. These agreements funded 4 065 allocations, covering 22 countries. The average amount per alloca- tion stands at EUR 38 700. In the Dominican Republic, where the Bank principally finances the microfinance sector and institutions such as the Banca de Ahorro y Credito Adopem (ADOPEM) (see box 8), the average amount allocated was slightly under EUR 1 000. Such allocations cater for the needs of a fringe of the population that would not be able to benefit from direct support from the EIB and that, through their entrepreneurship, make a significant contribution to eco- nomic growth and poverty reduction. Lines of credit allow the Bank to reach a greater number of sectors, diversifying its operations away from its traditional sectors of activity, for example by supporting undertakings in the wholesale and retail trade, agriculture, hunting and forestry, education or health and social work, accounting for respectively, 6%, 5%, 3% and 1% of allocations. Lines of credit in favour of regional banks, e.g. the CDB or Development Finance Limited (DFL) in Trinidad and Tobago are also very useful to reach out to those smaller countries where it is sometimes difficult for the Bank to operate directly, thereby supporting the regional diversification of its portfolio.

        "Annual Report 2008 40 Investment Facility \u201cEIB loans for SMEs\u201d In developing countries, a vast majority of the workforce operates in SMEs, both in the formal and informal sector. The financial sector is often not in a position to offer adequate financial interme - diation to such structures, i.e. long-term loans denominated in local or foreign currencies, thus hampering the expansion of both local and export-oriented businesses. Accordingly, the Bank strives to increase outreach to SMEs by mitigating restrictions on access to credit, supporting the emergence of a favourable investment climate and strengthening local financial markets. The Bank focuses on identifying and selecting the right intermediaries, based on their financial strength, the quality of their governance, their risk management and internal control systems, as well as their interest and willingness to lend to SMEs and small businesses. In this context, tech- nical assistance activities strengthen the capacity of financial intermediaries and help improve the implementation of global loans. Malawi: Malawi Global Loan III In recent years, the IMF has sponsored several pro- grammes in Malawi aimed at improving macroeco- nomic management, which have led to increased fiscal discipline, a reduction in inflation rates and some stabilisation in the foreign reserves position. The country also attained HIPC completion point in September 2006. Despite this, the financial sector is still not in a posi- tion to support the expansion of export-oriented businesses. This new line of credit, the first in the country under the IF, addresses this critical deficiency by extending long-term dollar (USD)-denominated funding to three of the country\u2019s main commercial banks, namely, National Bank of Malawi, First Merchant Bank of Malawi and Standard Bank Malawi. The three institutions cater for slightly different customer bases and, combined, cover the country\u2019s main sectors and regions. By supporting both local banks and export- oriented companies operating in the agriculture, agro- industry (tea and coffee), tourism and mining fields, this initiative will generate a positive impact on the coun- try\u2019s economy through local job creation and direct poverty alleviation. Zambia: Capital Investment Line GL III The Capital Investment Line is a follow-up to previous credit lines extended by the EIB under the Lom\u00e9 Con- vention 10 . Its purpose is to provide selected interme- diaries with long-term resources in foreign exchange, to improve local risk management capabilities and increase cooperation with locally owned banks. The intermediaries retained to date, namely Stan- bic Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, African Banking Corporation, Finance Bank and Investrust (with Bar- clays Bank possibly joining at a later date) will pro- vide medium to long-term loans and lease financing either in EUR or USD for private investment projects in a wide range of productive sectors of the Zambian economy. 10 This operation is the sixth EIB loan to the financial sector in Zambia since 1994. The previous loan, totalling EUR 40m, created over 7 000 jobs and con- tributed to investments of some EUR 130m. ",
        "Annual Report 2008 41 Investment Facility Box 8: The Dominican Republic For the past 12 years, the Bank has supported the development of the microfinance sector in the Dominican Republic, playing an instrumental role in the development of Banco de Ahorro y Credito Ademi (ADEMI) and ADOPEM 1 . With this objective in mind, in 2008, the EIB extended its support to two initiatives addressing the specific development needs of a wider spectrum of microfinance institutions in the country, from the smallest to the largest and regulated ones. By combining equity and lines of credit a high level of flexibility has been introduced. The DR Financing Facility project provides lines of credit in local currency, the Dominican Peso, and USD as well as equity to selected local microfinance institutions. It will contribute to extending the geographical coverage of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) to other regions of the Domini can Republic, notably Santiago and the Haitian border. The project Small Enterprises Global Loan B complements this intervention. The provision of equity capital and institutional support to ADOPEM will contribute to strengthening its posi - tion as an experienced financial intermediary and to supporting its transformation into a regu- lated financial institution. By providing local institutions with financing that would otherwise not be available on the local market, and on more flexible terms, both projects will contribute to the development and strengthening of the financial sector. Local entrepreneurs \u2013 notably in rural and poor areas \u2013 will benefit from improved long-term financing opportunities. In turn, this should stimulate the country\u2019s economic growth and contribute to poverty reduction. Best practices will be encouraged, notably regarding governance and risk management. The DR Financing Facility will benefit from a comprehensive technical assistance programme (financed by the Cotonou TA envelope). 1 Banco ADOPEM (Banco De Ahorro Y Credito Adopem), founded in 2004, is the second largest microfinance institution in the Domi- nican Republic. It finances micro-entrepreneurs and less favoured socio-economical classes. Banco ADEMI (Banco de Ahorro y Cr\u00e9dito Ademi), founded in 1997 is the largest development bank in the country.

It will also generate viable employment opportunities in the private sector. The facility will spur competition among financial inter- mediaries, which should have positive implications for the pricing of the sub-loans and easing the access to finance of neglected customer segments. Niger: PG Secteur Financier III Following the successful implementation of two previ- ous Bank credit lines to Nigerian financial intermediaries for on-lending to SMEs, the need for medium to long- term loans in local currency remains as pressing. Accordingly, a third CFAF-denominated line of credit has been extended to three Nigerian banks, namely, the Banque Internationale pour l\u2019Afrique au Niger SA (BIAN), the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nigerienne de Banque (SONIBANK) and the Bank of Africa Niger (BOAN), for on-lending to local SMEs, including micro-enterprises. The scheme will continue to benefit from the financial support of the Tanyo Group (backstopping the underlying projects) either financially, through partial guaran- tees, or via the monitoring of the borrower from the implementation of the projects to the full repayment of the loans. The previous lines of credit have proven to be a good means of supporting SME project creation, modernisa- tion or expansion in Niger. Both operations have been allocated to a total of 70 projects, including the financ- ing of schools and clinics, and have generated more than 1 000 jobs. The operation will target SMEs with high value added in the industry, agro-industry, tourism, health and edu- cation sectors. By supporting intermediary banks, the project will encourage the development of Niger\u2019s \u2013 still very under-developed \u2013 financial sector and its capability to provide competitive financial services to SMEs. Regional \u2013 OCT: OCTs Financing Facility The Caribbean countries that are signatories to the OCT Decision and beneficiaries of the related Investment Facility are spread across a wide area. Nevertheless, they share common economic and financial charac- teristics. In spite of the existence of offshore financial centres, their SMEs suffer from poor access to long- term financing. This financing facility addresses this need. Initially, the funds will be made available to the Development Bank of the Netherlands Antilles (OBNA) and the Aruban Investment Bank (AIB), located in the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba respectively. Such credit lines are an efficient way for the Bank to cover small and dispersed territories and to provide improved finance access for SMEs in the region, across a wide range of sectors, including transport and serv- ices, as well as tourism, manufacturing, industry and agriculture. Given its development mandate, OBNA covers mar- ket segments and projects which are not normally of interest to commercial institutions, notably small-scale projects for fishermen. AIB offers a wide range of inte- grated financial, economic and management services to both the private and public sector. Alongside the IF USD-denominated line of credit, the project includes a technical assistance grant to sup- port the intermediaries\u2019 efforts to deal with SMEs facing problems accessing long-term finance and to improve their risk management and compliance procedures, including best practices regarding corporate govern- ance or environmental issues. Regional \u2013 Caribbean: DFL Regional SME The financial services sector in the Southern and East- ern Caribbean has a poor track record of investment in SMEs.

Through its various subsidiaries, the group offers financing in the form of loans, equity and quasi-equity in the manufacturing, agro-industrial, tourism and renew- able energy sectors. This new IF operation with DFL Holdings will address the significant unmet demand for flexible SME financ- ing across the region. Support for local SMEs will con- tribute to employment and economic growth in some of the least-developed economies in the region.

        "Annual Report 2008 44 Investment Facility IF Equity Portfolio Over the last five years, the IF has invested in equity funds targeting small, medium or large private enterprises. The performance of the first generation of IF funds is encouraging, with a number of them showing initial returns on investments above expectations (e.g. African Lion Fund II and Emerging Markets Partnership II). In 2008, the IF continued to maintain a mix between funds addressing the lower and the upper ends of the spectrum in terms of the size of the tar- get enterprises. It endeavoured to assist successful managers in raising second or third genera- tion funds as well as to identify new managers to complement and diversify the existing pool of private equity managers with a strong ACP/OCT background. A majority of equity operations adopted a regional approach. Liberia: Access Bank Liberia The violence that characterised Liberia\u2019s political scene since the late 1980s ended in 2003 with the sign- ing of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Since taking office in 2006, President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf has implemented reforms designed to move the country towards macroeconomic stability and a credible political framework. Access to microfinance is still sparse for the entire population following two decades of turmoil. This project jumpstarts the provision of such financing by creating a new commercial bank, Access Bank Libe- ria, which aims to provide financial services to micro and small enterprises in the capital of Monrovia and other main urban centres. Technical assistance is also being provided to ensure the bank has the resources to apply best practices in microfinance. This initiative has a strong demonstration effect and outreach in a post-conflict country. The EIB\u2019s additional- ity in this project focuses on its ability to offer a funding package that includes equity, debt and technical assist- ance funds. Few other organisations are able or willing to provide this combination of resources. By creating a new institution able to sustain microfinance on com- mercial terms, and following best practices, the project has the potential to generate a substantial increase in the long-term availability of financial services for the poor. The project is the Bank\u2019s first operation in Liberia for 20 years and is the first private sector project sup- ported by any multilateral development bank for many years. The IFC and the AfDB are among the institution\u2019s primary shareholders. Regional \u2013 Africa: African Lion Mining Fund III Despite cyclical downturns in commodity markets, the demand for financing exploration and mine develop- ment remains huge and junior explorers and mining companies have difficulty financing the riskier early- stage phases of exploration and mine development. ",
        "Annual Report 2008 45 Investment Facility Following two highly successful earlier investments, the IF is supporting the third African Lion Mining Fund established to provide early-stage equity for private mining companies throughout Africa, principally tar- geting advanced exploration, feasibility and devel- opment projects. The Fund focuses on Sub-Saharan countries and is actively involved in reviewing and advising the companies in which it invests. The Fund does not limit its investments to precious, base and other metals, but also covers other mineral commodi- ties such as industrial minerals, bulks and gemstones. Financing early-stage small and medium-scale mining projects in Africa prepares the ground for subsequent mining projects which can make a significant contri- bution to economic development and job creation, Box 9: EIB support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s estimates, investments worth USD 26 trillion are required between now and 2030 to cater for the world\u2019s growing energy needs. To meet this demand, the Bank, in accordance with Article 23 f) of the Cotonou Agreement, extends its cooperation to the \u201cdevelopment of competitive industrial, mining and energy sec- tors\u201d, recognising that transparent and well-managed projects can make a significant contribu- tion to sustainable economic development and poverty alleviation in the countries where they are implemented. In 2008, the EIB endorsed the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The initiative encourages, on a voluntary basis, the disclosure and reconciliation of extractive industry pay- ments and revenues. Enhanced transparency from both governments and extractive companies contributes to increased accountability regarding the use of extractive industries proceeds. The EIB is committed to promoting good governance in all the projects that it finances. Support- ing the objectives of the EITI reconfirms the Bank\u2019s recent joint undertaking with other develop- ment financing institutions, in the form of the Approach Statement on Corporate Governance, to promote sound corporate governance, as well as the orientation of its recently revised anti- fraud and corruption policy. The EIB applies European Union standards and international best practice to all the projects it finances, devoting particular attention to development, environ- mental and social issues. The EIB supports EITI work in the resource-rich countries in which the Bank operates, by work- ing with its project sponsors to introduce greater transparency and consistency in reporting on payments at a project level. At the same time, the EIB promotes the initiative in its contacts with governments and national authorities and encourages them to adopt the EITI principles for reporting and publishing extractive industry revenues. The EIB also actively supports the work of the EITI International Secretariat based in Oslo. ",

Advancing exploration projects to the development or even production stages provides the mining industry with the new projects to meet the sustained demand for commodities on world markets. A number of co-investors are involved in this \u201csuccess story\u201d, notably Lion Selection Ltd, the promoter, the AFD\u2019s Promotion et Participation pour la Coop\u00e9ration Economique (PROPARCO), the Capital for Development (CDC) Group, Rand Merchant Bank and BIFM 11 . The Fund will only make investments in investee compa- nies with full consideration of environmental and social factors, in accordance with best international practice. For the environmental and social aspects, World Bank and IFC Performance Standards will be applied in addi- tion to local requirements. The well-experienced fund manager will ensure appropriate reporting on inves- tee companies according to a set of agreed key devel- opment performance indicators such as anti-money laundering measures, environmental, health, safety, social, EITI and Kimberley Process considerations and development impacts. Regional \u2013 West and Central Africa: Atlantic Coast Regional Fund Given the shortage of risk capital and strategic support for small and medium-sized enterprises in the West and Central Africa region, the Fund will set an important precedent for foreign investment in the local markets, raising the profile of private equity to local financiers and intermediaries. The Fund focuses on a broad range of mid-market com- panies operating businesses in need of growth and expansion capital. Companies in need of strategic and directional support are targeted, notably in the areas of technology, infrastructure, regional and pan-African initiatives, financial services and privatisation of state- owned enterprises. By supporting private sector development, the Fund will foster economic growth and employment in the region and also stimulate the emergence of a private equity culture. Ultimately, by attracting FDI to non-tra- ditional sectors of the economy, it will contribute to its diversification away from reliance on natural resources and tourism. Through this project, the Bank supports fund manag- ers with strong African ties and backgrounds that, in turn, will contribute to adding value and transferring best practice to local companies. The Bank\u2019s equity participation and that of its co-inves- tors (IFC, AfDB, CDC, the Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation Ltd (FinnFund) and private institutional investors), should have a strong demonstration effect, encouraging further investment by private capital \u2013 both local and foreign \u2013 in private equity on the con- tinent. The involvement of the EIB and other donors as founding shareholders ensures the Fund\u2019s applica- tion of best practices in terms of environmental and social compliance. Regional \u2013 Africa: Aureos Africa Fund Small and medium-sized enterprises contribute to more than 50% of economic output and employment in Africa. Lack of access to credit is one of the most per- sistent challenges that impede their growth and devel- opment. Aureos was established in 2001 to manage a portfolio of investments in small and medium-sized enterprises. As of 2003, it extended its operations to a new generation of regional private equity funds in sub-Saharan Africa. This new pan-African private equity fund will fur- ther develop the investment strategies pursued by Au reos\u2019s African regional funds since 2003, focusing particularly on building businesses with potential for regional expansion. The investment strategy involves a hands-on value- enhancing approach, including the institutional strengthening of portfolio companies. The Fund will invest in sectors such as construction, engineering and 11 BIFM, a Botswana-based insurance fund. ",
        "Annual Report 2008 47 Investment Facility Box 10: Overview of Investment Facility private equity operations in the ACPs Since the inception of the Cotonou Mandate, private equity operations carried out by the EIB through the IF have concentrated on three aims: having a business development impact, gener- ating a demonstration effect and triggering financial returns. At the end of 2008, the IF\u2019s active equity portfolio comprised: \u2022 10 direct investment operations amounting to EUR 30.24m. Seven of the operations target the financial sector while the remaining three are directed at the tourism sector. \u2022 23 indirect investment operations in funds or specialised investment vehicles totalling EUR 256m 1 . Further information on indirect investment operations: To date, indirect investments have yielded EUR 24m in returns through capital gains and divi- dends. Cumulatively, these funds have generated approximately EUR 600m of investments in the ACPs. The funds and vehicles in which the IF has invested cover a broad spectrum of sectors 1 and com- panies, ranging from very small SMEs to larger businesses. In its efforts to balance risks, the IF pro- vides capital to both new funds and 2nd and 3rd generation funds. Most of them have a strong pan-African dimension. The EIB is committed to the success of these undertakings and plays an active role in the funds\u2019 governance, notably by assuming Board positions.

The IF private equity portfolio seeks to cover as broad a spectrum of projects as possible, ranging from larger enterprises to microfinance operations. The economic growth of the ACP region, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, should, in the long run, increase the number of sectoral funds, contribute to expanding the regional focus and increase invest- ment opportunities in medium-sized operations.

The portfolio will be diversified and not limited to a particular transaction type, industry or sector and will target the lower to middle end of the spectrum in terms of size of target enterprises. A number of investors have subscribed to the Fund alongside the EIB, notably IFC, CDC and other devel- opment finance institutions (DFIs). Their involvement ensures that the Fund follows best practices with respect to environmental and social compliance by investees. Regional \u2013 Africa: Adlevo Capital Africa Despite a rapid increase in private equity flows in Africa, the majority of investments are mainly in large compa- nies in the traditional sectors of the economy. There is therefore a need to address the limited availability of risk capital for African technology companies. Adlevo Capital Africa is the first pan-African private equity fund to target the growing opportunities for investment in technology and information and com- munications technologies (ICT). The Fund will focus on investment in high-growth firms with technology business models principally, although not exclusively, in Nigeria, West Africa and South Africa where recent economic developments have increased demand, notably for ICT services. The project is expected to deliver significant enterprise development benefits, especially in the area of infor- mation technology. It has the potential to attract con- siderable levels of FDI in non-traditional sectors of the economy and to allow African businesses to gain com- petitive advantages and generate economic growth. Adlevo benefits from the experience of other co-inves- tors such as CDC, the UK Government-owned fund of funds. Its management team has international venture capital and technology experience and will operate from offices located in Lagos and Johannesburg. Benefiting from transfers of know-how from CDC, operations will be carried out according to best international practices. Regional \u2013 Africa: AfricInvest Fund This operation intends to replicate the Bank\u2019s well- proven experience with the AfricInvest I Fund 12 , which focused on the growth and expansion of SMEs in North Africa and in sub-Saharan, West and East Afri- can countries. The Fund will make equity and quasi-equity invest- ments in well-established SMEs, focusing on those sectors in need of growth capital, namely the financial sector, technology, agribusiness and manufacturing. By providing long-term capital in the form of equity to Africa\u2019s growing private sector, the Fund will support the region\u2019s economic growth and employment. At the same time, it will encourage the emergence of mod- ern African entrepreneurship and south-south coop- eration, that is to say the transfer of skills acquired in North Africa to other parts of the continent and the expansion of national markets. The Fund will act as a catalyst to attract FDI away from the traditional sectors of natural resources and tour- ism and help develop the private equity industry in the region. The IF, alongside co-investors such as IFC, FMO, FinnFund, Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Mar- kets (SIFEM), Proparco, the Belgian Investment Com- pany for Developing Countries (BIO), CDC and private institutional investors, as well as high net worth indi- viduals, will support the emergence of this \u201creference\u201d investor and ensure compliance with best practices with respect to environmental and social compli- ance. 12 The Fund is sponsored by Tuninvest, an independent North African financial services company, a close partner of the EIB, in which it has invested a total amount of approximately EUR 24.4m from FEMIP risk capital resources in the Mediterranean.

        "Annual Report 2008 50 Investment Facility Box 11: Technical assistance (TA) The EIB continued to expand and consolidate its TA programme in 2008, helping to support a range of projects and lending programmes. TA in ACPs has received funding from the Cotonou I and II frameworks, the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, and the EU-ACP Water Project Prepa- ration Facility. Most TA operations are designed to either help identify and prepare projects or to ensure their smooth implementation. TA tends to facilitate the efficient utilisation of loan finance and can contribute to generating new lending opportunities. In accordance with the strategic thrust of the Investment Facility, the 2008 TA programme focused on: \u2022 financial sector operations (microfinance and SME lending, for instance in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Liberia, Uganda and the Dominican Republic); \u2022 infrastructure undertakings, notably regional initiatives in Rwanda, Burundi, Congo and West Africa. Microfinance, fundamental to protecting and empowering the poor In January 2008, the EIB signed its first microfinance technical assistance agreement with Micro- Cred, a microfinance investment company in which it holds a 16% equity stake. The purpose of the operation is to support the development of greenfield microfinance institutions in sub-Saha- ran Africa. The TA funding provided by the EIB enabled MicroCred\u2019s subsidiaries in Madagascar and Senegal to expand the range of financial products and services offered for productive pur- poses. As part of this TA support, a pilot SME programme targeting small formal enterprises was launched in Madagascar. The pilot proved to be a great success resulting in 73 disbursed SME loans over a 10-month period amounting to EUR 688 571 with non-performing loans standing at 3% at the end of 2008. In view of these encouraging results, SME loans are becoming a stand- ard product offered by MicroCred Madagascar, catering to the needs of formal enterprises. It is planned to implement similar pilots at MicroCred Senegal, as well as at other MicroCred sub- sidiaries, in 2009. The example of MicroCred Madagascar confirms that microfinance services can be delivered in a sustainable and profitable way. However, due to their relatively small size and high up-front investment requirements, greenfield and early-stage MFIs require technical assistance in order to build capacity during the initial years of operation. The EIB works closely with a number of co-financing partners such as IFC, FMO, KfW and other agencies, as well as private foundations, when investing in microfinance investment companies and providing technical assistance.

        "Annual Report 2008 52 Investment Facility Outlook for 2009 \u201cFlexibility and responsiveness\u201d Activity in 2009 will be influenced by the impact of the food and international financial crises on the ACPs and OCTs. The negative effects of the global economic slowdown are expected to gradually trickle down, narrowing trade flows, reducing net capital inflows, affecting local currency financing and decreasing remittances. Potential cuts in public development aid raise additional concerns. In this context, the Bank will have to remain as flexible as possible so as to play a catalytic role, con- tributing to restoring confidence and to generating a counter-cyclical effect. Efforts will remain concentrated on infrastructure and financial sector development as key drivers of sustained growth and private sector expansion. Regional integration through the financing of cross-border infrastructure projects and possibly financial sector interventions of regional character will be encouraged. The Bank will encourage the identification of renewable energy projects, energy efficiency initiatives or projects involving climate change adaptation measures, and projects making use of environmentally friendly energy solutions, such as geother- mal, solar, biomass and wind power for which, in certain cases, subsidies will be required. This objective will be achieved by deploying, where possible and appropriate, alter- native and innovative financial instruments, notably the use of guarantees and local currency financing. Due to the credit crunch, the availability of equity instruments will play an increas- ingly important role in the funding of private sector investment projects, and the IF will step up its equity commitment (direct and via investment vehicles). The IF will also pursue the diversification of its investment strategies and regional coverage in order to facilitate the development of sustainable microfinance opera- tions with an emphasis on capacity building, integrated international networks and greenfield operations. Overall, the accent will continue to be put on closer cooperation with multilateral and bilateral financing partners as well as other stakeholders, notably in support of public-private initiatives. A more systematic dialogue will help to identify potential projects and incentives for leveraging private sector finance (and to reach delegated cooperation). Consolidation of the Bank\u2019s current strategy Increasing the share of renewable energy and climate change mitigation projects Responsiveness, the key to a challenging economic environment Cooperation and dialogue ",
        "Annual Report 2008 53 Investment Facility Efforts to reach out to policy-makers, civil society and NGOs will be maintained. Regu- lar and constructive dialogue is paramount to refining project choice, increasing coop- eration and generating impact. In order to optimise the allocation of fairly limited resources in keeping with the needs of the ACPs and OCTs, while at the same time being responsive to the current global crisis, a more focused implementation of ESIAF is planned in 2009. This should result in selective, early-stage project screening, more consistent monitoring of the Bank\u2019s operations and ex-post project evaluations. Such an approach should enable an ade- quate balance to be struck between increased risk-taking, the overall long-term finan- cial sustainability of the IF and achieving a development impact. The Bank will take advantage of the additional funds made available for technical assistance under Cotonou II. Result-oriented management ",

        "Annual Report 2008 55 Investment Facility The following sections present a global overview of the IF portfolio for the ACPs and OCTs. \u27be Breakdown by sector Private sector-led initiatives accounted for 77% of the cumulative signed portfolio at the end of 2008, reflect- ing the IF\u2019s central objective of fostering private sector development and economic growth. This percent- age includes both direct financing to private sector projects and indirect financing via financial intermedi- aries, through which the development of local financial markets and local SMEs is encouraged. Investment in the financial sector, including credit lines to promote local SMEs and participation in equity and venture capital funds, represents 51% of the current portfolio (EUR 1 057m), of which EUR 190m under the European Financing Partnership Agency Agreements. Cumula- tive signatures for credit lines to financial institutions stood at EUR 522m at end-2008, representing 25% of cumulative signatures under the IF. The energy sector matches this figure, accounting for 22% (EUR 447.9m) of the portfolio. The vast majority of operations are carried out in Central and Eastern Africa, as illustrated by the Inga power rehabilitation project launched in 2008. Industry \u2013 predominant in the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region \u2013 accounted for 16% (EUR 323m) of the portfolio at end-2008, and included a relatively significant proportion of mining projects, although the IF is diversifying its portfolio, reducing concentration on such operations. In 2008, only one operation targeted the mining sector (African Lion Mining Fund III), while the Bank also supported the construction and operation of a greenfield cement plant in Ethiopia. The Bank, as a member of the EITI, tar- gets countries which are committed to implementing reforms under agreed Governance Action Plans that focus on improved governance and transparency in the extractive industries (carefully assessing the mer- its of each project identified, with due regard given to environmental aspects \u2013 see box 9). Water and sewerage projects represent 3% (EUR 71m) of the overall IF portfolio, most of which are carried out in Southern African and the Indian Ocean region and in Central and Eastern Africa, bearing in mind, however, that the sector attracted a significant amount through the blending of EIB own resources subsidised loans with grants from the EU-ACP Water Facility. Transport, telecommunications, tourism, agriculture, fisheries and forestry remain secondary sectors of operation in the ACPs and OCTs. At the end of 2008, the Bank\u2019s own resources port- folio by sector presented a slightly different break- down: 39% of operations focused on industrial undertakings, 22% on energy projects, 13% on credit lines and 10% on financial services, with the Water, sewerage 3% Telecommunications 2% Transport 3% Services 28% Credit lines 25% Energy 22% Industry 16% Agriculture, fisheries, forestry 1% Cotonou Investment Facility: Cumulative signatures in the ACPs and OCTs 01/04/2003-31/12/2008 Breakdown by sector 2.

        "Annual Report 2008 60 Investment Facility This is fully in line with the IF\u2019s risk-bearing nature and focus on financial sector operations. So far, guarantee operations account for only 6% of signed commitments. The Bank is exploring ways to further develop the guarantee portfolio by promot- ing the use of guarantee products, notably to mobilise local resources and alleviate the foreign exchange risk for ACP and OCT operators, in particular those whose revenues are denominated in local currency. Loans are extended in euros, widely traded curren- cies and, where feasible, in local ACP currencies, in line with the provision of the Cotonou Agreement which enables the Bank to bear the forex risk on local currencies, notably for supporting SMEs. The IF\u2019s ability, in certain circumstances, to provide local currency financing is a major value added in meet- ing the requirements of SMEs and other companies with very little, if any, foreign exchange revenues. Local currency operations totalled the equivalent of EUR 207.5m for 23 operations in the following cur- rencies: CFA franc, Dominican peso, Fiji dollar, Kenyan shilling, Mauritanian ouguiya, Rwandese franc, South African rand and Ugandan shilling. \u27be Reflows With the implementation of the IF now well under way, reflows are progressively building up as the first repayments under earlier investments (both debt and equity) begin to take place. In line with the terms of the Cotonou Agreement and the objective of ensuring the financial sustainability of the IF, these reflows will be reinvested into new operations. At the end of 2008, accumulated reflows stood at EUR 274m, of which EUR 169m 16 for 2008 only. This figure includes two fairly large early repayments. Capital repayment of loans and interest income on ongoing projects account for the bulk of this figure. Such reflows should provide a comfortable basis on which to build up the IF portfolio at an aimed level of EUR 450m per year. However, the environment in which the IF operates and the financial crisis could impact on the level of lending. \u27be Risk profile The need to ensure the long-term financial sustain- ability of the IF implies the close monitoring of its risk profile and exposure limits. Each operation is subject to a thorough risk analysis at the time of its appraisal by the Bank\u2019s team, followed by close monitoring of project implementation in the field and regular reviews \u2013 at least annual \u2013 of the financial, economic and even technical aspects. At the end of 2008, the IF portfolio was characterised by a concentration of so-called \u201csat- isfactory\u201d and \u201cacceptable\u201d risk operations, with pre- dominance of the latter. Prudential limits related to foreign exchange and high-risk instruments (equity) were complied with, even though the impact of the financial crisis (see box 2) started to emerge, resulting in a higher than anticipated level of provisioning. Pros- pects for 2009 are a matter of concern, hence the need for greater attention and monitoring of a number of operations, notably those related to certain commodi- ties and thus mining. 16 Figure subject to change depending on the impact of swap reimbursements, yet to be confirmed.

        "Annual Report 2008 61 Investment Facility Partnerships \u201cTaking part in the global partnership for development\u201d Throughout 2008, the Bank maintained its drive to improve the quality of its operations and their impact on growth and development. Such efforts have been based on strengthened partnerships and enhanced cooperation with the European Commission and the Member States, bilateral and multilateral donors, international financial institutions and ACP/OCT stakeholders. The Bank plays an active role in the implementation of the principles of coordination and har- monisation re-stated in various forums over the year, notably in Accra and Qatar during the third level forum on Aid Effectiveness and the UN conference on financing for development. Coherence and synergies between EU development aid and the Bank\u2019s operations are achieved through different initiatives and events, including regular meet- ings on policy matters as well as country, sector or project-specific issues, including, among others: \u27be the EU-Africa Infrastructure Partnership, with which the Bank is closely associated. The Bank was instru- mental in the process that led to the setting up of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (see box 5) and gives priority to making it a success. The Fund is aimed at fostering closer collaboration between EU donors and project financiers in order to finance regional infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa; \u27be co-funding of operations through the Water Facility (WF), which enables the EIB to collaborate with other donors, NGOs and community-based organisations in financing pro-poor urban water and sanitation projects. The WF also co-finances, along with the EIB, a EUR 3m ACP Water Project Preparation Facil- ity (WPPF), a TA instrument which will support the preparation of further projects over the three-year period 2008-2010. In parallel, the Bank has been maintaining active contacts with other financing institutions (notably the World Bank and the AfDB) in order to agree upon a common strategy for the sector and to coordinate project initiatives. Cooperation with IFIs and DFIs allows for resource shar- ing with higher leveraging effects and value added. Cooperation ranges from dialogue on institutional matters to mutual consultation on horizontal topics and thematic issues and cooperation on operational lending. Cooperation includes upstream dialogue on project identification, joint appraisal or monitor- ing work and co-financing, often characterised by a very open and systematic dialogue at staff level. Since the inception of the Cotonou I mandate and the OCT Decision in 2003, out of a total of 110 projects signed (accounting for EUR 2 059m), 55 projects have been co-financed with MFIs/EDFIs, representing EUR 1 167m in terms of signatures. In addition to co-financing, the Bank is actively involved in a number of initiatives promoting closer cooperation amongst the donor community and development stakeholders , and will continue to play an active role to ensure the success of these ini- tiatives, notably: \u27be the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) hosted by the AfDB. The Bank has been involved in assist- ing project identification and coordination in Africa, notably within the framework of the EU-Africa Infra- structure Trust Fund (see above and box 5).

        "Annual Report 2008 62 Investment Facility Box 13: European Financing Partners (EFP) Coordination of national and European development policy cooperation in the ACP region EFP is a special purpose vehicle created in 2004 and jointly owned by the European develop- ment finance institutions (EDFIs) and the EIB. EFP funds commercially viable, mainly medium- sized, private sector projects in the ACP States. Financing packages in support of individual projects can range between EUR 1m and EUR 25m in size. EFP contributes up to 75% of the funds (of which two thirds are provided from the IF and one third from EDFIs), while the EDFI member submitting the project \u2013 referred to as the promoting partner \u2013 contributes the remain- ing 25%. Under the EFP structure, the EIB participates in the financing of projects that are promoted, appraised and monitored by the EDFIs. Out of EFP\u2019s existing EUR 330m total funding capacity, EUR 190m has been provided by the IF. Over the years, EFP\u2019s procedures and processes have been streamlined, contributing to acceler- ating the submission and approval of projects. At the end of 2008, EFP had committed EUR 248m in favour of 22 projects in 10 countries. In early 2009, all the funds provided by the IF envelope will have been allocated and a replenish- ment of EFP is envisaged for 2009.

        "Annual Report 2008 63 Investment Facility tion Facility (IPPF), hosted by the AfDB, have been strengthened; \u27be the Limelette process, which aims at reinforcing coordination and cooperation between the World Bank and the EC, and with which the Bank and the IFC have been associated actively since 2006; \u27be the Making Finance Work for Africa (MFW4A) part- nership (see box 3), which was established with the support of the German Presidency of the G8 and aims at promoting more effective support for financial sector development with a clear focus on upstream activities at the policy and institutional levels; \u27be the Interact/EDFI group. Cooperation with the EDFIs principally takes place under the European Financ- ing Partners (EFP) framework (see box 13), which is a good example of the general trend in the donor community to coordinate activities, cooperate and co-finance with a view to channelling develop- ment finance more efficiently to the developing world. Under EFP, the EIB participates in the financ- ing of projects that are promoted, appraised and monitored by the EDFIs, which are remunerated through an annual management fee. The experi- ence of this cooperation is positive, both in terms of the intensification of the cooperation between the EIB and the EDFIs, and in terms of the diversified portfolio of projects financed under the scheme by a number of EDFIs, which is a key objective of the EFP arrangement; \u27be the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which aims to strengthen governance by improv- ing transparency and accountability in the extrac- tive industries (see box 9). On a wider level, the Approach Statement on Corporate Governance by DFIs for equity operations supports the devel- opment and adoption by DFIs of guidelines, poli- cies or procedures to take into account corporate governance issues in due diligence and investment decisions and the promotion and use of interna- tional standards. Throughout the year, the Bank has attended and hosted events and workshops to raise awareness of the IF and the Bank\u2019s mandate in the ACPs and OCTs. The European Development Days, presentations made to the joint ACP-EC Committee of Ambassadors in July 2008, civil society\u2019s \u2013 notably, Counter Balance\u2019s \u2013 and Multilateral Development Banks\u2019 (MDBs) expert or annual meetings have provided the Bank with wel- come arenas in which to explain its work and enhance its network of partners. Dialogue with NGOs has been constructive, with the Bank taking stock of their sug- gestions, replying to inquiries and responding to criti- cisms. The Bank works to build cooperation with such entities, especially those addressing the same issues as the Bank, i.e. sustainable development, environmental protection and poverty alleviation. Such cooperation is carried out by both the Bank\u2019s Communication Depart- ment and staff involved in operations. The Bank hosted and contributed to the organisation of a number of events ranging from a seminar on regional infrastructure in Africa (in collaboration with ICA) and the European Microfinance Awards 2008 hosted by the European Microfinance Platform to the Interact annual meeting. \u201cIncreasing awareness of the IF and the Bank\u2019s activities in the ACPs/OCTs\u201d ",

Tasks cover the whole project cycle, from identification to appraisal and actual project implementation and operation. To carry out these tasks, the Department, in close coop- eration with the project promoter, relies on multidisci- plinary teams, drawing on resources from other Bank departments, namely engineers, economists and risk analysts.

        "Annual Report 2008 66 Investment Facility EIB External Regional Offices in the ACP countries The Luxembourg-based resources are complemented in the field by five External Regional Offices in Dakar, Fort-de-France, Nairobi, Sydney and Tshwane (Preto- ria), covering respectively West Africa and Sahel, the Caribbean region, Central and East Africa, the Pacific and Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean. At the end of 2008, 10 EIB staff, supported by 17 locally hired con- tract staff were assigned to the five External Regional Offices. The presence of staff locally is instrumental in rais- ing the development profile of the Bank. Through its Regional Offices, the Bank can more readily visit projects regularly and facilitate communica- tion and cooperation/coordination with project pro- moters, donors in the region, national authorities, European Commission delegations and civil society. Swift reaction at short notice to local needs as they arise contributes to improving the portfolio, often pre-empting problems and mitigating risks. By channelling local and regional information to head- quarters and promoting enduring close liaisons with operational divisions in Luxembourg, the Regional Offices are essential for identifying project opportunities and adding value at the project development stage. Following up on the activities initiated in 2007, the Dakar Office was instrumental in finalising the appraisal and signature of two projects in the water and sanita- tion sectors. Regular contacts with local authorities and close interaction with promoters resulted in the signature of a drinking water supply project in Ouaga- dougou, Burkina Faso, and of an industrial sewerage project in the Bay of Hann, Senegal. The Fort-de-France Regional Office has been active throughout the year at various conferences, work- shops and donor meetings as well as through regular contact with local delegations of the European Com- mission and other multilateral and bilateral agencies in the region. Direct intervention of the Regional Rep- resentation has been particularly useful in advancing projects in the operational pipeline: in Jamaica, a glo- bal loan for renewable energy; in Dominica, geother- mal exploration in cooperation with AFD and in Belize, the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 especially in the citrus and sugar sectors. In 2008, the Nairobi Office\u2019s contributions to the project pipeline included upstream preparatory work relating to the Kenyan and sub-regional energy, trans- port and financial sectors. Throughout the year, the office continued to provide supervisory support to the division\u2019s ongoing projects (including some financed under the former Lom\u00e9 conventions), amongst which the DAWASA project in Tanzania, the ASECNA project in Gabon, the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project and global loans in Rwanda. As regards the Bank\u2019s equity investments in East Africa, the Nairobi Office was instru- mental in monitoring and representing the Bank for the Aureos East Africa Fund, the Business Partners (Kenya) Fund and the Fedha (Tanzania) Fund. During its first full year of operation, the Sydney Office has contributed to increasing the Bank\u2019s visibility in the Pacific, notably by attending and making presentations at various conferences and regional meetings. This has generated a steady rise in the number of visitors and requests for assistance. In addition, the existence of the Regional Office has led to increased cooperation with donors, in particular the Sydney-based multilateral institutions, allowing the identification of a number of infrastructure projects, in particular in the renew- able energy sector, in both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Close contacts between the Pacific Regional Office and local financial institutions in the Pacific Islands has further increased lending and tech- nical assistance activities with these institutions and their respective associations. The Tshwane (Pretoria) Regional Office has had a marked influence on operations in Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean, whether through meeting directly ",
        "Annual Report 2008 67 Investment Facility with individual clients, or the increased visibility from networking with multi-and bilateral institutions, gov- ernments and agencies, banks, and regional organi- sations (e.g. SADC \u2013 Southern African Development Community, COMESA \u2013 Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) that are increasingly involved in supporting investment, especially infrastructure. South Africa is in many respects the economic \u201cloco- motive\u201d for the region. The location of the office in Tshwane (seat of government, but also close to Johan- nesburg, the continent\u2019s largest business and confer- ence centre) has proven to be a fortunate choice. The office also works with a very active programme under the separate mandate for financing in South Africa. Amongst the highlights of 2008 were presentations with the World Bank on infrastructure financing facili- ties to ministers, government officials and business people from Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia; par- ticipation in government-sponsored investment con- ferences in Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Zambia; contributions to SADC Energy and Invest- ment Corridors conferences. The opportunity has also been taken to underline the Bank\u2019s priority focus on energy and climate change, with participation in vari- ous events dealing with co-generation, carbon mar- kets, and renewable energy. The office represented the Bank at an EC-sponsored high-level gathering of all the COMESA states on regional economic integra- tion. Good cooperation with the Malawi and Mozam- bique EC delegations is helping to advance activity in regional transport and in Lesotho and Malawi in water sector development. It is notable that three projects signed in South Africa originated locally; moreover, the Malawi Global Loan III signed in 2008 was appraised mainly from Pretoria.

Conse- quently, the IF reported a net loss of EUR 26m, com- pared to a EUR 36m profit in the previous year. Total assets of EUR 1 145.0m comprised EUR 776.6m of outstanding loans and equity investments, up by 14% compared to 2007, 53% of which consisted of US-dollar denominated investments. The increase in outstand- ing commitments was largely financed by reflows from previous operations. Despite the loss reported in 2008, retained earnings remained at a comfortable level of EUR 51.0m, equivalent to 6% of total equity, which consists mainly of the contributions received from the Member States, EUR 845m at the end of 2008, equiva- lent to 27% of the total IF capital endowment. Following entry into force of the second financial pro- tocol of the Cotonou Agreement on 1 July 2008, and taking into account the appraisal or other fees charged by the IF for specific projects, only half of the costs incurred by the Bank for managing the IF were cov- ered by the Member States, i.e. EUR 17.8m. The bal- ance was borne by the IF. The full IF financial statements as well as related notes are presented in Annex 5. The global financial turmoil and falling commodity prices started affecting a number of IF- financed projects towards the end of 2008, notably in the countries of the Southern African region, the economies of which are more exposed.

        "Annual Report 2008 84 Investment Facility 1. General information The Investment Facility (the \u201cFacility\u201d) has been established within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement (the \u201cAgree- ment\u201d) on co-operation and development assistance negoti- ated between the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (the \u201cACP States\u201d) and the European Union and its Member States on 23 June 2000 and revised on 25 June 2005. Financing under the Agreement is provided from EU Member States\u2019 budgets and is disbursed according to financial pro- tocols defined for successive five- to six-year periods. Within the framework of the Agreement and following the entry into force of a second financial protocol on 1st July 2008 (covering the period 2008-2013), referred to as the 10th Eu- ropean Development Fund (EDF), the European Investment Bank (the \u201cEIB\u201d or \u201cthe Bank\u201d) is entrusted with the manage- ment of: the ACP Investment Facility (IF), a EUR 3 137 m risk-bear- \u2022 ing revolving fund geared to fostering private sector in- vestment in ACP countries; grants for the financing of interest rate subsidies worth \u2022 EUR 400 m, of which up to EUR 40 m can be used to fund project-related technical assistance. In view of the phas- ing out of the EU-ACP sugar protocol, up to EUR 100 m can be allocated to assist ACP sugar producers in adapt- ing to changing world market conditions. 2. Significant accounting policies 2.1. Basis of preparation In line with the Investment Facility Management Agreement the preparation of the financial statements of the Facility is guided by International Public Sector Accounting Standards or International Financial Reporting Standards, as appropriate. The Facility\u2019s financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the following significant accounting principles: 2.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires manage- ment to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Investment Facility\u2019s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed. The most significant use of judgments and estimates are as follows: Fair value of financial instruments Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabili- ties recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valu- ation techniques that include the use of mathematical mod- els. The input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a de- gree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as correlation and volatility for longer dated de- rivatives. Impairment losses on loans and receivables The Investment Facility reviews its problem loans and re- ceivables at each reporting date to assess whether an allow- ance for impairment should be recorded in the income statement. In particular, judgment by management is re- quired in the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining the level of allowance required. Such estimates are based on assumptions about a number of factors and actual results may differ, resulting in future changes to the allowance. In addition to specific allowance against individually significant loans and receivables, the Investment Facility also makes a collective impairment allow- ance against exposures which, although not specifically iden- tified as requiring a specific allowance, have a greater risk of default than when originally granted. This collective allowance is based on any deterioration in the internal rating of the loan or investment since it was granted or acquired. These internal ratings take into consideration factors such as any deterioration in country risk, industry, and technological obsolescence, as well as identified structural weaknesses or deterioration in cash flows. In principle, a loan is considered as non performing when payment of interest and principal are past due by 90 days or more and, at the same time, management considers that payment will be completely unlikely. Valuation of unquoted available-for-sale equity investments Valuation of unquoted available-for-sale equity investments is normally based on one of the following: recent arms length market transactions; \u2022 current fair value of another instrument that is substan- \u2022 tially the same; the expected cash flows discounted at current rates ap- \u2022 plicable for items with similar terms and risk characteris- tics; or other valuation models. \u2022 The determination of the cash flows and discount factors for unquoted available-for-sale equity investments requires sig- nificant estimation. The Investment Facility calibrates the valuation techniques periodically and tests them for validity using either price from observable current market transac- Notes to the financial statements ",
        "Annual Report 2008 85 Investment Facility tions in the same instrument or from other available observ- able market data. Impairment of available-for-sale financial investments The Investment Facility treats available-for-sale equity invest- ments as impaired when there has been a significant or pro- longed decline in the fair value below its cost or where other objective evidence of impairment exists. The determination of what is \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cprolonged\u201d requires judgment. The Facility treats \u201csignificant\u201d generally as 30% or more and \u201cpro- longed\u201d greater than 12 months. In addition, the Facility evaluates other factors, including normal volatility in share price for quoted equities and the future cash flows and the discount factors for unquoted equities. 2.3. Change in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those used in the previous financial years. 2.4. Summary of significant accounting policies The balance sheet represents assets and liabilities in decreas- ing order of liquidity and does not distinguish between cur- rent and non-current items. 2.4.1. Foreign currency translation The Investment Facility uses the Euro (EUR) for presenting its financial statements, which is also the functional and pres- entational currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than in Euro are translated into Euro at the exchange rate pre- vailing at the balance sheet date. The gain or loss arising from such translation is recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are trans- lated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of transactions at rates different from those at the date of the transaction, and unrealized foreign exchange differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are either recognized in the income statement or within the equity reserve. The elements of the income statement are translated into Euro on the basis of the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each month. 2.4.2. Cash and cash equivalents The Investment Facility defines cash equivalents as current accounts or short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 2.4.3. Financial assets other than derivatives Financial assets are accounted for using the settlement date basis. Loans Loans originated by the Investment Facility are recognized in the assets of the Investment Facility when cash is advanced to borrowers. They are initially recorded at cost (net dis- bursed amounts), which is the fair value of the cash given to originate the loan, including any transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effec- tive yield method, less any provision for impairment or uncol- lectability. Available-for-sale financial investments Available-for-sale financial investments are those which are designated as such or do not qualify to be classified as des- ignated at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity or loans and receivables. They include equity instruments, investments in venture capital funds and other debt instru- ments. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial invest- ments are subsequently carried at fair value. Note the follow- ing details for the fair value measurement of equity investments, which can not be derived from active markets: a. Venture capital funds The fair value of each venture capital fund will be based on the latest available Net Asset Value (NAV), reported by the fund, if calculated based on international valuation stand- ards. The Investment Facility may however decide to adjust the NAV reported by the fund if there are issues that may affect the valuation. If no internationally recognized fair valuation standard is ap- plied, the valuation will be conducted on the basis of the underlying portfolio. b. Direct equity investments The fair value of the investment will be based on the latest set of financial statements available, re-using, if applicable, the same model as the one used at the acquisition of the participation. Unrealized gains or losses on equity investments are report- ed in equity until such investments are sold, collected or disposed of, or until such investment are determined to be impaired. If an available-for-sale investment is determined to be impaired, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss previ- ously recognized in equity is included in the income state- ment. For unquoted investment, the fair value is determined by applying recognized valuation technique. These investments are accounted for at cost when the fair value cannot be reli- ably measured. Guarantees Financial guarantees are initially recognized at fair value in the balance sheet under item \u201cFinancial guarantees\u201d. Subse- quent to initial recognition, the Investment Facility\u2019s liabilities under each guarantee are measured at the higher of the am- ortized premium and the best estimate of expenditure re- quired to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee. ",
        "Annual Report 2008 86 Investment Facility Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the income statement under item \u201cImpairment charge for credit loss\u201d. The premium received is recognized in the income statement under item \u201cNet fee and commis- sion income\u201d using the effective interest rate method over the life of the guarantee. 2.4.4. Impairment of financial assets The Investment Facility assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evi- dence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an in- curred \u201closs event\u201d) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or prin- cipal payments, the probability that they will enter bank- ruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. For the loans outstanding at the end of the financial year and carried at amortized cost, impairments are made when pre- senting objective evidence of risks of non recovery of all or part of their amounts according to the original contractual terms or the equivalent value. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured according to internal models used by the Bank to approximate the likely loss or the loan recovery, which among other things evaluate the difference between the loans\u2019 carrying amounts and the fair value of estimated futures cash flows of theses loans. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income state- ment. Interest income continues to be accrued on the re- duced carrying amount based on the effective interest rate of the asset. Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the esti- mated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or re- duced by adjusting the allowance account. For the available-for-sale financial investments, the Invest- ment Facility assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that an investment is impaired. Objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its costs. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss (measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognized in the income statement) is removed from equity and recognized in the income state- ment. Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial in- vestments are not reversed through the income statement; increases in their fair value after impairment are recognized directly in equity. For held-to-maturity investments the Investment Facility as- sesses individually whether there is objective evidence for impairment. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The car- rying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. If, in a subse- quent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss decreases because of an event occurring after the impair- ment was recognised, any amount formerly charged are credited to the \u201cNet result on financial operations\u201d. The European Investment Bank\u2019s Risk Management reviews financial assets for impairment at least once a year. Resulting adjustments include the unwinding of the discount in the income statement over the life of the asset, and any adjust- ments required in respect of a reassessment of the initial impairment. 2.4.5. Derivative financial instruments Derivatives include cross currency swaps, cross currency in- terest rate swaps, currency forwards and warrants. In the normal course of its activity, the Investment Facility may enter into swap contracts with a view to hedge specific lending operations or into currency forward contract with a view to hedge it currency positions, denominated in active- ly traded currencies other than in Euro, in order to offset any gain or loss caused by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the Investment Facility has not entered into any hedge accounting transactions as at 31 December 2008. Therefore, all derivatives are measured at fair value through the income statement. Fair values are derived primarily from discounted cash-flow models, option-pricing models and from third party quotes. Warrants have been received by the Investment Facility as ancillary fees in the context of a lending operation. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial in- struments are included in \u201cNet result on financial operations\u201d. 2.4.6. Contributions Contributions from Member States are recognized as receiv- able in the balance sheet on the date of the Council Decision fixing the financial contribution to be paid by the Member States to the Investment Facility. 2.4.7. Interest income on loans Interest on loans originated by the Investment Facility is re- corded in the income statement (\u201cInterest and similar in- come\u201d) and on the balance sheet (\u201cLoan and receivables\u201d) on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the loan to the net carrying amount of the loan. Once the recorded value of a loan has been reduced due to impairment, interest income continues to be recognized using the original effective inter- est rate applied to the new carrying amount. ",

The part of the Member States contributions allocated to the payment of interest subsidies is not accounted for in the In- vestment Facility\u00eds equity but is classified as an amount owed to third parties. 2.4.9. Interest income on treasury Under the terms of the Investment Facility and according to the Financial Regulation applicable to the 9th European De- velopment Fund, the funds received by the EIB on behalf of the Investment Facility are recorded in an account in the Commission\u2019s name. Interest on these deposits, placed by the Investment Facility with the EIB, is not accounted for by the Investment Facility as it is payable directly to the Euro- pean Commission. Reflows, being repayment of principal, interest or commis- sions stemming from financial operations, and interest cal- culated on these reflows are accounted for within the Investment Facility. 2.4.10. Fees, commissions and dividends Fees received in respect of services provided over a period of time are recognized as income as the services are pro- vided. Commitment fees are deferred and recognized in in- come using the effective interest method over the period from disbursement to repayment of the related loan. Dividends relating to available-for-sale equity investments are recognized when received. 2.4.11. Taxation The Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Euro- pean Communities, appended to the Treaty of 8 April 1965 establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities, stipulates that the assets, revenues and other property of the Institutions of the Union are ex- empt from all direct taxes. 2.4.12. Reclassification of prior years figures Where necessary, certain prior years figures have been reclas- sified to conform to changes to the current year\u2019s presenta- tion for comparative purpose. 3.

        "Annual Report 2008 97 Investment Facility Independent Auditor\u2019s Report We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Investment Facility, which show a loss of EUR 26,309,000 and a total balance sheet of EUR 1,144,922,000 and which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2008, the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, the cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. Management Committee\u2019s responsibility for the finan- cial statements The Management Committee of the European Investment Bank is responsible for the preparation and fair presenta- tion of these financial statements in accordance with the measurement and recognition principles as described in Note 2 of the accompanying financial statements. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or er- ror; selecting and applying appropriate accounting poli- cies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Responsibility of the \u201cR\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises\u201d Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these finan- cial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Au- diting as adopted by the Luxembourg \u201cInstitut des R\u00e9vi- seurs d\u2019Entreprises\u201d. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstate- ment. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the finan- cial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgment of the \u201cR\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises\u201d, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the \u201cR\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises\u201d considers internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the en- tity\u2019s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of ac- counting estimates made by the Management Commit- tee, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Investment Facil- ity as of 31 December 2008, of its financial performance, of its changes in equity and of its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the measurement and recognition principles as described in Note 2 of the ac- companying financial statements.
