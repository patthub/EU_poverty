Its preparation has involved a process of consultation with members of a Working Group in Brussels comprised of representatives from Directorate E, all Geographical Directorates, the Unit in charge of central management of thematic budget lines and the Unit in charge of Evaluation and of the Results Oriented Monitoring System (ROM). The document has also benefited from the input of some 68 Delegations who responded to a web-based survey regarding their concerns and priorities on project monitoring (see Attachment 2 for a summary of survey results). Project monitoring is a challenging area of work which impacts on many of the aid effectiveness principles, including ownership, alignment, donor harmonisation and managing for results. This document intends to be just one input to support ongoing improvement in this area with a view to foster the overall quality of EC external assistance.

It supports informed and timely decision making by project managers and other stakeholders, ongoing learning and accountability for achieving results. It is a key part of project cycle management. While the general purpose of monitoring may be clear, there is a need to consider how projects are monitored in the context of the aid effectiveness agenda. This is required to ensure that the principles of partner ownership, alignment with local systems, donor harmonisation, and mutual accountability for development results are appropriately supported in both the design and implementation of project monitoring systems. In the Paris Declaration donors committed to \u201cwork with partner countries to rely, as far as possible, on partner countries resulted oriented reporting and monitoring frameworks\u201d (section 45).( 1 ) EuropeAid has established project monitoring and evaluation processes that support: (i) quality assurance prior to financing; (ii) financial control; (iii) monitoring of results during implementation; (iv) the evaluation of policies and programmes. However, key points to note about these systems include: (cid:2) They have been designed primarily to meet EuropeAid\u2019s management information needs and accountability requirements. In order to support the principles of aid effectiveness there is a need to give a greater focus to building the capacity of \u2018project internal\u2019 monitoring systems (monitoring by implementing partners ). (cid:2) The quality of information collected through the Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM) system, project evaluations and audits (and reported through the CRIS implementation report and External Assistance Management Reports), is significantly dependent on the quality of each project\u2019s internal monitoring systems; and (cid:2) These elements of the quality assurance and monitoring system must be complemented by approaches and methods which focus more on relationship building, partnership approaches and enhancing political dialogue with the aim of promoting mutual accountability for development results. 1.2 Scope and Purpose of this Document The overall goal of this Reference Document is to contribute to ongoing improvements in the quality of EC funded projects in line with the aid effectiveness principles of partner ownership, alignment, harmonisation and mutual accountability for results. With respect to project monitoring, this implies giving greater focus to supporting national implementing partners to undertake better quality monitoring, and emphasising mutual accountability for results achieved. There are two inter-related purposes of this document: (cid:129) to support effective internal project monitoring and thus promote ownership and alignment objectives; (cid:129) to support effective project monitoring( 2 ) at the level of each EC Delegation. Task Managers play two main monitoring \u2018roles\u2019, namely: (i) assessing the quality of project internal monitoring systems and, where required, planing/implementing support to improve them; and (ii) collecting relevant information and using it to meet the EC\u2019s own reporting requirements. These roles are different but closely inter-related. At the heading of each Section of the Reference Document, it is stated how the contents relate to either one or both of these two roles. 1. Introduction ( 1 ) Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, March 2005. ( 2 ) As in the glossary, \u2018Internal project monitoring/project internal monitoring\u2019 refers to monitoring undertaken by the project\u2019s implementing partners (those with direct management responsibilities). This document deals with two types of monitoring (see glossary section 1.4): (cid:129) internal project monitoring by implementing partners: aimed at effective and timely decision making by the project itself and at ensuring accountability for resource use and achievement of results; (cid:129) monitoring of projects at the level of each delegation: this has several objectives including taking informed decisions at key steps in the project cycle, contract management, and providing informed and useful reporting on project portfolios. EC Task Managers are also expected to be an informed dialogue partner, where necessary providing capacity building advice and support to implementing partners. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 5 ",
        "This Document therefore intends to help EC Task Managers: (cid:129) contribute to the effective implementation of projects and the delivery of sustainable benefits in partnership with implementing agencies; (cid:129) be an informed dialogue partner; (cid:129) make informed decisions with respect to project management; and (cid:129) contribute to the effective organisation of monitoring activities at the level of each delegation/unit and be better equipped to undertake effective and useful reporting on project performance. Based on an assessment of working practices within the donor community( 3 ), this Document provides a set of good practices and lessons learned, and selected analytical and working tools. It does not prescribe specific EuropeAid administrative or procedural requirements. It is designed to support self-directed reflection, learning and action by EC Task Managers. The focus of this Document is on the project approach. Monitoring of Sector Policy Support Programs (SPSP) and General Budget Support (GBS) operations is not specifically covered, as the monitoring of these methods of aid delivery generally require different approaches focused primarily on the development and use of national performance assessment frameworks( 4 ). This Document is targeted primarily at EC Task Managers. Counterparts and project staff may nevertheless also find it of use to develop their own capacities in this area. Finally, this Document has also been designed as a resource to support the design and delivery of training seminars as part of the EC\u2019s ongoing commitment to the professional development of its staff. 1.3 Summary of key issues addressed in this document Brief description Task Managers need to be clear about what they need to do to support effective project monitor- ing, when and how. Their role needs to be consistent with promoting key aid effectiveness princi- ples. They need to be able to play the role of \u2018informed partners\u2019 concerned with results, directly engaging with implementing partners in a strategic way. They also need to have a clear mandate to carry out this type of working approach, and the resources and skills to do this effectively. Project monitoring cannot take place in a vacuum. It requires a clear project plan against which efficiency and effectiveness issues can then be judged as implementation proceeds. A first step in the project inception phase is therefore for Task Managers to help check/complete/update the project design (the project plan should include clear and realistic objectives, useful indicators and work plans). Secondly, Task Managers should assess the project monitoring arrangements and the implementing agency/stakeholder capacity to conduct regular monitoring, and consider what additional capacity building support may be required. The Task Manager needs to access information from a variety of sources to support his/her under- standing of what is happening on the ground with respect to project performance and issues arising. The primary focus should be on getting good quality information from the project implementing agency(s) and helping to build their capacity to effectively monitor. However, information from inter- nal project monitoring should be supplemented by information from other sources such as ROM reports, field visits undertaken by the Task Manager him/herself, specially commissioned surveys/studies, and/or other donor reports. Data/information must be appropriately analysed, triangulated with other information whenever possible, and then presented in a timely manner and in an accessible media/format if it is to be useful. Supporting the analysis of project monitoring data is an important role the EC Task Manager can play. Sharing information effectively with stakeholders, including other donors, is critical. If monitoring is undertaken solely as an \u2018extractive\u2019 process which feeds information upwards, but with no timely feedback, it soon becomes seen as a bureaucratic burden rather than a useful management activ- ity. The EC Task Manager has an important role to play in ensuring that information on project progress is effectively shared, including through participation in regular internal review activities (such as Project Steering Committee meetings/activities). ( 3 ) In preparing this Reference Document, research was undertaken on donor practices in the area of project monitoring and as a result a Working Document has been produced on \u2018Screening of monitoring practices for selected donors; reference materials and further reading on project monitoring\u2019 available at http://www.cc.cec/dgintranet/europeaid/activities/adm/ documents/monitoring_practices_for_selected_donors_en.pdf ( 4 ) See relevant sections in the \u2018Guidelines on EC support to Sector Programmes\u2019 and the \u2018Guidelines on Programming, Design and Management of general Budget Support\u2019 Ch 2.

        "1.4 Glossary of key terms Terms related to monitoring Project Monitoring \u2013 refers generally to the ongoing collection, analysis and use of information about project progress and the results being achieved. It supports effective and timely management decision making, learning by project stakeholders and accountability for results and the resources used. Internal project monitoring/project internal monitoring \u2013 refers specifically to monitoring that is undertaken by the project\u2019s implementing partners, using their own (local) systems and procedures, to meet their own ongoing management information needs. Monitoring by EC Task Managers \u2013 refers to the role of EC Task Managers with respect to collecting, analysing and using information about project progress and performance, whether it is sourced from \u2018internal\u2019 or \u2018external\u2019, formal or informal sources. External monitoring (including ROM) \u2013 is distinguished from \u2018internal monitoring\u2019 because it involves external agents (e.g. donor officials or contracted consultants), and the use of donor designed/approved monitoring methods and reporting formats, which are designed primarily to meet the donor\u2019s own upward reporting and accountability requirements. The Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM) system is a key example of an \u2018external monitoring\u2019 and reporting requirement. Regular review \u2013 refers to a structured process of review, reflection and decision making, that is undertaken by the project implementing partner and other stakeholders on a regular basis. It is therefore an element of the broader monitoring process which gives particular focus to sharing information among stakeholders, and to making decisions about follow-up actions required. Project Steering Committees (or similar) might often be one of the key forums in which such regular reviews are undertaken. Other terms Implementing partners \u2013 refers to the organisations which have direct responsibility and authority for project implementation, including management of the available resources, implementation of activities and achievement or results. A project may have one or more implementing partner, and such partners may include government agencies, non-government organisations and/or private contractors. Project cycle management \u2013 is a methodology for the identification, preparation implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects and programmes. PCM methodology is based on the principles of the Logical Framework Approach. It helps specify key tasks, quality assessment criteria, roles and responsibilities and decision making options to support effective management, the achievement of desired results and learning from experience. Project Evaluation \u2013 refers to the periodic assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and relevance of a project in the context of stated objectives. It is frequently undertaken at or after completion and usually involves independent evaluators with a primarily purpose of learning lessons to guide future decision-making, design and implementation of other projects, future programming and policy making. Results \u2013 This term is used generally to refer to the outputs, outcome and/or impact of a project (as distinguished from the inputs and activities). This is different from the way the term is used in the EC\u2019s PCM Guidelines on the Logical Framework \u2013 where \u2018results\u2019 refers specifically to one level of the Logframe Matrix hierarchy of objectives \u2013 namely just the outputs. Task Manager \u2013 refers to an EC officer who has an operational responsibility for overseeing and supporting the effective formulation, implementation and/or monitoring of specific development projects or programmes financed by the EU. Most Task Managers are now based at Delegations and usually have responsibility for a broad (and often diverse) portfolio of \u2018activities\u2019. Support for effective monitoring requires that time and resources be allocated to the task(s). These resources must be explicitly accounted for in agency (Delegation/EuropeAid) work plans and budgets (including the Programme Estimates prepared under the European Development Fund/General Budget of the European Communities). This could be greatly assisted by the development and use of a \u2018Project Screening Table\u2019 and of a \u2018Project Portfolio Monitoring Plan\u2019. This would help ensure that higher risk projects are identified and that monitoring tasks (and relevant capacity development initiatives) are then prioritised and explicitly considered in work planning processes.

        "2.1 Issues Working in a large multi-lateral development agency, such as EuropeAid and the EC Delegations, is a complex, challenging, rewarding, but sometimes frustrating, task. Administrative and procedural requirements can constrain the flexibility and innovation that effective development work demands. Complex and multiple objectives can make it difficult to prioritise and focus work effort. Responsibilities and accountability for achieving results are typically blurred between donors and their local implementing partners. As a result, knowing who should be monitoring what, when and how can be difficult to determine. Addressing these broad challenges requires changes in the way that development aid is planned, managed, monitored and evaluated by the international community. Some of these required changes have already been identified, are articulated in the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness, and are further specified in donor agency commitments and action plans. These changes in turn mean that the roles, responsibilities and work focus of EC Task Managers need to be reviewed. The aim is to see how the Task Manager can play a more strategic role as a \u2018dialogue partner\u2019, rather than just as a contract manager and project \u2018controller\u2019. 2.2 The focus of the EC Task Manager\u2019s work A Task Manager\u2019s role in supporting project implementation and monitoring generally includes the following: (cid:129) Assess the quality of internal project monitoring arrangements and identify capacity building needs. (cid:129) Meet with implementing partners and other project stakeholders (including other donors), and undertake \u2018field-visits\u2019 to project sites, to get first hand knowledge of project activities and issues and to develop effective working relationships with those implementing the project. (cid:129) Assess the content and quality of monitoring reports from implementing partners and suggest corrective measures, as required, to support efficient and effective implementation. (cid:129) Collaborate with Results Oriented Monitoring teams and follow up, as appropriate, on their recommendations. (cid:129) Contribute, as appropriate, to regular reviews of project progress and updating of operational plans through regular contact with project implementers and other donors. (cid:129) Keep appropriate records of project progress, the results achieved and constraints encountered. (cid:129) Prepare, manage and control contractual documents, and prepare forecasts on contract payments. (cid:129) Support timely disbursement of EC resources, based on approved work plans and budgets and an assessment of project performance. (cid:129) Facilitate communication and information flow between, and feedback to, key stakeholders and support donor coordination and harmonisation. (cid:129) Participate in and/or manage formal reviews (i.e. mid-term evaluation) and audits commissioned by the EC or other donors. (cid:129) Request audits as required and/or considered appropriate, and provide relevant project information to audit Task Managers and auditors. (cid:129) Make timely decisions to help solve any problems and support project implementation. (cid:129) Comply with relevant instructions from EuropeAid Management on project monitoring. Currently this involves keeping information in the CRIS Implementation Report (or any equivalent format) regularly updated and making the best use of the CRIS Report as a management tool.

EC Task Manager\u2019s role in project monitoring This section provides: (cid:129) a brief overview of the Task Manager\u2019s role in project monitoring; and (cid:129) a proposed process and set of questions that could be used to guide a review of the Task Manager\u2019s input to project monitoring. This aims to support the identification of management decisions and actions that will help the Task Manager play an enhanced role as dialogue partner and thereby promote ownership and alignment objectives. It also directly supports effective organisation of monitoring activities at the level of each delegation/unit. 8 europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 8 ",
        "R e f e r e n c e D o c u m e n t \u2013 S t r e n g t h e n i n g P r o j e c t I n t e r n a l M o n i t o r i n g 9 2.3 Reviewing Task Manager roles It is a broadly recognised concern that Task Managers spend much of their time dealing with EC procedural requirements, leaving little scope for playing the role of \u2018informed dialogue partner\u2019. It is therefore suggested that Delegations might usefully conduct a brief internal review of Task Manager roles in order to identify how this situation might be addressed. Such a review might best be initiated at the level of each Delegation, or in the case of centrally managed programmes, within the concerned Unit/Directorate in Brussels. The Delegation or Unit/Directorate Head should endorse and support the review initiative before it starts. The review would be best conducted as a collective and participatory exercise involving all Task Managers, however it could be undertaken on a more selective basis (e.g. involving specific sectors or sections). Steps in the process might include: A set of Guiding Questions for Task Managers to consider and respond to is provided on the following page. Guiding Questions 1. What proportion of your working time is devoted to activities related to project monitoring and fulfilling reporting requirements (such as completing/updating CRIS reports, supporting ROM exercises, etc\u2026)? 2. Do you distinguish between monitoring activities which are designed primarily to meet your own/the Commission\u2019s information needs, and monitoring support activities designed primarily to help build/develop partner capacities to effectively monitor? 3. Roughly what proportion of your working time do you allocate to supporting implementing partners to monitor their projects more effectively (\u2018value adding activities\u2019)? This might include analysis of partner agency monitoring systems and capacity, provision of ideas and advice on strengthening these systems, feedback on their monitoring reports, organising and/or participating in project monitoring workshops, etc. 4. On balance, and given other work priorities, is this adequate? 5. Do you have/use a definable process which helps you prioritise and plan your project monitoring work, including allocation of time and resources to different projects? 6. In light of the EC\u2019s commitments to increase aid effectiveness, what changes in your monitoring responsibilities and work practices do you think might be required to promote: increased ownership by implementing partners? alignment with partner systems? harmonisation with other donors? And, mutual accountability for development results? 7. If changes are required, what management decisions need to be made, and/or directives given, to facilitate and support such changes? 8. What are the resource implications (time, workload, funds, other inputs)? 9. Are there likely to be any specific skill development/training needs you will require to effectively take on identified new roles responsibilities and work practices? If so \u2013 what might they be? Without wishing to pre-empt conclusions drawn by any such reviews undertaken by Delegations/Units, one thing seems clear. If the Task Manager is to play an enhanced role as dialogue partner, more time needs to be spent having direct contact with implementing partners, and more focus needs to be given to discussing substantive issues that impact on project effectiveness (rather than just on input delivery and expenditure). 1. Prepare brief proposal to conduct such a review, for endorsement by Delegation/Directorate/Unit Head. 2. Identify Task Managers who should/could be involved in the review process. 3. Organise a preliminary meeting to discuss and clarify the review\u2019s purpose and process. The primary purpose should be to identify possible changes in the roles and responsibilities of Task Managers with respect to project monitoring that will support specific aid effectiveness commitments, namely: (i) increased ownership by implementing partners; (ii) alignment with partner systems; (iii) harmonisation with other donors; and (iv) mutual accountability for development results. 4. In their own time (say over a 2 week period) Task Managers should reflect on their current monitoring responsibilities and work practices (using the question checklist shown below), identify any required changes and prepare to present their views at a group discussion/workshop. 5. Facilitate a group discussion/workshop activity to exchange ideas and opinions on any required changes in responsibilities and work practices. Identify commonly agreed conclusions and document them. 6. Prepare proposal for consideration and endorsement by the head of sections/operations; and 7. Agree on next steps, including an implementation plan and a process for follow-up. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 9 ",
        "3.1 Issues Project monitoring cannot take place in a vacuum. It requires a clear project plan against which efficiency and effectiveness issues can then be judged as implementation proceeds. While a project plan should contain adequate detail of proposed monitoring arrangements, it is worth highlighting that the inception phase of a project should be used to confirm and refine these arrangements, as well as providing the opportunity to clearly establish a baseline of information against which progress and performance will be subsequently assessed. Not everything can or should be included in the original project plan. Also, both the project plan and the monitoring arrangements should be subject to ongoing review and revision during the life of the project, based on experience and lessons learned. This is primarily the responsibility of the implementing partner, however the Task Manager can play a valuable role in encouraging the implementing partner to keep project plans, management and monitoring arrangements relevant to context and development need. The Task Manager also needs to understand these key elements of the project context in order to make sense of information that is collected and reported through the project\u2019s internal monitoring systems( 5 ). There are various EC \u2018templates\u2019 used in to support project monitoring, such as the Logframe matrix, the \u2018Programme Estimates\u2019, etc). However, this section of the Reference Document does not deal with specific EC requirements, but rather the key types of information that any project plan should contain (whatever format it is documented in) and that the EC Task Manager should have an understanding of. 3.2 Assess how clear and realistic the project objectives are Monitoring focuses on collecting and using information to help determine whether or not project objectives are being achieved. It is therefore important that project objectives are the right ones in the first place, R e f e r e n c e D o c u m e n t \u2013 S t r e n g t h e n i n g P r o j e c t I n t e r n a l M o n i t o r i n g 10 3. Checking project design and internal monitoring arrangements Good project monitoring builds on good project design. A key role for Task Managers is to check and, if relevant, promote updating and improvements of project design, work plans and other management tools. Secondly, Task Managers should assess the quality/capacity of existing monitoring arrangements, with a view to providing support where required. This section therefore highlights the importance of: (cid:129) having a sound project plan which allows an assessment of performance to be made (by comparing actual achievements against plan), and the need to regularly review, update and improve the plan as required; (cid:129) ensuring that appropriate and useful indicators, targets and baseline information requirements are established; (cid:129) having a clear project workplan which specifies the sequencing and timing of key activities/tasks; (cid:129) assessing the implementing agency\u2019s capacity to manage and monitor the project, and thereby includ- ing appropriate monitoring support activities and resources in the project plan and budget; and (cid:129) considering the incentives to monitor, so that monitoring is not simply undertaken as a bureaucratic requirement. This aims primarily to support the Task Manager playing an enhanced role as dialogue partner and thereby supporting the progressive development of effective internal monitoring. ( 5 ) There are various EC \u2018templates\u2019 used in the cycle of an EC funded project covering monitoring (the Logframe matrix, the \u2018Programme Estimates\u2019, etc\u2026 ). This section of the Reference Document does not deal with specific EC requirements, but rather the key types of information that any project plan should contain (whatever format it is documented in) and that the EC Task Manager should have an understanding of. 1. Objectives and Principles, to guide the approach to monitoring. 2. Development objectives/results and indicators. 3. Targets/quality standards against which performance can be assessed. 4. Information sources and collection methods. 5. Formats and procedures for data collection, recording, analysis and reporting. 6. Monitoring tasks, roles and responsibilities. 7. Reflection, review and decision making processes 8. A communication plan; and 9. Resources and budget for monitoring and reporting. Basic \u2018quality\u2019 elements of any monitoring system should include clearly defined (and documented): europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 10 ",
        "and are themselves clearly specified. The Quality Frame in the PCM Guidelines 2004 provides a set of quality standards directly relevant to the specification of clear objectives, as shown below( 6 ). The Logical Framework Matrix provides a useful tool for thinking through the logical link between project objectives, as well as specifying appropriate indicators and sources of information for project monitoring. A full description of the Logical Framework Approach is provided in Section 5 of the PCM Guidelines (2004). The original Logical Framework Matrix may not be complete or may be out of date by the time the project starts, and therefore needs to be reviewed and, as appropriate improved and/or updated at the start of project implementation (during the inception phase). The Logframe Matrix should also be reviewed, and if necessary revised, on a regular basis during implementation, for example as part of an annual review and planning process. The focus should be on project results and activities (including relevant indicators, sources of information and the planning assumptions), as the project purpose and goal should not be changed except in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the competent higher authorities. 3.3 Quality of indicators, targets and baseline information Indicators The problem of poorly defined, inappropriate and/or impractical project \u2018indicators\u2019 is a commonly voiced concern. If the choice and use of indicators can be improved, it would certainly give greater clarity and focus to monitoring project progress and results for both implementing partners and donors. The following tips can help ensure that the indicators selected are useful: (cid:129) Build on existing systems and capacity \u2013 align and harmonise. The \u2018best\u2019 indicators are generally those that are already being used by partners, are available through existing sources, and/or have been agreed as the key indicators to measure (e.g. Millennium Development Goals - MDGs). This supports ownership, alignment with local systems, donor harmonisation and reduces cost. Projects should generally not set up duplicate or parallel information collection systems, or invent new indicators. Rather they should work with, and as appropriate strengthen/improve, established systems. Consultation and harmonisation with other donors is also important in this regard. (cid:129) Focus on the project purpose (outcome) and results (outputs). Priority should be given to specifying clear indicators at the level of the project purpose and results. The project\u2019s overall objective is often more of a policy or vision statement, and will often be beyond the direct influence of the project. Activities and inputs must also be monitored by implementing partners, but should not be the primary area of focus for the Task Manager. (cid:129) Identify indicators and the source of information at the same time. When identifying appropriate indicators, it is essential to consider the source of information and collection method(s) at the same time. This helps to test the feasibility and practicality of the indicator. Is the information actually collectable, and at reasonable cost? In considering the \u2018means of verification\u2019, it is important to think about the method of data collection (e.g. administrative records, quantitative surveys, qualitative enquiry, national statistics, etc), who will do it, and when/how often. R e f e r e n c e D o c u m e n t \u2013 S t r e n g t h e n i n g P r o j e c t I n t e r n a l M o n i t o r i n g 11 ( 6 ) This, and following sub-sections of the document makes reference to a number of the key principles and tools contained in the Project Cycle Management Guidelines (2004), given that these remain part of the Task Manager\u2019s key knowledge/skill set in supporting the effective management and monitoring of projects. Quality Criteria and Standards The objectives (Overall objective, purpose and results/outputs) and the work programme (activities) are clear and logical, and address clearly identified needs. The project\u2019s Overall Objective is clearly linked to a relevant policy or sector objective, and thus demonstrates how the project will contribute to a long term development outcome. The project\u2019s purpose clearly specifies a direct sustainable benefit(s) that target groups will derive from the imple- mentation of the project. The project\u2019s results (or outputs) describe tangible improvements to services, facilities or knowledge that will directly support the achievement of the project\u2019s purpose. A feasible work programme (set of activities) is described which will allow project results to be delivered over a realistic time-frame. The project design is not overly prescriptive, and allows for necessary changes to operational plans to be made during implementation. 6 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 11 ",
        "(cid:129) Involve responsible managers and stakeholders. Those responsible for collecting and using the information must play the key role in selecting appropriate indicators. Indicators dreamt up and imposed by external agents (e.g. donors and their consultants) are rarely of much use. (cid:129) Involve beneficiaries. If the project is designed to deliver specified benefits to identified beneficiaries (which it should be!), then it is important that their information needs, and their views on the project\u2019s achievements, are included in the design and implementation of the monitoring system (e.g. a strategy for communication with beneficiaries). What indicators would they consider relevant in determining whether or not benefits are being delivered? How can their views (voice) be captured and shared so that they influence management decision making? Where appropriate, are participatory monitoring approaches and activities included in the project\u2019s workplans and budgets? (cid:129) Look for a balance of quantitative and qualitative information. Whether quantitative or qualitative indicators are appropriate (and feasible to collect) will depend on the nature of the project objectives, as well as other contextual factors. Quantitative measures of achievement can have particular advantages (ease of specification, aggregation, and comparison), however they may also give a false (or at least unrealistic) sense of precision. A mix of quantitative and qualitative indicators, which complement each other, is often most useful. (cid:129) Keep it simple and have realistic expectations. More information is not better information. Avoid too many indicators and focus on those most robust and useful to managers. Also recognise that some projects cannot be expected to demonstrate high level results, because the project is just too small, short in duration or just a minor contributor to a wider development initiative. Be realistic about when results can, and cannot, be reasonably demonstrated. Targets Targets, combined with an indicator, help to clarify the scope and scale of the objectives to be achieved and focus management attention on specific measurable results/outcomes. They can be a powerful management tool in terms of driving change. As the saying goes, \u2018What gets measured gets managed\u2019. Targets can be included in contracts, and linked to contract payments, providing clear incentives to perform. However, targets also need to be treated with some caution, particularly in the context of complex development projects. Below are a few tips with respect to selecting, using and reviewing targets: (cid:129) Involve the right people. As with the selection and use of indicators, it is important that those responsible for implementation on the ground take the lead in the setting of targets. Ownership of targets by implementing partners is critical. Donor driven target setting does not have a good track record. Similarly, targets (as well as indicators) should be aligned with partner priorities and systems. (cid:129) Targets need to be realistic. If targets are not realistic (given the operating context, project scope and resources available), they will quickly become irrelevant, are likely to be ignored and/or may simply cause frustration. Choosing appropriate targets requires adequate background research and consultation. They should not be \u2018plucked from the air\u2019. (cid:129) Targets need to be reviewed. Targets need to be regularly reviewed, as part of the ongoing monitoring and review process. This helps ensure their continued relevance. (cid:129) Need incentives to report accurately and honestly. If targets are not met, then the messenger must not be shot! The reasons for the target not being met must first be assessed in an open manner, without initially apportioning blame. The reasons that a target is not met may have nothing to do with the competence of project management. Baseline information The availability of adequate baseline information against which to compare change over time is a common concern. One response is to conduct specific \u2018baseline surveys\u2019. This may be appropriate, however there are many examples of extensive and expensive project specific baseline surveys being conducted that have not, in practice, proved useful. This may be because the data collected is too complex, is not analysed appropriately or in a timely manner, and/or is not understood or used by managers and other decision makers. An original baseline will also be of little or no use if it is not then repeated (using a comparable sample and method) at a future point(s) in time. There remains, therefore, a significant gap between theory (we know we need some kind of baseline) and practice (we often don\u2019t have one, and make do without). A few tips to address the baseline information problem in a practical way are suggested below: (cid:129) Are the information requirements clear? Before embarking on collecting baseline information, the key indicators should have been established and agreed. Otherwise the baseline exercise may loose focus and end up collecting information of little or no relevance. R e f e r e n c e D o c u m e n t \u2013 S t r e n g t h e n i n g P r o j e c t I n t e r n a l M o n i t o r i n g 12 europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 12 ",
        "(cid:129) Minimum information. What is the minimum information that would be useful? It is often best to be very selective, and focus only on the minimum information requirements that will be useful. More information adds complexity and cost. The capacity of the implementing partner to engage in baseline information collection, and to use the resulting information, needs to be carefully considered. (cid:129) Who is interested? This is a key question, because if it is only the donor who has an interest, then it is unlikely that the information collected will be productively used by implementing partners. The baseline then becomes a largely academic exercise, with little prospect of local ownership or capacity building value. (cid:129) Look to existing sources first. There is often a considerable amount of information already available through existing sources \u2013 it may just not be assembled and summarised in a user friendly and accessible form. Administrative records kept by government agencies at local levels, data from statistical offices, reports from research/academic institutions and other donor agency studies will often already contain useful and relevant data. Don\u2019t assume that primary data collection is required, and make sure that other interested donors are consulted and appropriately involved. (cid:129) Do you need to find out what people think? If there are key indicators related to people\u2019s opinions or attitudes, then it is likely that opinion surveys of some kind (or other communication processes) will be required. Opinion surveys can be extremely useful sources of information, however the quality of survey design, administration and the subsequent analysis/interpretation is critical to quality. (cid:129) What is the likely cost and benefit of different baseline options? There will always be more than one option for collecting the required baseline information. Each will have different costs and benefits. The most appropriate approach will need to balance the objectives, with methods and cost. The theoretical ideal is almost never feasible or appropriate. (cid:129) Incremental approach. It may be best to take an incremental approach to collecting baseline information. While the theoretical ideal may be to have all relevant information collected at one point in time, this may just not be possible. The incremental approach may also have the benefit of allowing local partners to be engaged as part of a capacity development strategy. So while there may be no \u2018one point in time snap shot\u2019 \u2013 before the end of the project the capacity of the implementing partner to collect and use baseline information may itself have been developed, and be sustained into the future. (cid:129) Inception phase. Remember also that when baseline data have not been collected during the project preparation phase, the inception phase (say the first 3 to 6 months of a project) provides the opportunity to establish some form of baseline. However, for this to happen, the resources to collect, record, analyse and report the baseline must be made available in the project budget. In conclusion, the period in between the set up of the project team and the drafting of the inception report represents a golden opportunity to check and update/complete (if needed) the project\u2019s Logical Framework Matrix, including indicators/targets and baseline information. The Implementing Partners are at this stage \u2018empowered\u2019 to take leadership and responsibility for the project. However EC Task Managers should support and promote this work in order to ensure the quality of the project\u2019s design and operational plans. 3.4 Check implementation work plans A project\u2019s implementation work plans (also known as activity schedules) are a key tool to support project planning and monitoring. The EC Task Manger\u2019s role is not to prepare the project\u2019s workplans, but rather to help ensure they are being prepared and appropriately used by the implementing partner(s), and are of adequately quality to support effective project planning and monitoring. If the Task Manager has a clear understanding of the value of such work plans, and the steps that need to be taken to prepare them, they can then engage in an informed dialogue with implementing partners to encourage their effective use. Work plans are also required as part of the EC\u2019s \u2018Programme Estimates\u2019 documentation. Whatever format is used, they should provide: (cid:2) a structure for preparing operational work plans (at least annually) against which implementation progress can then be periodically assessed (key activities/tasks, duration, sequencing and responsibilities); (cid:2) an easily understood visual presentation of key activities that can be used to promote participatory planning and review of physical progress; (cid:2) the basis on which resource requirements, budgets and cash flow projects can be prepared; and (cid:2) an opportunity to highlight monitoring, review and reporting tasks within the work programme. A step-by-step approach to the preparation of a work plan/activity schedule can be followed as described below in Box 1.

        "(cid:129) Step 1 \u2013 List Main Activities The main Activities are a summary of what the project must do in order to deliver project results. Each project result/output would normally require a sequence of activities to be undertaken before it can be achieved. An example of a work plan schedule is shown as Figure 1. (cid:129) Step 2 \u2013 Clarify Sequence and Dependencies Once the key activities have been identified and listed, they must be related to each other to determine their: Sequence - in what order should related Activities be undertaken? Dependencies - is the Activity dependent on the start-up or completion of any other Activity? This can best be described with an example. Building a house consists of a number of separate, but inter-related activities: digging the foundations; building the walls; installing the doors and windows; constructing the roof; installing the plumbing, plastering the walls etc. The sequence dictates that digging the foundations comes before building the walls; while dependencies include the fact that you cannot start installing doors and windows until the walls have reached a certain height; Dependencies may also occur between otherwise unrelated Activities that will be undertaken by the same person/group (i.e. the person/group may not be able to complete both tasks at the same time). (cid:129) Step 3 \u2013 Estimate Start-up, Duration and Completion of Activities Specifying the timing involves making a realistic estimate of the duration of each Activity, and then building it into the Activity Sched- ule to establish likely start-up and completion dates. However, it is often not possible to estimate timing with great confidence. To ensure that the estimates are at least realistic, those who have the necessary technical knowledge or experience should be consulted. The most common problem arising in the preparation of activity schedules is to underestimate the time required. This can happen for a number of reasons: (cid:129) omission of essential Activities and tasks; (cid:129) failure to allow sufficiently for interdependence of Activities; (cid:129) failure to allow for resource competition (i.e. scheduling the same person or piece of equipment to do two or more things at once); (cid:129) a desire to impress with the promise of rapid results. (cid:129) Step 4 \u2013 Define Milestones Milestones can provide the basis by which project implementation is monitored and managed. They are key events that provide a measure of progress and a target for the project team to aim at. The simplest milestones are the dates estimated for completion of each Activity or Output \u2013 e.g. \u2018baseline survey completed by end of first quarter of year 1\u2019. (cid:129) Step 5 \u2013 Define responsibilities Depending on the level of detail contained in the Activity schedule, responsibilities can be defined either in terms of the key stake- holders or organizations involved in project implementation, or in terms of individuals within a project team. The purpose is the same, namely to clarify who is primarily responsible for managing the activity and can therefore be held accountable.

        "3.5 Assess monitoring arrangements and capacity One of the key tasks for EC Task Managers is to review existing monitoring arrangements within the implementing partner agency(s) to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Many implementing agencies will welcome advice and assistance that will assist them to collect and use better information, provided it is approached in the right way. All organisations collect, analyse and distribute information, even if they do not call it \u2018monitoring\u2019. Donors must avoid promoting any unnecessary duplication in monitoring arrangements or the creation of parallel systems. In this light, it is also important that the Task Manager understands what other involved donors have done or are doing with respect to monitoring and reporting, to ensure that coordinated and harmonised approaches are developed. A set of guiding questions that can be used to help review and reflect on the status and effectiveness of existing information systems/monitoring arrangements is shown in the box below: R e f e r e n c e D o c u m e n t \u2013 S t r e n g t h e n i n g P r o j e c t I n t e r n a l M o n i t o r i n g 15 Information needs (cid:129) Who are the primary information users?

(cid:129) Is information being analysed at an operational level to help implementers understand what they are doing before being passed up to higher levels? (cid:129) Is the nature of the analysis appropriate and useful? (e.g. are comparisons made between what was planned and actual outcomes)? (cid:129) Is there a functioning review system for bringing together project stakeholders to make decisions based on the available informa- tion? How does this operate and who is involved? Is it coordinated with other donors? Capacity and resources (cid:129) What are the existing physical and financial resources available for monitoring? (cid:129) What is the level of staff skills and their understanding of what is required? (cid:129) Are these adequate? (cid:129) Is there scope for developing local capacity either through providing technical advice, additional financial resources and/or training? Box 2 \u2013 Checklist to assess monitoring arrangements and capacity In order to help ensure that a project\u2019s monitoring systems and activities are relevant to need, feasible to implement and are able to be sustained, both the implementing partner and supporting donors should have some understanding of the implementing agency\u2019s capacity to manage and monitor the project. This may have been adequately assessed and addressed in the project preparation phase, but maybe not. The Task Manager might therefore be able to play a useful role in helping the implementing partner reflect on, and assess, issues relating to internal monitoring capacity, and identifying capacity development activities that can be included in forward work plans and budgets. There are a number of analytical tools that can be used by implementing partners, in collaboration with stakeholders, to undertake assessments of capacity issues. Three examples are briefly profiled below. SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) SWOT is undertaken in three main stages, namely: 1. Ideas are generated about the internal strengths and weaknesses of a group or organization, and the external opportunities and threats. 2. The situation is analysed by looking for ways in which the group/organisation\u2019s strengths can be built on to overcome identified weaknesses, and opportunities can be taken to minimize threats; and 3. A strategy for making improvements is formulated (and then subsequently developed using a number of additional analytical planning tools). europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 15 ",

Rather they should be used to guide and prompt discussion, analysis and the formation of a considered opinion. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 16 ",
        "3.6 Consider the incentives to monitor The issue of incentives to monitor is important. The following list profiles some of the key factors that may act as an incentive (or disincentive) for agency staff to effectively monitor and report on project implementation and results. Most of these factors are related to organisational culture and human resource management practices. (cid:129) Management priority. The organisation\u2019s senior management must demonstrate to staff that they place a high value on the collection, analysis, reporting and use of results-focused management information. There must be a clear demand for this type of information (not just expenditure targets), and when/if it is not forthcoming, there must be clear feedback from senior management to the responsible staff that changes/improvements are required. (cid:129) Information sharing, critical reflection and learning. Effective monitoring is encouraged when senior management (and thus the organisation) promote and encourage staff to be analytical and provide constructive critique. Staff should feel confident to identify and highlight problems impacting on project performance (even when this might reflect negatively on the organisation itself). Opportunities must be provided for staff to share information with their peers and colleagues, both formally and informally. And their must not be a culture of \u2018shooting the messenger\u2019 when potentially bad news is delivered. Identification of poor performance must be seen as a positive opportunity to learn lessons and improve. (cid:129) Time and resources allocated. Monitoring and evaluation work require the application of time and resources. Policy statements and good intentions are not enough. Organisational and project budgets must include specific resources to allow monitoring activities to be undertaken, including the conduct of field visits, organisation and delivery of workshop and training events, contracting of independent expertise, etc. Staff duty statements should also make clear their responsibilities with respect to monitoring and reporting. (cid:129) Feedback provided. If monitoring reports are not acknowledged or clearly used to help inform management decision making, there is little if any incentive to put any value on the activity. Monitoring and reporting may then just be carried out as a bureaucratic requirement, and little if any attention paid to the real value (quality) of the information generated. (cid:129) Recognition and reward. Timely collection, analysis and reporting of useful information needs to be recognised and rewarded. This is part of the feedback process noted above. Sometimes a simple letter or memo from senior management thanking a work unit or staff member for their efforts can be a significant incentive to perform. Other non-financial rewards can be provided, such as broader publication/ dissemination of good work practices, selection to attend interesting seminars/conferences, award of \u2018certificates of appreciation\u2019, etc. Task Managers should seek opportunities to discuss such issues with implementing partners in order to support ongoing improvements in the quality of monitoring and reporting. Providing considered and clear feedback to implementing partners on their project reports is probably the most practical and useful starting point.

        "4.1 Issues The Task Manager needs to collect information from a variety of sources to support his/her understanding of what is happening \u2018on the ground\u2019 with respect to project progress and performance. The primary focus should be on getting good quality information from the project\u2019s internal monitoring system . Analysis of project reports is therefore an important Task Manager responsibility, as well as providing clear feedback to support continuous improvement. Information from internal project monitoring should nevertheless be supplemented by information from other sources such as field visits undertaken by the Task Manager him/herself, EC\u2019s Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM) reports and/or specially commissioned surveys/studies. 4.2 Project progress reports Project progress reports (completed by the implementing partner and/or contractor) are an important source of information for the Task Manager. Indeed, these reports often trigger financial payments. In order to promote aid effectiveness principles (ownership, alignment, harmonisation, etc), EuropeAid should not generally be imposing its own report formats, unless there is nothing else available or being used. Rather, support and advice should be provided to build the capacity of \u2018local\u2019 systems, particularly when working with/through partner government agencies. In those cases where a project is being co-financed with other donors, it is even more important that each donor does not impose a separate set of reporting requirements on the implementing partner (see section 45 of the Paris Declaration). Some key points for the Task Manager to keep in mind include: (cid:129) Limitations. First of all it is important to recognise the limitations of formal document based reporting. While some organisations and cultures rely heavily on the written word, and \u2018paper-based\u2019 reports, many do not. What is appropriate for a well resourced government agency in a developed country, is unlikely be appropriate for an inadequately resourced organisation in a poor country. And even within a more \u2018sophisticated\u2019 and well resourced agency (think of your own!), there is often a surfeit of reports which serve little practical purpose. (cid:129) Information user. As with all other elements of monitoring systems design and implementation, there needs to be continuous effort to give clear focus to the real information needs of specific project stakeholders. The quality of information provided through formal reports must be \u2018reality-tested\u2019 by getting the input of report users. (cid:129) Content/information requirements. The key concern here is to promote a clearer focus on documenting and reporting achievement of results, not simply activities, input use and expenditure. But expectations must also be realistic. It is often the case that results are not delivered or demonstrated until later on in a project\u2019s life. Every progress report (particularly in the earlier years of a project) cannot therefore be expected to have a clear results focus. As long as there remains a clear logical link between the inputs provided, the activities undertaken and the anticipated results, reporting on the progress with delivering inputs and undertaking activities is useful and relevant. The critical issue is that those implementing the project understand that there is a results hierarchy, and that their activities therefore have a higher \u2018purpose\u2019 which must, in time, be demonstrated.

Collecting relevant information This section provides: an overview of some of the Task Manager\u2019s main information sources and how to make the most of them, including: (cid:129) project progress reports from the implementing partner; (cid:129) reports from the Result Oriented Monitoring system; (cid:129) field visits; and (cid:129) other sources such as special research/studies, reports of other donors and informal ongoing contact with stakeholders. The aim is to support the Task Manager\u2019s role as an informed dialogue partner to assist the Task Manager in processing relevant information to fulfil reporting requirements ( 8 ) and to help develop effective and better integrated monitoring systems at the level of each EC Delegation or EuropeAid unit in charge of \u2018centralized operations\u2019.

One way of helping to ensure that the project results hierarchy is understood by those preparing reports, is to clearly separate out the information reporting requirements into different sections, relevant to each level of the hierarchy. Thus having separate sections on: (i) purpose/outcome; (ii) results/outputs; (iii) activities/inputs; and (iv) finance/expenditure can be useful. A key issue then is to help make sure that these sections do not just start duplicating the same information \u2013 particularly the sections on results and on activities (a common problem). Another point to emphasise is that reporting at the purpose and results levels should be focused on the indicators contained in project plan documents. (cid:129) Action oriented. Project progress reports can be usefully structured around 3 simple categories of information: (i) progress/achievements; (ii) problems/constraints encountered; and (iii) action required. The \u2018action required\u2019 section can then be discussed in the appropriate project coordination/management forum, and be used to help track key issues over time.

Figure 5 \u2013 Example format for basic reporting on physical progress (cid:129) Clear and concise. Keeping regular project reports clear and concise is important. Project reports should not try to provide full a discussion of all issues or concerns. They are not a substitute for all other methods of information dissemination and reporting, including face to face meetings, discussions, emails or other types of documented reports. They should only contain high value information that needs to go on record. (cid:129) Frequency. The frequency of reporting should be appropriate to need. As a general principle, the formal reporting should be as infrequent as necessary, given that time spent reporting is often time spent not \u2018doing\u2019. (cid:129) Language. The language in which reports are written can be a significant issue. While a donor like the EC is likely to require its reports in one of their official languages, it must be clearly recognised that this may be of no use to some of the implementing partners. Allowance must therefore be made for language differences, including the provision of resources for translation where this may be required. Whichever language is being used, clear and simple writing which avoids jargon is best! (cid:129) Feedback. If those providing reports do not receive some sort of acknowledgement or direct feedback on the information they provide in formal reports, their interest in, and incentive for, preparing these reports will quickly wane. Even if reports keep coming, it is likely that their quality will decline. An example of the structure and types of information that different types of project report might usefully contain, is provided in Figure 4 (sourced from PCM Guidelines, 2004). However, expectations must clearly be relevant to context. A small NGO run project would not be expected to report in as much detail (or sophistication) as a multi-million Euro engineering project being implemented through an international consulting firm. A simple tabular report format for basic narrative reporting on physical progress is also provided in Figure 5 (also sourced from PCM Guidelines, 2004). A key consideration when looking at such reporting formats is whether or not they help identify key issues that need to be followed up on (action required) and then subsequently tracked. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 20 ",

As indicated in the ROM Handbook of July 2005 \"External Monitoring by independent experts does not substitute for day-to-day monitoring by the Implementing Agency/PMU. ROM provides added value to other information already available\". The ROM system is therefore complementary to monitoring undertaken by Task Managers as well as to internal monitoring conducted by Implementing Partners. Figure 6 below summarises the main elements of ROM, internal monitoring by the project and the monitoring role of EC Task Managers, and highlights the important links between each of these sets of monitoring activities. Attachment 3 provides the format of the ROM Monitoring Report and the Response Sheet to be filled in by the Task Manager.

However, current coverage figures are much lower than this. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 21 ",

(cid:129) Efficiency of Implementation to date: The extent to which results have been achieved at reasonable cost, i.e. how well inputs and activities have been converted into results. (cid:129) Effectiveness to date: The contribution made by the project\u2019s results to the achievement of the project purpose. (cid:129) Impact Prospects: The contribution of the project to wider sector objectives (e.g. the Overall Objective) and to the achievement of overarching policy objectives of the EC. (cid:129) Potential Sustainability: The likelihood of a continuation in the stream of benefits produced by the project after the period of external support has ended. Key factors that impact on the likelihood of sustainability include: (i) ownership by beneficiaries; (ii) policy support/consistency; (iii) appropriate technology; (iv) environment; (v) socio-cultural issues; (vi) gender equity; (vii) institutional management capacity; and (viii) economic and financial viability. Task Managers should make the best possible use of ROM findings. ROM reports provide useful information on ongoing project implementation, in particular under the criteria of efficiency and effectiveness as shown in the box. This information can support better planning of monitoring activities (see Section 7) and fulfilling EC reporting requirements. The quality of ROM findings and recommendations depend heavily on the quality of project plan documents (Logframe and workplan particularly) and on information generated through \u2018internal\u2019 project monitoring systems. Task Managers can therefore enhance the ROM process by supporting the implementing partner to review and update project plans on a regular basis and make ongoing improvements to the quality of internal project monitoring systems. Task Managers need as well to provide input to ROM visits and provide their reaction/opinion to ROM team recommendations in the Task Manager Response Sheet (see attachment 3). If ROM reports are of good quality/useful, Task Managers should also then follow up on whether ROM recommendations have been acted on by the implementing partner (or other identified stakeholders). ROM teams need to ensure they actively engage with Task Managers during their visits, share information and provide expert advice on how a project is performing and how it might be improved. As already said, project implementing partners need to understand the EC\u2019s interest in demonstrating the achievement of results, and take on responsibility for ensuring that their internal project planning and monitoring systems help generate relevant and useful information in this regard. Internal monitoring by implementing partners is particularly important in providing information for ROM teams (and Task Managers) to help then make informed assessments of a project\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. Projects are assessed against five criteria in ROM reports: 4.4 Making \u2018useful\u2019 field visits Monitoring by the Task Manager should include making some short visits to project \u2018sites\u2019 (anywhere where project activities can be observed at first hand). Getting out of the office, away from the computer and phone, and visiting project partners where they work is an essential part of the Task Manager\u2019s job. This is how most of the real learning about what a project is or is not doing takes place. This also directly the supports the role of the Task Manager as an \u2018informed dialogue partner\u2019. It is important that such field visits be planned and organised in collaboration with implementing partners (when appropriate), and also with any other donors who may be involved in the project. Ownership and harmonisation objectives must be appropriately supported. Planning the field visit Making the most of a short-visit is important, whether it is a visit for one day or one week. One way of improving the value of short visits is to put some time and effort into planning and preparing for the visit. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 22 ",

Familiarise yourself with the content of these documents, and discuss issues with the implementing partner and with other colleagues who may be working on the same or similar projects. Clarify the purpose of the visit: What will the visit achieve? Is the purpose of the visit primarily to \u2018audit/check\u2019, or is there also a support/advisory role to be played? What will the implementing agency/stakeholders get out of the visit? How can you add value? Identify the key issues that need to be addressed during the visit (look at the plan, the key assumptions and any issues raised in previous progress reports). Develop a preliminary list of key questions that it would be useful to ask and have answered. Clarify who will/should be involved in the visit, both in terms of the \u2018monitoring team\u2019 and other stake- holders who you wish to meet with. Involve the implementing partner and other donors who may be interested in participating. Think through and clarify the proposed approach/methods to be used to collect, record and analyse information: Who do you want to meet, where and when? Do you want to conduct group or individual interviews? Do you want to meet with women separately from men? What do you want to see \u2013 physically inspect? What administrative records would you like to see? How will you avoid \u2018bias\u2019 in terms of who you meet and what you are shown by partners/stakeholders who may try to show you only \u2018success\u2019 stories? Further develop a checklist(s) of key questions. Develop an indicative itinerary for the visit and confirm with those who need to know. Identify the resources that will be required and who will provide them/pay. Confirm that these resources are available (i.e. transport/fuel, accommodation, meeting rooms, etc). Clarify the expected output of the visit, including reporting requirements and how information will be \u2018fed back\u2019 to those who need to know. No 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Done? Box 3 \u2013 Checklist of things to do/consider in planning a field visit Where appropriate, the Task Manager should pay particular attention to thinking through how he/she can add value to the project through the field visit. Providing project implementing partners with good practice examples of project monitoring reports, making suggestions about how to more effectively collect and analyse data, and/or clarifying EC monitoring and reporting expectations might all be useful activities. Question checklists for field visit monitoring Question checklists are a relatively simple and practical tool which can help make regular field visits a more structured activity and support the production of a more consistent and relevant base of management information. As part of conducting field visits, the Delegation/Unit may therefore choose to establish a common monitoring report/assessment checklist format that Task Managers can use. This would logically be linked to the information elements required in the Reporting requirements (CRIS reports). Some general tips with respect to developing such checklists are provided below. While a clearly structured checklist is useful, it should not restrict the user taking initiative in asking some other questions or asking questions in a different order, but should rather help ensure that all the important issues are covered. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 23 ",

These might include: (cid:129) Ongoing informal contacts with project stakeholders and other colleagues: Informal contacts are important. Once personal relationships have been developed, including a degree of mutual respect and trust, then the quantity and quality of information that can be accessed is usually greatly increased. Working lunches, coffee shop meetings, discussions around the golf-course, etc \u2013 can all have an important part to play in understanding what is really going on! (cid:129) Other local development agencies and civil society groups: There are often other development agencies or civil society groups that have an interest in, and/or knowledge of, the work that the project is undertaking. Making contact with such agencies/groups, and sharing information with them, can be an extremely valuable additional source of insights into what is happening within the broader project environment. (cid:129) Other government agencies: While a project may be working through one specific institutional implementing partner, there may be other government agencies that are working in related or complementary fields, and which collect information relevant to monitoring a project\u2019s performance. For example, Department\u2019s of Finance and Planning, and National Statistics Offices, may have information which can supplement or complement that being collected through a project\u2019s internal monitoring systems. (cid:129) Other international donors: There are often other international donors working on the same or similar development issues and with the same implementing partners. They may be conducting their own monitoring activities in one form or another, and sharing information and ideas with them can again support the project monitoring process. Opportunities for donors to harmonise their approaches to project planning and monitoring, and to align these with partner systems, should be actively pursued. (cid:129) Local media: It is always worth keeping an eye on the local media to see what is being reported in areas of interest relevant to a project. The following principles should be kept in mind when preparing a project monitoring checklist(s): (cid:129) the staff/officers responsible for conducting interviews/monitoring visits should draft the checklist(s); (cid:129) checklist should be reviewed by Task Managers/supervisors at higher levels to ensure accuracy, brevity and specificity; (cid:129) checklists should be field tested by those who are going to use them, the results reviewed and appropriate modifications made; (cid:129) checklists should be brief and specific. Different checklists could be prepared to cover different issues. This allows for more flexibility in the field and enables staff to decide on the issues to be covered during particular visits; (cid:129) checklists should be used as a guide and should not restrict the interviewer from inquiring about other matters as they arise. (cid:129) they help to ensure that key issues are covered during field monitoring visits; (cid:129) they help to ensure consistency and comparability of reporting; (cid:129) the discipline of checklists helps to institutionalise a system of project monitoring which assists incoming staff to familiarise themselves with the project and thus become effective more quickly; (cid:129) a structured information collection and reporting system is an important ingredient for developing an institutional memory. Ad hoc systems tend to become very personalised and break down when the officers leave; and (cid:129) the completed checklists may provide some raw data for subsequent analysis, if the questions are adequately structured. The main potential benefits of staff/Task Managers using question checklists are: europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 24 ",

A large amount of information produced through monitoring activities can be wasted if it is not appropriately analysed and presented. When thinking about the way in which data should be analysed, different approaches are usually required for quantitative and qualitative data. By definition, quantitative data involves numbers that can be subjected to various forms of statistical analysis. Qualitative data on the other hand usually provides information on people\u2019s views, opinions or observations and is often presented (at least initially) in a narrative form( 10 ). An appropriate balance between the two is often best \u2013 with the interpretation of quantitative data being \u2018enriched\u2019 through an understanding of \u2018what people think\u2019. Also, while some types of project lend themselves to quantifiable monitoring (e.g. those focused on increasing agricultural production, or increasing immunisation coverage) others do not (e.g. institutional capacity building within an environmental research agency). 5.2 Tips and Tools Data analysis The following table provides an overview of some of the main methods that can be used to analyse and present quantitative data in a way which project managers (and other stakeholders) are likely to find useful. In most cases there is no need for any complex statistical analysis. 5. Adding value through data analysis This section provides: a brief profile of some of the main ways in which quantifiable data can be analysed to help turn it into useful \u2018performance information\u2019. This aims primarily to support the Task Manager\u2019s role as dialogue partner, through the Task Manager encouraging implementing partners to look at ways in which they can \u2018add value\u2019 and optimize the use of the data they are collecting through their own internal monitoring systems. ( 10 ) However it is of course possible to turn qualitative information (people\u2019s views and opinions) into a quantitative form, such as through the use of questionnaire formats which ask respondents to rate or rank preferences, priorities, interests, etc. Description Monitoring is primarily about comparing what was originally planned with what actually happens. This analy- sis should therefore form the base of any monitoring, review and reporting system. For example, if we learn from survey results that agricultural production among targeted farmers has increased by one tonne per ha (for specified crops), as a result of adopting new husbandry practices, we need to know how this com- pares to what was planned in order to make an assessment of performance. If the plan was to increase pro- duction by 2 tonnes, and all the resources/costs originally budgeted have been applied/spent, this could then indicate a problem either with the technology, with project management, and/or the original plan estimates. Calculating percentages and ratios is a particularly useful way of presenting performance information. Assuming that the planned targets are reasonably accurate/realistic, such ratios help us see how close we are to achieving what we originally intended. If for example we are comparing planned with actual performance, low percentage figures immediately highlight areas of potential concern and should trigger an analysis of cause and subsequent decisions on taking remedial action.

Interpretation of the data is thus key. For example, a project may not be achieving its objectives and targets for a variety of reasons, including: (cid:129) unrealistic initial objectives and targets (poor design); (cid:129) constraints outside the project\u2019s direct control, such as the actions (or inaction) of another Government Ministry; and/or (cid:129) poor project management. These reasons need to be understood if appropriate corrective actions are to be identified and implemented. Data analysis will often therefore raise additional questions, which then need to be investigated further by the implementing partner and other concerned stakeholders. Description An analysis of available data over time can be extremely useful in revealing how the project is performing. This can help us to see whether things are getting \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018worse\u2019 (i.e. in immunization coverage rates), and allows seasonal variability to be identified. Comparison with previous periods can also be useful when there are no clear current targets for the activ- ity being monitored or reviewed. Reference to what happened at the same time in previous periods/years can at least then provide an indication of what results might reasonably be expected. When analysing trends over time it is it is important to remember that one must compare \u2018like with like\u2019. The use of a consistent set of indicators (measuring the same thing in the same way at different points in time) is therefore essential. Projects which are being implemented (or providing support) in a number of different locations can be monitored in such a way that geographic variations in performance can be identified. Aggregate service delivery or \u2018outcome\u2019 indicators may show results that accord generally with planned targets, but not reveal location specific problems that need to be addressed. An analysis of data from different districts, provinces or regions may therefore reveal issues requiring management attention. As with geographic variance, it may be important to monitor variance in outcomes between different social groups. For example, an important concern for many projects will be the impact of the project on both women and men. This requires that data be disaggregated by gender and this then be systematically analysed on a regular basis. It is also important to investigate if the project is including specific vulnerable groups, including the disabled (i.e. in terms of building design). Poverty alleviation projects will also be concerned with identifying which groups within the community are benefiting from project interventions. An agricultural extension project, for example, which targets low income farmers or female headed households should be collecting data which will allow the client profile to be analysed. Many service delivery activities can be usefully monitored by establishing, and then collecting information on, work-norms or standards. For example \u2013 an agency\u2019s response time to requests for assistance, waiting lists for minor surgery, the number of prisoners held on remand and the duration of their detention before sentencing, or pupil/teacher ratios \u2013 can all be analysed and compared with agreed work norms or stan- dards to help managers measure performance and identify where improvements might need to be made.

Project Steering Committees are one such review forum. The main points are that they should be regular (pre-planned), they should have a clear agenda and structure, and should be adequately resourced within the project work plan and budget. Where possible, the review process should be linked into the implementing partner\u2019s own established processes for conducting project/programme performance reviews. The Task Manager can play an important role in promoting effective regular reviews by emphasising their value, encouraging stakeholder participation and making useful EC contributions to the discussions and analysis.( 12 ) 6.1 Regular internal reviews Some tips and tools to help plan and manage regular reviews are provided below. Purpose Regular review meetings are an extremely useful mechanism to support: (cid:129) reflection on project progress; (cid:129) exchange of information and ideas; (cid:129) team building; (cid:129) problem solving; and (cid:129) forward planning. Regular reviews may be more or less formal \u2013 depending primarily on their purpose and who is expected to participate. Generally speaking, it is useful to have an \u2018internal\u2019 review of project progress (that involves key individuals directly involved in project implementation) on at least a six-monthly basis. A checklist of things to consider in organizing and managing regular internal reviews is provided below: 6. Regular internal reviews and sharing information This section provides: (cid:129) A summary of tips and tools for organising effective internal review meetings; and (cid:129) An overview of options for promoting effective communication and information sharing among stakehold- ers. The aim is primarily to support the role of the Task Manager as a dialogue partner, through highlighting practical issues and options that can be discussed with implementing partners regarding the value of regular internal reviews. Monitoring is closely linked to communication and EC Task Managers have an ( 11 ) Regular internal reviews are not the same as project reviews (e.g. mid-term reviews) which are traditionally led by donor agencies, with the aim of providing an independent assessment of project performance. ( 12 ) The EC\u2019s PCM Guidelines of 2004 also contain specific guidance on promoting participation and using facilitation skills (Section 8 of the Guidelines) europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 27 ",

Specifically consider whether there are opportunities for involving other relevant donors. (cid:129) Confirm the date, time and location of the meeting with participants. (cid:129) Prepare a draft agenda and distribute it for comment/additions (see next page). (cid:129) Assemble relevant data/information (including management/monitoring reports) and distribute copies in advance to those attending the review meeting. (cid:129) Organise other logistics for the review meeting (e.g. secretarial support, transport, venue, required equipment/materials for presentations, refreshments, etc). The review meeting Managing the review meeting is primarily the responsibility of the \u2018chairperson\u2019. The chair should help ensure that: (cid:129) the available time is effectively managed, based on the agreed agenda/timetable; (cid:129) each participant is given adequate opportunity to share his/her views (the meeting is not dominated by the loudest/most talkative); (cid:129) key issues are clarified; (cid:129) disagreements are cordially resolved; (cid:129) a problem solving approach is taken; (cid:129) agreement is reached (by consensus or vote) on key actions that need to be taken; (cid:129) an accurate record of discussions and decisions is taken. Follow-up Key follow-up actions should include: (cid:129) Finalisation and dissemination of a record of key decisions taken/agreements reached. (cid:129) Revision to forward work plans as required. An indicative agenda for a review meeting is provided in attachment No 5. 6.2 Communication and information dissemination Issues Formal reporting and structured internal reviews are part of the communication and information sharing process. However, there is often a need to communicate more widely with a broader group of stakeholders, including beneficiaries who may not be directly engaged in the formal processes. Communication and information dissemination promote accountability, transparency, and shared learning. Communication includes listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating and learning for sustained and meaningful change. The Task Manager should: (i) support the IP in drafting a communication plan; (ii) support the IP to effectively communicate; and (iii) ensure that he/she also communicates and shares information effectively. It is particularly important to clarify roles and responsibility in this area between the Task Manager and the implementing partners following appropriate guidance( 13 ) that clearly indicates their respective roles for each type of communication activity.

As ever, resources are required (e.g. in the project budget) to allow these things to happen. It is therefore important that communication activities are considered during the design of the project. There are many possibilities to be considered, the choice of which will depend on the objectives of communication, the target group(s) and resources available. Some options are listed below.( 14 ) (cid:129) Community meetings. Projects which are working with poor communities should look for regular opportunities to provide information, and seek comment and feedback, directly with these groups. Community meetings, appropriately organised and facilitated, and with useful supporting informational materials, provide a valuable means by which effective communication can be ensured. (cid:129) Printed media. Newsletters, posters, newspapers, journals, magazines and specific project reports are all potential methods for communicating about project activities, results and lessons learned. Print media can be practical and cost effective, but it depends on having a literate audience. (cid:129) Photos/Film/video. With the wide-spread availability of relatively cheap film-capable cameras, computers and projectors/beamers, it is no longer essential to have professional film makers to produce useful slide shows and short films which help explain what a project is doing on the ground. Such materials can also be burned to cd and widely distributed for others to access and use. (cid:129) Radio and television. In relatively remote rural areas, radio can be a particularly effective medium to communicate in a cost effective manners. Televisions are also increasingly widely available, and consideration should be given to using local TV stations to run short news items on what the project is doing and achieving. (cid:129) Web-based. Project web-sites can be a very useful way of making information available, although it is not in itself a proactive way of communicating. Nevertheless \u2013 it allows all manner of project related information to be made available remotely to those who are interested, and saves on the time and effort required to print and post paper based materials out to interested parties. (cid:129) Seminars and conferences. Organising seminars and conferences about project activities, or at least participating in relevant events that have been organised by others, is also a means of communicating. Is the project making maximum use of such opportunities? (cid:129) Drama/theatre and music. In some circumstances, drama/theatre and music should be considered as a useful mechanism for communicating.

At present, many Task Managers simply do not have either the time or resources available. These resources should therefore be explicitly accounted for in each Delegation/Unit\u2019s work plans and budgets (such as in the Annual Management Plan), based on a \u2018screening\u2019 and risk analysis of each project within the overall portfolio. A three-step process is proposed including: 1. Project \u2018screening\u2019 , to categorise projects according to their \u2018risk\u2019 of not achieving objectives/results, using a checklist and a rating scale. 2. Identification of specific issues that need to be \u2018tracked\u2019 , and therefore monitored. 3. The development and use of a \u2018Project Portfolio Monitoring Plan\u2019 (PPMP). This would help ensure that monitoring tasks (and relevant capacity development initiatives that support internal monitoring capacity) are appropriately prioritised and explicitly considered in annual work planning processes within each Delegation/Unit. The process of preparing and then reviewing the PPMP could also support the preparation of External Assistance Management Reports. The proposed steps in the process are briefly described below. It important to note that these tools are proposed as supporting internal management and are not intended to become a new set of reporting requirements from Delegations. Results from this analytical process should primarily to be used \u2018within\u2019 each Delegation/Unit, but might nevertheless support regular reporting (such as completing/updating the CRIS report, the preparation of Annual Management Plans and External Assistance Management Reports). Each delegation will decide how frequently to conduct this process depending on the context and on project performance. 7.2 Project screening This could involve: 1. Assembling a list of all ongoing projects (in the implementation phase, or due to start in the coming year). Basic details should include: (i) project name; (ii) start/finish date and duration; (iii) total value (EC contribution); (iv) EC funding source/budget line; (v) lead implementing partner; (vi) geographic location of main activities; (vii) if covered by ROM; (viii) if other donors involved; and (ix) responsible EC Task Manager. 2. Screening each project against a set of issues related to the risk of a project not meeting its objectives. This will help identify what the risk issues are, assist in determining a risk rating for each project, and help identify what follow-up may be required with respect to project monitoring/support activities. Four categories of \u2018risk\u2019 could be used, to assist in prioritising which projects need particular monitoring attention and support. (cid:129) No risk (1): there is no apparent risk of the project not delivering planned results. (cid:129) Low risk (2): the risk of the project not delivering results is low, but some issues have been identified which may require follow-up. 7. Organizing EC monitoring activities This section provides: (cid:129) A proposed process and example format for screening a portfolio of projects to determine their rela- tive \u2018risk\u2019 and the critical issues that need to be monitored and \u2018tracked\u2019; (cid:129) A proposed process and example format for preparing an overall project portfolio monitoring plan at the level of each Delegation/Unit; (cid:129) A proposed format for compiling a simple \u2018overview table\u2019 of all projects at the level of each Delega- tion/Unit, based on information collected through existing information systems. The primary aim is to support the Task Manager in progressively developing more effective and better integrated monitoring systems at the level of each EC Delegation or EuropeAid Unit in charge of \u2018cen- tralized operations\u2019. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 30 ",

(cid:129) High risk (4): serious shortcomings have been identified and the risk is high that the project will not produce its results. Significant support/follow-up is required. Figure 7 presents a proposed project Screening Table which could be used to help determine a project\u2019s relative risk rating. The \u2018issues\u2019 included are provided as examples only, and each Delegation/responsible unit should feel free to adapt/change these to suit their specific context and needs. It's nevertheless important that a standardised format is agreed upon at the level of each delegation/unit with a view to ensure consistency of the screening exercises. Project Name: Start & Finish: Value: IP: Date of assessment: Task Manager: General Issues Risk rating (1, 2, 3, 4) Issues for follow-up/tracking 1. Complexity and/or political sensitivity of the project (e.g. anti-corruption, human rights, nuclear power) 2. Level of identified environmental or social risks (e.g. re-settlement, dam/irrigation, ethnic minorities) 3. Relative value of the project 4. Other / \u2018X\u2019 factors (e.g. significant changes in project context and relevant sector policy, conflict zone, etc) Project performance related issues Risk rating (1, 2, 3, 4) Issues for follow-up/tracking 1. Quality of project design and/or annual work plans (e.g. Logframe, indicators and workplan schedules) 2. Activities carried out and results achieved to date 3. Quality of project monitoring system 4. Institutional capacity of project implementing partner (management systems) 5. Financial execution (against budget and time) 6. Implication of the contracting deadline (d+3) 7. Others Overall risk rating for project In the process of completing the table, some issues may not be relevant if a project has not yet commenced implementation, or is in the very early stages of implementation and there is therefore no \u2018performance\u2019 data. The rating for such criteria could then just be left blank. The overall risk rating given to each project should be based on a broad qualitative judgement of the \u2018risk\u2019 issues considered, and their relative importance. While it is possible to add all ratings, divide by the number of issues considered and determine an average score, this may imply a misleading level of quantified/statistical precision. The screening table should be completed using information from all relevant sources, including Project Progress Reports, CRIS implementation reports, ROM reports, Task Manger field visits, etc. Figure 7 \u2013 Project Screening Table europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 31 ",

All the information provided by the screening table, its overall rating on risks and the issues that need special follow-up, should then be used to establish priorities to be fed into the Project Portfolio Monitoring Plan. The screening exercise and the identification of key issues to be tracked should also support the progressive building of institutional memory within each delegation/unit and could also facilitate the completion of the CRIS Implementation Report (in particular section 7 and 8 as shown in the table at Attachment 4). 7.4 Project Portfolio Monitoring Plan Following project screening and identification of key issues, a project portfolio monitoring plan can then be prepared (and subsequently updated on an ongoing basis). The primary purpose of preparing such a plan is to systematically think through what needs to be done to monitor the project portfolio, when and with what resource implications. It should assist in developing a broad overview of the portfolio and better targeting of scarce resources for monitoring support. Suggested steps would include: (cid:129) For each project, or group of projects, consider the required nature of monitoring, or monitoring support that needs to be provided by the EC Task Manager(s). Options might include such things as field visits, attendance at review workshops or formal project meetings, participation with other donors in joint monitoring/review missions, ROM team visits, organisation and delivery of specific capacity building activities (e.g. monitoring workshops/training), planned evaluations, and/or \u2018remote\u2019 monitoring activities such as assessment and response to formal monitoring reports and conference calls/video hook-ups. Harmonisation of monitoring with other donors should also be explicitly considered. (cid:129) Prepare a draft summary of the proposed Monitoring Plan (for the whole Delegation/Unit) which should include consideration of the key monitoring tasks, responsibility, timing and any significant resource implications. An example blank format for a Project Portfolio Monitoring Plan is shown at Figure 8, while Figure 9 includes example information for one project.

The use of CfPs is now the general rule when dealing with non-state actors. Geographical budget lines also use CfPs to finance non-state actors (such as through the Asia Links Programme), and this approach is also being used by Financing Facilities such as the Water and Energy Initiatives. The primary distinction between using CfPs and using \u2018direct arrangements\u2019 with partner governments relates to the scale and scope of projects, and the management responsibilities of the EC at different stages of the project cycle. With respect to project monitoring, the CfP approach poses particular challenges, because: (cid:2) If calls are managed and monitored from HQ, Task Managers may have little or no opportunity to have direct contact with implementing partners or physically visit project \u2018sites\u2019; (cid:2) There are often a large number of relatively small projects, which are geographically dispersed and implemented by many different agents; (cid:2) EC Delegations may not feel responsible for projects funded through CfPs if they have not been adequately involved in the call process; and (cid:2) Non-state actors funded through CfPs may be particularly protective of their independence, place significant emphasis on their advocacy roles, and be unfamiliar with institutional reporting requirements. These particular challenges give added emphasis to the need for Task Managers to support the development of effective internal project monitoring systems (e.g. within NGO partner agencies), as well as playing an enhanced role in political dialogue with partners. The review of Task Manager roles suggested in Section 2 of this Document is therefore particularly important in this context. europaid 071207 orange 021C.qxd 12/7/07 10:53 AM Page 35 ",

In particular, the use of project progress reports from implementing partners, ROM reports and information sourced from field visits and participation at regular internal project review meetings should assist in completing sections 5 and 7. A description of the information required in the CRIS Implementation Report is provided below: Sections to be filled first time the operation is registered in CRIS or if context, objectives and envisaged results are modified during implementation. Heading Description of contents 1. Description Describe the project including: (i) overall objective, purpose and results; (ii) main activities, (iii) location and duration, and (iv) cost and key inputs. (Maximum 25 lines) 2. Origin, context and Briefly describe the: key assessments a) rationale/justification for the project, the link with the Commission policy and with the programming document and any complementarities with other ongoing and planned initiatives b) main conclusions arising from the assessment of the project context, namely: (i) link to partner policy priorities; (ii) stakeholders\u2019 analysis, including institutional capacity assessment; (iii) problem analysis; and (iv) strategy analysis. (Maximum 30 lines) Sections to be updated regularly (at least every six months with the EAMR). Heading Description of contents 3. Summary of project Summarize the main features of the implementation of the project high implementation lighting main developments, problems encountered solutions given and lessons learned. (15 lines) 4. Changes in context Summarise changes in the project operating environment/context and in the key (positive or negative) since the start of the project, which may impact on assessment areas the project\u2019s relevance and/or feasibility, mentioning where relevant major developments since the last report. Reference should be made to assumptions/risks and to the quality of project management, highlighting any implications for modifications to project plans. (Maximum 25 lines) 5. Progress in Summarise state of progress since the start of the project towards achieving achieving objectives the project purpose, delivering results and implementing main activities, mentioning where relevant major developments since the last report. Compare progress against plans (using Logframe indicators as appropriate). Focus on positive achievements and prospects for the sustainability of benefits. (Maximum 25 lines) 6. Financial execution Indicate time elapsed as % of total project duration as well as project contracting commitments and payment rates. Briefly review causes of possible deviations from plans and if necessary indicate correcting measures. (Maximum 10 lines) 7. Issues arising and What constraints/problems are currently being faced? What action has action required been taken, and by whom, to address these? What further action is required to support effective implementation, by whom and when? (Maximum 25 lines) 8.

External Assistance Management Report The External Assistance Management Report is completed by Heads of Delegation (and Directorates) on a bi-annual basis. It should make an assessment of achievements/progress each year with reference to the previous Annual Management Plan. In order to effectively complete the EAMR, reliable information on the progress/achievements and issues/constraints relevant to the project and program portfolio must be available. This highlights the importance of having effective project/program monitoring systems in place within each Delegation/Unit \u2013 that capture information from internal, external and Delegation based monitoring systems, including from ongoing dialogue with partners (formal and informal). The format of the EAMR includes the following main section headings. Specific points relevant to project monitoring have been included as dot-points under \u2018Operational Aspects\u2019: Executive Summary 1. Coordination with other Actors 2. Operational Aspects (cid:129) Project pipeline and new commitments (cid:129) Implementation \u2013 including status of projects/programs corresponding to CRIS & ROM reports, and activities to reinforce and strengthen Delegation\u2019s monitoring of ongoing operations (cid:129) Evaluation \u2013 including reporting on evaluations included in the AMP, and activities undertaken to integrate evaluation findings into implementation 3. Internal control issues 4. Human resource and training Attachment 5 Example of a review meeting agenda If an implementing partner is unsure about how a review meeting might best be structured, the following indicative agenda could be used as an example and focus for discussion: Time Topic 9.00-10.30 Welcome and introductions. Statement of purpose of the meeting. Review of agenda \u2013 topics, timing, responsibilities for presentations, etc. Summary overview of issues arising from last review meeting, actions to be taken and responsibilities. Brief reports from participants on progressing these follow-up actions (Issues Tracking). 10.30-11.00 Morning break 11.00-12.30 Overview of the workplan and budget for the period under review, including key tasks, indicators and targets (i.e. using Logframe matrix, activity schedules and resource/budget schedules as appropriate). Presentation of available data/information on physical progress made in implementing the work plan and achieving results. Highlight areas of success and concern. Present summary of financial records. 12.30-1.30 Lunch break 1.30-3.00 Further discussion on \u2018performance\u2019 issues (comparing planned with actual performance) and clarification of the reasons for any significant deviation.
