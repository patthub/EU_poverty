        "2 Abstract A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is a comprehensive and economy-wide database recording data on all transactions that take place in an economy over a period of time, usually one year. It has two principal objectives. On the one hand, it presents a complete picture of the economy, taking into account the economy's structure and the interrelationships between economic agents. On the other hand, it provides a coherent framework to analyse how the economy works and to predict the effects of policy interventions through its use as a database in multisectoral linear models by calculating multipliers, and in the calibration and exploitation of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. This report presents the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire's SAM for 2015, with the main purpose of providing a suitable database for implementing and evaluating the country's own developmental social and economic policies and initiatives. For this purpose, the basic structure of a SAM is presented, explaining the meaning of each account. Then, the accounts included in the SAM of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are explained in detail covering the main aspects of its construction and estimation. This SAM has the advantage of including the Household Production for Household Consumption (HPHC) approach and a high disaggregation of the agricultural and food sector, which is very important for an economy like the Ivorian case. Finally, the SAM is used as a database to perform a descriptive analysis of the Ivorian economy and to obtain results of employment, output and value added multipliers with the application of a linear multiplier analysis. Annex 3 explains how to download the matrix available online. ",
        "3 1 Introduction The European Commission is committed to cooperate with developing countries to provide solutions to problems related to inequality, nutrition and food security. This is carried out by evaluating related policies, facilitating the access of researchers in these countries to analytical tools that allow them to carry out such assessments on their own. In this sense, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's in-house science service, is committed to provide support for: i) improvement of information systems on agriculture, nutrition and food security, ii) policy and economic analysis to support policy decision-making process and iii) scientific advice on selected topics concerning sustainable agriculture and food and nutrition security. In particular, the Economic of Agriculture Unit of the JRC Directorate D, Sustainable Resources, is responsible to elaborate the methodology and tools to provide economy-wide analysis related to sustainability of policies in the sectors of agri-food, sustainable resources and fight against food and nutrition insecurity. The analyses and tools proposed should support the EU institutions, and the partner countries for the elaboration and assessment of policies and demand-driven technical and scientific advice. Among possible scientific tools, economic simulation models represent interrelationships between selected economic variables and provide a simplified representation of economic reality to be used to quantify impacts of policy changes (i.e., ex-ante policy analysis). The construction of databases to provide evidence-base policy support to partner countries is part of the objectives of the Pan-Africa Network for Economic Analysis of Policies (PANAP). PANAP is a network among academic/research and institutional partners collaborating with the JRC in developing research on agricultural economics and policy issues with a focus on Africa. PANAP is part of the Action Agenda of the Political Declaration of the 3rd AU-EU Agriculture Ministerial Conference held in Rome on 21 June 2019 (EC Decision C(2019) 4277). At the launch and first meeting of PANAP (6-8 November 2019, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) key stakeholders, researchers, data analysists, policy makers, from national and multilateral institutions engaged in fruitful discussion on the role of science in supporting policy decision making in Africa with focus on the farming and food sectors (Morokong & Ferrari, 2020). The objective of PANAP is to strengthen the liaison between researchers/scientists and policy makers in Africa, including relevant multi-lateral African institutions, and to stimulate their cooperation on selected topics linked to policy priorities in Africa. PANAP will also contribute in understanding and resolving scientific issues in the fields of agriculture and food security to support efficient policies. It will also facilitate achieving sustainability of the agri-food sectors to enhance food and nutrition security in alignment with the Malabo Declaration Commitment 3 on ending hunger in Africa by 2025 and SDG 1 and 2. Cote d'Ivoire is a Western African country, being the largest economy member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) after Nigeria and Ghana. Therefore, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is one of the countries analysed in this context. 1 The main pillar in the macroeconomic analysis is the use of a tailored version of a single-country Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to analyse some of the agricultural and rural policy priorities to reduce poverty and inequalities, considering the specificities of the economy in the country. ( 1 ) Similar SAMs databases have been constructed for other African countries, for example for Senegal (Boulanger et al., 2017), Kenya (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a), Ethiopia (Mengistu et al., 2019), and Ghana (Ferreira et al., 2021). All these SAMs are freely available in the JRC DataM repository. ",
        "4 In the case of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the country has suffered a period of political and economic instability, due to the coup d'\u00e9tat in 1999 and the post-electoral crisis in 2011. Since 2012, the country show a period of consistent economic growth, with an increase in the GDP per capita and exports (Ducroque et al., 2018). However, despite a decrease in poverty, the poverty rate remains high (representing 46.3%), especially in rural areas, according to the 2015 household survey (ENV, 2015). The agriculture sector is key in the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's economy. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is a leading producer of many agricultural products, being the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa. Due to the strong dependence on agriculture and related activities, there is particular interest in the agricultural sectors considering the National Agricultural Investment Program (NAIP II - 2017-2025). Furthermore, there are remarkable differences in employment and welfare between the rural and urban zones of the districts. Hence, most of the employed population lives in urban areas (57.1%). The city of Abidjan has a relatively important economic weight and concentrates 22.1% of the total employed population. Moreover, in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire the employment is predominantly informal, representing 91.8% of employed persons and more than 70% of the employed population have at most primary level of education (ENV, 2015). Therefore, the promotion of policies focus on the economic and social development in the country requires the elaboration of specific database that provide a description of the national and regional economy with the interlinkage between them and the disaggregation of the main sectors. The calibration of CGE model requires a complex database system, called Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The estimation of a new SAM for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is an important achievement itself, because it provides detailed information about the economic structure of the country and serves, also, as main database for linear multisectoral and CGE models. Whereas the latest C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM for 2015 has been estimated by Diallo (2018), this report presents significant modifications and extensions to the SAM to obtain a database for the analysis of different policies at stake. The main improvements in the SAM presented in this report include the regionalisation of agricultural activities, factors of production and households. This facilitates the identification and analysis of those households that produce both for own consumption and commerce. The SAM developed shows the breakdown of the accounts by district, rural and urban areas for households, and by skill level for the labour factor. The previously constructed SAMs for African countries available in the JRC DataM repository have been used for policy analysis, considering the calculation of multipliers as well as the application of CGE models. To mention a few examples, the SAM for Ethiopia and Kenya were used to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on economic performance and poverty incidence, evaluating the effectiveness of the government recovery measures (Nechifor et al., 2020a; Nechifor et al., 2020b). Linking the CGE model with a microsimulation approach, the Kenya SAM was used to evaluate the food security impacts of expanding fertilizer capacities (Boulanger et al., 2020) and due to macroeconomic outcomes of the pandemic (Nechifor et al., 2021). For Senegal, the SAM was used to analyse policy options for the development of the agriculture sector by applying a CGE model (Boulanger et al., 2018). Furthermore, the multipliers were calculated using SAMs, for example, to analyse the capacity of the primary sector in Kenya suggesting policy recommendations (Mainar-Casup\u00e9 et al., 2020). In the case of Egypt, Osman et al. (2021) used a mixed multiplier analysis to identify the seasonal agricultural activities with high production and income multipliers suitable for policy promotion. For Ethiopia, Boulanger et al. (2019) analysed the effects of different policy ",
        "5 options to support the creation of rural job opportunities by calculating the employment multiplier and using a CGE model. The SAM developed in this report and freely available in the JRC DataM repository is expected to be a useful database for various types of policy impact analysis and decision making. This report is structured as follows: the concept, general issues and the accounts description of Social Accounting Matrices are presented in Section 2, while Section 3 describes the structure and estimation of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015. This section builds upon an introductory background on the Home Production for Home Consumption issue, a key aspect of this new SAM. Then, the structure and estimations of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM is presented, detailing the accounts and data basis used and the final adjustments, SAM balancing and disaggregation procedures. The Section 4 shows a description of the Ivorian economy structure using SAM data and a simple multiplier analysis is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the SAM linear models in policy impact assessment. Finally, Section 5 includes some conclusions, and the Annexes shows some additional tables and presents the downloadable application. ",
        "6 2 Social Accounting Matrices. Concept and general issues. A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is a comprehensive and economy-wide database that enables the representation of economic and social information on all the transactions carried out among the agents of a specific economy over a period of time, generally one year. The origins of SAMs are found in the pioneering works of Stone (1947) among others, and subsequent advances in their use as a model for economic analysis (Defourny & Thorbecke, 1984; Pyatt & Round, 1985). A SAM extends the information provided by the Input-Output table by incorporating all economic transactions, using a more disaggregated accounting structure. ( 2 ) This allows closing the circular flow of income and expenditure reflecting the interlinkages among production, trade, demand, income generation and its redistribution between institutional sectors (Pyatt & Round, 1985), providing the opportunity to analyse the distribution of wealth and income. The underlying basis of a SAM is the concept of a circular flow of income represented ( 3 ) in Figure 1. Figure 1. The circular flow (simple version) Source: Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al. (2018b). The elaboration of a SAM requires the use of many statistical sources, mainly the statistical systems of National Accounts, data on trade, as well as socio-economic data related to household income, employment and expenditure that can be obtained from household budget surveys and labour force surveys. With this information, households can be disaggregated using socio-economic characteristics (e.g. income, education, regions, rural- urban division, etc.) to analyse income distribution. The need for further information depends on the disaggregation required for each account depending on the type of analysis to be carried out. ( 2 ) Some problems of I-O frameworks are still present in the SAM framework (i.e. the use of coefficients and fixed prices and no substitution elasticities) (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). ( 3 ) It represents a basic version of the circular flow. It does not take into account transactions between institutions, taxes, savings and investment, among other flows. ",
        "7 A SAM represents a complete snapshot of the economy showing the economic structure and the relationships between economic agents, recording data on all transactions between production activities, factors of production, institutions, and the rest of the world, within a specific country or region under analysis. In this sense, a SAM is a very useful tool to understand the structure of an economy and to be used as a suitable database for economic modelling. As such, it can be used as a database for multisectoral linear models allowing the calculation of multipliers or it can also be used as a database for the application of more complex Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). This makes it possible to analyse how the economy works considering socio-economic issues such as employment, poverty, growth, and income distribution, etc., and to evaluate the impact of different policies interventions. 2.1 Structure of a SAM The SAM is a database represented by a square matrix, organized in a logical framework that provides a visual display of all the transactions that take place between agents in an economy, determining how income is generated and how it is expended. For this purpose, each account is represented by a row that shows the sources of income of each agent and a column, which show the payments made, both in monetary values. Thus, each cell ( i, j ) shows the transaction between account i and j , in which account i receives income from j . Typically, a Social Accounting Matrix has six basic groups of accounts: \u25cf Activities or Commodities (or both, separated) \u25cf Factors of production \u25cf Private Institutions (Households and Corporations/Enterprises) \u25cf Public Institution (Government) \u25cf (Combined) Capital accounts \u25cf Accounts for the Rest of the World. Figure 2 shows the basic structure of a standard SAM ( 4 ); however, the structure of the matrix will be determined by the accounts included in these six basic groups and the disaggregation of these accounts. That along with the geographical scope it represents (national, regional, multi-regional, etc.) will depend on the analysis to be carried out. ( 4 ) For more detail of this general structure see Miller & Blair (2009), Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al. (2018b) or Round (2003). ",

        "9 2.2 Economic agents and accounts 2.2.1 Activities and Commodities The standard structure of the SAM (as shown in figure 2) distinguishes between Activities (that carry out the production of commodities) and Commodities (goods and services). In the Activities, the flows are valued at production costs and in the Commodities, are valued at market prices (including indirect taxes on products and transactions cost). The sum of the values of the Activities represents the domestic production (at production prices). To obtain the supply of Commodities (at purchaser\u2019s prices), net taxes on products, margins and imports must be added. The supply of Commodities is sold domestically (activities, households, government) or exported. Activity accounts represent by columns, the production process including the intermediate consumption of commodities as inputs and the use of factors of production (such as labour, capital, etc.). The sum of the remuneration of factors plus taxes less subsidies on production is the value added by Activities. By rows, Activities cells show the value of commodities produced by each activity (in basic prices). The row sum for an activity is the value of its gross output. By analysing the cells by columns, the Commodity shows the supply of Commodities at purchaser prices, that includes the domestic production by Activities, the imports of rest of the world and payment of taxes less subsidies on products (domestic and imported) to the government (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). The commodity row accounts describe the demand side, composed of intermediate consumption (by Activities) and the final demand consumption by institutional sectors (Household and Government), investment and exports. For each commodity the SAM records the costs associated with marketing and transportation (margins). These transaction costs are associated with the cost of moving goods between producers, markets and national borders, whether for domestic consumption, import or export, and are part of the supply costs of commodities (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018b). 2.2.2 Factors The factors of production are the resources endowments used in the production process (combined with intermediate inputs to produce goods and services). Traditionally, they include capital and labour, as well as other types of factors, such as land or other natural resources . The different types of factors of production and their disaggregation will depend on the aim of the analysis. For example, labour account can be disaggregated by educational level (e.g., skilled and unskilled workers), and capital factor can be disaggregated in accordance with their use (e.g., agricultural/non-agricultural capital). The production factors collect, by row, the income received (wages, rent, etc.) from the activities and the rest of the world. By columns, these incomes are distributed to the owners of the factors of production (Household, Enterprises and Government) and the Rest of the World . 2.2.3 Households The household accounts describe the income and spending of all the individuals in an economy. In a traditionally SAM, households are often aggregated into Representative Household Group (RHG) perhaps categorized by income class, geographical location or demographic characteristics. This categorization assumes that all individual household in an ",
        "10 RHG are, on average, affected in the same manner by a policy shock. This type of information is crucial for the analysis of socio-economic problems (unemployment, income distribution etc.) allowing the modeler to analyse the distributional effects of an economic shock across different household types (Burfisher, 2016). The Household row account receives incomes, which includes income from factors supplied (as owners of labour, capital, land, or natural resources), transfers from Enterprises (distributed profits and direct transfers), from the Government (direct transfers), from the Rest of the World (usually for labour services and remittances) and from other households (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018b). By columns, Household expenditure is detailed, showing the use of household income for consumption of commodities, payment of direct taxes to the government, transfers to other households (domestic and foreign); and households\u2019 savings (or financing need if negative). 2.2.4 Enterprises Enterprises represent the institutional part of the productive sector, so generally they do not consume inputs such as activities. The enterprise accounts collect, by rows, the incomes received related to the ownership of asset (capital, land, or natural resources) and income form transfers from other institutions. The transfer of these revenues is shown in columns, towards other institutions, for example households in the form of dividends, the payment of direct taxes (enterprise tax) or savings. 2.2.5 Government The Government participates as a \u201cproductive activity\u201d through the public sector and the marketed goods and services resulting from their activities are recorded in the respective Activity and Commodities accounts (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). Generally, the Public Administration institutional sector is represented by the Government account for the sector itself, while tax collection is captured through other accounts specific for each tax category (VAT, income, tariffs, etc.). Government income is shown in rows, coming from taxes, transfers received (domestic and foreign) and the remuneration of factors of production (including any government-owned assets). Government expenditure is broken down by column into the consumption demand of goods and services, transfers to other institutions in form of subsidies or benefits (household and enterprises) or to other countries (e.g. debt services payments). The investment-savings cell shows government savings (government surplus) or government deficit (if negative). 2.2.6 Investment-Savings The row of this account records the savings generated by all domestic institutions (households, enterprises, and government) as well as the balance of foreign trade on capital account with the rest of the world. The column shows the capital investment in goods and services, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and changes in stocks. 2.2.7 Rest of the World The foreign sector account shows the economic interaction within the country (or region) analysed and the rest of the world. The foreign sector represents two trade accounts (imports and exports) and can be disaggregated depending on the specific interest of the analysis (e.g., ECOWAS, African Union and Rest of the world). ",
        "11 By rows, the account represents the income received by the rest of the world account that include imports of goods and services (commodities), transfers to abroad from institutions (households, businesses, and government), and the remuneration of factors of production abroad. By column, it shows the Rest of the World expenditures, which are divided into the purchase of goods and services (exports), the payments to domestic factors of production used abroad and transfers recorded from other economies (factor payments, foreign loans and aid, remittances, etc.). The balance, which enters the investment-savings cell, reflects the surplus or deficit with the Rest of the World. Consequently, indicating the capital inflow (in case of negative trade balance) or outflow (positive trade balance) between the Rest of the World and the country at stake. ",
        "12 3 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015 3.1 Home Production for Home Consumption (HPHC) approach The classic Representative Household Group (RHG) includes the household behaviour as consumer of goods and services and as providers of factors of production (and receptor or providers of transfers). However, the dual role of households as producers and consumers is often a typical characteristic of developing countries with economies that have a large proportion of subsistence agriculture. Therefore, there is a need to define and estimate the home production for home consumption (HPHC) within a SAM. This Home Production for Home Consumption (HPHC) approach is introduced in the SAM by assuming that households act as units of production of commodities consuming part or all of their output. Hence, it is necessary to extend the SAM structure by including additional columns and rows for the commodity and activity accounts. Considering the Commodities accounts, additional rows and columns are required to separate the commodities produced by these households for own consumption (HPHC as input or final product) and other marketed commodities (produced both by conventional productive activities and by households). The rows of these commodity accounts show the HPHCs use as intermediate inputs in the productive activities of households and their consumption in final demand of household (RHG). The column summarizes the contribution of the activities of households to each of these goods. HPHC commodities can only be produced by the RHGs that consume those commodities, so each RHG must be a household and an activity. The columns of the household\u2019s activities show the cost structure of their production (combination of inputs-own produced and marketed- and value added), and the rows show the destination of their production as inputs (own-consumption goods or marketed commodities). The taxes, trade and transport costs incurred should be allocated only to the marketed commodity (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). The inclusion of the HPHC approach in a SAM requires more data to distinguish consumer demand between marketed and HPHC commodities and to identify the cost structures used in production. Typically, this will require reconciling data from different sources, especially data on household income and expenditure, labour force and agricultural (production) collected through surveys, and also some additional estimations. 3.2 Structure and estimation of the 2015 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM This study estimates a new SAM for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (base year 2015) based on the standard structure outlined above also including some peculiarities. Thus, the new SAM includes specific accounts for the treatment of HPHC and a high regionalisation differentiated across districts and divided within rural and urban areas. Consequently, this new framework would allow addressing specific issues related for example to production and productive factors for each district, in order to reduce poverty and inequality within and between regions. The regional breakdown in the SAM for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 2015 correspond to the 14 administrative districts of the country (table 1). For each district, the household account is disaggregated into rural and urban zones. Finally, 27 different Representative Household Group (RHG) are detailed in the SAM. Furthermore, 13 of the districts (each one except the city of Abidjan) has a specific agricultural activity producing 10 \u201csubsistence commodities\u201d destined for home consumption, and 17 marketed commodities. The remaining marketed ",
        "13 commodities are produced by the specific activities aggregated at a national level (37 in total). The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM distinguishes between activities and commodities and the HPHC approach mentioned above. The structure and a short version of the SAM is summarised in Table 2. The SAM further contains 96 accounts of production factors. There are 3 types of labour, 1 land factor, 1 livestock factor and 1 capital factor. Labour and land factors are disaggregated across the districts, and labour factors are also separated between rural and urban areas. In summary, the 2015 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM contains 247 accounts: \uf0b7 50 activities (13 household regional agricultural activities and 37 national activities) \uf0b7 64 commodities (10 HPHC and 54 marketed commodities) \uf0b7 96 factors of production (81 labour accounts, 13 land factors and 2 capital factors) \uf0b7 27 households (disaggregated by rural/urban and by districts) \uf0b7 5 tax accounts \uf0b7 1 transaction costs (margins) \uf0b7 3 other institutional accounts: enterprises, government, and the rest of the world \uf0b7 1 savings and investment account.

        "15 3.2.1 Accounts and data sources 3.2.1.1 Activities and Commodities The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015 (and in some cases the 2006 SAM) (Diallo, 2018 ; Fofana, & Diallo, 2015) 5 provides the initial values of rows and columns for commodities and activities, To introduce the HPHC, estimates are required to disaggregate the additional commodity and activity accounts. Households have to be divided between the classic Representative Household Group (RHG) (consuming good and services, providing factors of production and receiving or performing transfers) and the household presented as units of production of commodities. The latter accounts represent the economic behaviour of households as producers of food commodities (agricultural and livestock products) and are disaggregated by districts. It is also necessary to separate accounts for commodities produced by the households for their own consumption and other marketed commodities (produced both by households and by conventional productive activities). The microdata that enables such disaggregation in the SAM are collected from the Household Standard of Living Survey (named ENV 2015) conducted by the National Statistical Institute for 2015 (INS 2015) . This survey provides information on the activities carried out by households, agriculture and livestock, and household consumption, among others, which are essential for the disaggregation mentioned above. The SAM for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is characterized by a high disaggregation of agricultural and food commodities. This is evident since out of the 64 commodities (for own consumption and marketed), 39 are part of the agricultural and food products group. In summary, the 2015 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM includes 50 activities (13 of them are households as producers), producing 10 HPHC commodities and 54 marketed commodities. Table 3 and 4 summarised the breakdown of commodities and activities, and they are also show in detail in Annex 1 Table A1 (Accounts of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Social Accounting Matrix 2015). 3.2.1.2 Households The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015 distinguishes between rural and urban households and disaggregates each one by districts, using information from the 2015 Household Standard of Living Survey conducted by the National Statistical Institute ( Enquete sur le niveu de vie des menages en C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire: ENV 2015) (INS 2015) . As a result, the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015 contains 27 representative household groups (RHG). Such classification will allow for a good analysis of redistributive aspects and the specific impact of different policies. 3.2.1.3 Factors of production The disaggregation of factors of production is very important depending on the objective of the analysis. The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015 separates factors into four broad categories: labour, land, livestock, and capital (Table 5). Outside the use of employment in the HPHC activities, the matrix does not present a disaggregation of employment considering the formal and informal sector due to the limited availability of data, but can be considered as a future modification for further analysis. The SAM classifies the labour factors into three types: skilled, semi- skilled and unskilled labour. The definition of a skilled worker is one with a post- ( 5 ) The SAM for 2015 was developed by Souleymane Sadio Diallo for the Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Economie et des Finances \u2013 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Diallo, 2018). The SAM for 2006 was constructed by Ismael Fofana and Souleymane Sadio Diallo for the International Food Policy Research Institute (Fofana & Diallo, 2015). ",
        "16 primary education and, therefore, a semi-skilled worker is one who has a first-degree education (Fofana and Diallo, 2015). Each labour factor is also regionalized given the 14 districts and further separated into rural and urban areas. This information is disaggregated using the data derived from the ENV 2015. Also, there is one land factor for each district, one account for livestock and other account for capital. 3.2.1.4 Other accounts The C\u00f4te d'Ivoire SAM has one account for the government and five different types of taxes and subsidies: tax and subsidy on production (indtax), taxes on products (vattax), import taxes (imptax), export taxes (exptax) and direct taxes (dirtax). Taxes on production are paid by production activities based on their output. Taxes on products are paid by domestic firms on their intermediate input purchases, and by consumers and investors on their purchases of final goods and services. Direct taxes are paid by enterprises and households (based for example on income earned from wages and rents). The transaction cost account includes the cost associated with marketing and transportation. The margins include the costs of trade and transport from moving goods between producers, markets and/or national borders, either for domestic, import or export trade. There is one account for savings and investment that includes by row the domestic private savings by enterprises and households and the fiscal surplus (or deficit) for the government. By columns, it includes the combination of gross fixed capital formation (investment on commodities as machinery, vehicles, and equipment) and change in stocks. The description and codification of all accounts is presented in the Annex 1, Table A1. ",

Furthermore, the 2015 Household Standard of Living Survey conducted by the National Statistical Institute ( Enquete sur le niveu de vie des menages en C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) was used to carry out the aforementioned disaggregation (INS, 2015) . The main objective of the Household Living Standards Survey is to collect information to improve the planning and evaluation of economic and social policies in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. To this end, it provides basic data on the standard of living and living conditions of households and it includes detailed information on health, education, employment, farming, income- generating activity, housing expenditures, activities, transport, etc. The ENV (2015) data are nationally representative. The survey has a sample size of 12,900 households with a response rate of 99.9%, and the data was collected between 23 rd January and 25 th March 2015. The data collected is representative of the 33 regions (31 regions plus the city of Abidjan and the Autonomous District of Yamoussoukro) classified in the 14 districts and separated into both urban and rural areas. Regarding the regions, it was necessary to distinguish between the city of Abidjan which has a relatively important economic weight and the rest of the districts. Furthermore, the distinction between urban and rural areas was necessary because of the differences in average consumption, employment, and income. For these reasons, the 2015 national SAM for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is disaggregated into 14 districts that guarantee the representativeness of the 33 regions. The district disaggregation has been applied to households (as productive units (activities) and as institutional units), and for labour and land factors (see table 1). The microdata provided by the survey are necessary to disaggregate the sub-accounts specified in this SAM. Since the construction of the SAM uses many different sources, it was also necessary to apply techniques to reconcile and balance the data. To this end, the RAS and the Cross Entropy methods are useful to balance a matrix when there is not enough information but macroeconomic targets or targets for specific accounts and cells or sub- matrices are available (McDougall, 1999; Robinson et al., 2001). The RAS procedure, also knows as a \u201cbiproportional\u201d matrix balancing technique, is based on a process of iterations. These iterations occur until the balance between the rows and columns is reached (Bacharach, 1970). The cross-entropy (CE) is a method that minimizes the distances between the priors and the resulting value, subject to the row and column sum restrictions. The CE approach represents an extension of the standard RAS method and provides a flexible method for estimating a SAM when dealing with scattered and inconsistent data (Robinson, et al., 1998). ",
        "20 In the construction of this matrix, the RAS method (or the generalized version named GRAS) has been applied whenever it has been necessary to balance the matrix. More specifically, the RAS technique is used to reconcile the data in a matrix with certain previously defined row and column values. Hence, it is based on iteratively adjusting the initial matrix A 0 , with its row sums (u 0 ) and column sums (v 0 ), in order to generate a new matrix A 1 satisfying the defined target of certain row sums (u 1 ) and column sums (v 1 ). Using this technique, the obtained matrix differs as little as possible from the previous matrix. In this solution, the zero-value entries keep their zero values and the positive entries keep their positives values. The generalized alternative (GRAS) emerged in order to have the possibility of updating a given matrix with negative entries (Junius & Oosterhaven, 2003; Umed et al., 2013; Miller & Blair, 2009). ",
        "21 4 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 2015 analysis using SAM data 4.1 Economy structure analysis A SAM provides the macroeconomic data that allows the description of the economic structure of a country. It also presents the microeconomic data that describes a nation\u2019s economic activity in detail. The data analysis of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM for the year 2015 provides a snapshot of the characteristics of the Ivorian economy. The macroeconomic analysis shows that domestic absorption represents 101.8% of the GDP and the foreign sector shows that exports represent 40.2% and imports 42% of the GDP (Figure 3). Regarding the composition of domestic absorption, private household consumption represents 67.4%, followed by investment representing 19.7% and government expenditure 12.9% (Figure 4). Figure 3. Domestic absorption, imports, and exports as % of the GDP. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 2015. Source: Own elaboration with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015. Figure 4. Domestic absorption composition. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 2015. Source: Own elaboration with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015. By analysing the households' consumption of commodities, the primary sector and food industry stand out with 50.8% of expenditure. The services sector is the second most important with 25.8% of household consumption (Figure 5). Rice, yam, and plantain (within 40.2% 42.0% 101.8% Exports Imports Domestic absortion 67.4% 12.9% 19.7% Private consumption Government consumption Investment ",
        "22 agriculture) and meat and fish, grain milling, oilseed, dairy, and beverages (within the food industry sector) are the most demanded products by households. For the spending on services, 28% represent the postal and telecommunications services and 20% the transport services. The expenditure in the manufacturing commodities represents 16.4% destined mainly for chemicals (5%) and machinery and equipment (3.8%). Finally, 5.7% of household expenditure is allocated to petroleum products. Figure 5. Household consumption pattern. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 2015. Source: Own elaboration with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015. The total values of household consumption on commodities are similarly distributed between rural and urban households (48.4% and 51.6% respectively). The in-depth analysis of household consumption patterns shows certain non-significant differences in consumption by group of commodities, for rural and urban regions, as well as across each district. This can be seen in the Figure 6 that shows the distribution of household consumption of group of commodities, considering the consumption patterns of households classified into rural and urban areas and also by districts. It represents the proportion that each commodity or group of commodities represents in the consumption of each group. Thus, rural households have a slightly higher consumption of primary sector and food industry commodities, while urban households also consume slightly more manufactured goods, including textiles and clothing, and petroleum and mining products. These minor differences are also reflected in the analysis of the distribution of commodities consumption across districts. Considering that Abidjan is the main city of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Yamoussoukro is the capital, the consumption patterns that stands out for urban areas is clearly visible for both autonomous districts. In the urban area, the city of Abidjan predominates, responsible for 26.9% of consumption. In the other districts, in addition to the primary sector and the food industry, the use of transport and communication services stands out. In addition, rural households consume their own produced commodities, highlighting the consumption of yam (23.3%), rice (16.3%) and cassava (12.8%).

After explaining the household consumption pattern, it is important to explain the commodities composition of exports and imports. In the case of exports, the primary sector and food industry represent the 53.20%, of which 33.76% refers to cocoa exports (including cocoa and cocoa products). Then, crude oil and petroleum represent 20.83%, and manufactured products 19.41% (of which 6.35% refers to machinery and other equipment). For imports, the manufacturing sectors stand out with 51.22%, due to imports of machinery and equipment (24%) and chemicals (11.56%) (Figure 7). Figure 7. Exports and imports composition.

Analysing employment, unskilled labour represents almost half of the employment (46.67%), mainly focused on the primary sector and services. Considering both semi-skilled and skilled labour, their representation in the primary sector is low, as opposed to services and to some extent to manufacturing.

Continuing with the analysis of the distribution of value added by activities (Figure 8), services stand out representing 45.86%, followed by home production. Households as activities (focus on agricultural activities) represent 25.56% of the value added, which includes all the land and livestock factor, 25.9% of labour factors and 5.3% of capital factors. In the case of services, capital and labour factor are particularly important with 52.2% and 48.7% respectively. Figure 8. Distribution of factors and Value Added by aggregate activities.

According to the information provided in the SAM, 28.6% of the income received from compensation to labour and 34.8% of the income received form compensation to capital corresponds to households from Abidjan. Hence, land and livestock factor income are concentrated for the districts Bas-Sassandra, Lacs and Sassandra-Marahou\u00e9. Focusing the analysis on each district, capital represented more than 50% of the incomes in Autonomous district of Yamoussoukro and more than 35% for Abidjan, Lagunes and Savanes. The transfers received by the government are more concentrated in Dengu\u00e9l\u00e9 (representing 14.3% of its income). Mora than 80% of the income received by Bas-Sassandra and Zanzan come from labour and land factors. Both labour and land are key factors in income in the rural zones, representing 72% of the incomes.

This methodology enables to analyse the linkages between sectors through the calculation of multipliers, which is useful for studying the impact of different policies (Round, 2003b). In this section t he output, value added, and employment multipliers are calculated. A brief explanation of the calculation of the three multipliers is included in Annex 2. 4.2.1 Multipliers The analysis of the multiplier effect shows those commodities with capacity to generate output, employment and value added above average, and therefore, identifies which ones are suitable to be promoted through policies. The analysis of multipliers is a useful tool for ex-ante policy evaluation, however, the exact results obtained for each multiplier should be taken with some caution due to some limiting assumptions of the SAM linear models (Mainar- ",
        "26 Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). These limitations are mainly related to the excess capacity in all sectors and unemployed factors of production (no supply constraints) and fixed prices (not taking substitutions effects into account) (Miller & Blair, 2009; Round, 2003b). The values of the multipliers calculated for the Ivoirian economy in 2015 are presented in Tables 8 and 9. The cells are shaded to compare those below or above the average. Each value of the output multiplier shows the increase in gross output in sectors, due to one-unit exogenous injection into the final demand of a commodity (i.e. an exogenous increase in exports demand). As for example, the output multiplier of yam indicates that a one-unit increase in exogenous demand in yam leads to 2.65 of output increase in the economy. Likewise, the value added multiplier indicates the new value added created by the additional production in responses to an exogenous shock in demand. Finally, the values of the employment multipliers measure the increment in the number of jobs generated by the exogenous increase in demand. Taking the multipliers of Table 8 into account, the primary sector group showed a higher backward income generation capacity than the economy average. Within agriculture, the calculation of the output multiplier highlights the importance of several products, with major values for forestry (2.98), plantain (2.73), cassava (2.69), yam (2.65), hevea (2.65) and maize (2.62). On the other hand, rice, fishing, and other oilseeds have a weaker impact on the economy, both in production, value added and employment. Regarding the employment multiplier, the values are clearly above average for most primary sector products, with highest impact for plantain, cotton, maize, cashew, and yam. Analysing this group of commodities, the distribution of employment generated by the multiplier is concentrated with over 70% in \u201c unskilled workers\u201d , while the impact on \u201c semi-skilled workers \u201d represents between 18% and 30% and the impact on \u201c skilled workers \u201d is weak. Moreover, the jobs generated through the multiplier are predominantly in rural areas of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, representing about 70% of the impact. For some commodities, the employment multiplier impact predominates in specific regions, as in the case of maize and cotton, where 34% of the multiplier effect is distributed in Savanes. For example, the case of Yam where the impact on employment is concentrated in Sassandra-Marahou\u00e9 (37% of the multiplier effect), the case for plantain and fruits predominated in Montagnes (37% and 28%), or the case of cashew in Zanzan (34%). Following on with the multiplier analysis, it shows that many of the commodities classified under the food industry sector, such as meat and fish, grain milling, dairy, beverages and tobacco have very low multiplier values in output, value added and employment. Within this group, only cocoa products and oilseed have an output and value added multipliers above average. For the food industry sector, the employment multiplier has very low values and the jobs generated by an exogenous impact of demand are distributed similar to the agriculture group but decreasing the impact on \u201c unskilled workers\u201d and slightly increasing the impact on \u201c skill workers \u201d. The employment multiplier effects within this group of products are similarly distributed between rural and urban areas. However, for cocoa and grain milling the impact of the jobs generated in the rural region is slightly higher. ",

Shaded cells: value greater than the average Focusing on Table 9, the results indicate that among the manufactured and utilities sectors, only wood products and furniture and other manufacturing stand out in terms of job creation. Even though some products show output multipliers above the average, they do not generate a high value added multiplier (for example rubber and plastic products, wood products and utilities). The crude oil and mining sector show low values for the three multipliers, with only other mining having a slightly above average value added multiplier. The construction has output multiplier above the average and employment and value added multipliers a slightly above average. In the case of services, they show above-average values in terms of output, value added and employment for trade, repair services, accommodation and food services, education and health and social work. Other commodities within this group have an output multiplier above the global average, but significantly lower in terms of employment (such as postal and telecommunications services, real estate, and public administration). ",
        "28 For those that stand out with higher employment multipliers, the analysis of the distribution of their impact shows that, although unskilled workers predominate, services also distribute their impact towards semi-skilled workers (approx. 30%) and skill workers (approx. 8%). Moreover, the distribution is higher for urban regions, and is particularly more concentrated in Abidjan. Table 9.

        "29 5 Conclusions This report presents a detailed C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM for 2015 expanded to include district-level households, factors of production and agricultural production. It explains its accounts and the main data sources for its construction. In summary, the new C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015 presented in this report contains 247 accounts: 50 activities (13 for household as producers), producing 54 marketed commodities and 10 \u2019home-production for home-consumption (HPHC) commodities\u2019. It considers 3 type of labour (skilled, unskilled, and semi-skilled) in 14 districts and disaggregated in rural and urban (81 labour accounts), 1 type of land for each district (13 land factor accounts) and 1 livestock factor and 1 capital factor. Regarding households, each of the 13 districts is divided in urban and rural areas, and there is one urban account for the city of Abidjan (27 households\u2019 accounts). The disaggregation across C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire's districts is very important to promote policies focused on equality and development in the country. Finally, there is one account for margins, one corresponding to enterprises, other for the government, the rest of the world, and one for savings and investment. In Annex 1, Table A1 shows all accounts considered in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire SAM 2015. The SAM can be freely downloaded from DataM portal, as explained in the Annex 3. For C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, there is a 2006 and a 2015 SAM, which have a lower level of disaggregation and fewer account types than the one built in this report (Diallo, 2018 ; Fofana, & Diallo, 2015). The disaggregation and particularities of this new SAM make it a novel database suitable for future research work with a focus on agriculture and food security. The main objective is to have an appropriate database that can be used for the analysis of policies and incentives to improve the social and economic conditions of the country. Previous studies in developing countries used SAMs as databases to analyse policies and impacts related to food security, trade, agricultural development, among others (Boulanger et al., 2018; 2019; Mainar-Casup\u00e9 et al., 2020; Nechifor et al., 2021; Osman et al. 2021;). The output, value added, and employment multipliers are calculated in this report to showcase the usefulness of the SAM for agricultural and development policies. Although their interpretation should be taken with caution due to the limitations of the methodology, they are useful for an initial impact analysis (Mainar et al., 2020). To this end, the results obtained show the significance of the primary sector, which has a higher impact on C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's economy, both in terms of output generation, value added and job creation. Therefore, these sectors would be the most suitable to be promoted through specific policies. At the same time, the SAM documented in this report is expected to be used in other ex-ante policy evaluations notably through the application of country-level CGE models. ",

        "39 Annex 2. The linear SAM model and multipliers The linear SAM models are a simple way to analyse the information provided by a SAM database regarding the structure of an economy and the linkages within its account. This type of analysis is useful to study the impact of different policies through the calculation of multipliers. The starting point is the Leontief's equilibrium equation \ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc8f = \ud835\udc68 \ud835\udc8f \ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc8f + \ud835\udc99 ( 6 ), applied to the case of a SAM obtaining the SAM Leontief inverse (Pyatt & Round, 1985). The standard representation is as follows: \ud835\udc40 = (\ud835\udc3c \u2212 A) (cid:2879)(cid:2869) , where the matrix \ud835\udc34 is the coefficient matrix (calculating dividing each element of the SAM by the total of their corresponding column), and each element \ud835\udc5a (cid:3036)(cid:3037) in \ud835\udc40 shows the output requirements of account \ud835\udc56 to increase the final demand of account \ud835\udc57 by one unit (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). This matrix is used as a tool to evaluate the capacity of each economic sector to generate output and employment in the rest of the economy through the analysis of multipliers. Output multiplier The sum of the multiplier values of \ud835\udc74 (cid:3028) (corresponding to the commodities columns and the rows of productive activities of \ud835\udc40 ), shows the output multiplier. This multiplier indicates the final increase in gross output of all production activities generated due to a unitary exogenous shock in exogenous values for the corresponding commodity. A high value of this multiplier indicates an account with a large backward income expansion influence on the rest of the economy, given its interdependence with other sectors (Pulido & Fontela, 1993). Employment multiplier The employment multiplier measures the impact in the number of jobs that would be generated by an exogenous shock in final demand. For its calculation it is necessary to have the vector of employment \ud835\udc86 , which represents the ratios between the number of jobs and the output of each activity (per million of output value) . The elements of \ud835\udc86 in diagonal form the employment matrix \ud835\udc6c , that is multiplied by the part of the multiplier matrix ( \ud835\udc74 (cid:3028) ) with rows corresponding to the productive accounts and the columns corresponding to commodities. The employment multiplier is defined as: \ud835\udc74 \ud835\udc86 = \ud835\udc6c \u00d7 \ud835\udc74 \ud835\udc82 , of which element \ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8b is the increment in the number of jobs in sector \ud835\udc56 when there is a unit exogenous injection into the endogenous final demand account of \ud835\udc57 . The sum of the columns in the matrix shows the global effect on employment produced by the exogenous increase in demand (number of jobs per million of additional output from each activity (Mainar-Causap\u00e9 et al., 2018a). Due to the model assumptions mentioned above, the results should not be interpreted as an accurate forecast of job creation resulting from exogenous shocks. Furthermore, the results do not take into account social variables, such as the quality of employment. However, the results can be useful as an indicator of the commodities in the economy with the greatest potential for employment generation. Value added multiplier The value added multiplier relates the new value added created in each sector by the additional production in response to an exogenous shock in demand (Miller & Blair, 2009). Similar to the calculation of the employment multiplier, a value added vector can be used to calculate the value added multiplier. The vector \ud835\udc97 contains the ratios between the value added and the output of each activity. ( 6 ) Assuming Leontief technologies (i.e. with fixed prices and no substitution elasticities), the result should be taken with caution. ",
