        "Editorial Extracts from the speech delivered by the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Marin, at the conference 'People and technology: Investment in training for the future of Europe' \u2014 London, 25 and 26 November 1986 I wish to underline the importance of human resources as a key factor for the success of the internal market and, more generally, for the economic and social development of the Community. 'Investing in the people of tomorrow' \u2014 the importance of this objective is ac knowledged everywhere but especially by the Community which, at a meeting held in Berlin four years ago, began to consider the implications of the new technologies from the point of employ ment, qualifications and training and to deliberate on the definition of a Commu nity strategy, which has since found ex pression chiefly in the launching of the Eurotecnet programme. The time has now come to review the situation and to decide what lines the Community action, in which each of us will have an important part to play, should take. The problem posed by the skills of the labour force is certainly not new. However, the increasing concern felt as regards this problem arises from the fact that the chronic labour surpluses do not seem destined to last, if only for demographic reasons. The number of young people arriving on the employment market is going to fall and there is every indication that the number of women In employment has reached its peak. Consequently, employers may once again be faced with the paradoxical situ ation where they will be obliged to be less selective in their recruitment and, rather than seek the most highly skilled, will have to recruit less qualified people. Leaving aside this medium-term an alysis, which, given the high levels of unemployment in the Community at the present time, may appear rather con tradictory, the fact Is that a shortage of skilled and highly-skilled labour is al ready discernible in certain occupations and in certain regions. The advent of the new technologies has heightened the concern felt at these disparities In skills. Technological change and the spread of the new technologies in both the industrial and service sectors have significantly altered quality require ments. It is becoming increasingly clear that skilled labour is an absolute necessity if full economic advantage is to be taken of technological innovation. Furthermore, the technological changes which occur at the workplace are accompanied by the sometimes bru tal disappearance of unskilled jobs or of jobs for which the new technologies now require occupational skills which those adults who began working several years ago do not possess. The need to adapt to a whole range of structural changes \u2014 Including the new technologies \u2014 and the uncertainty which reigns as regards the changes to come call for a degree of flexibility on the labour market such as to enable firms to implement a continuous strat egy of adjustment. Outside the firm, i.e. the external la bour market, flexibility can be increased if workers possess skills enabling them to move from one job to another in re sponse to changes in qualitative labour requirements. Admittedly, It is not easy to state precisely what those skills should be or by what means an initial and continuous training policy leading to such skills can be implemented. Technological change does not have the same profile everywhere in that the responses to the demand for skills which it creates are not identical, being conditioned by the industrial and eco nomic circumstances of the firms and branches concerned. However, It is clear that human re sources are a decisive factor in the com petitiveness and productivity of under takings. We can state quite unequivocally that a highly-skilled working population can enhance the economic results of firms and that when seen from this angle, the ability of firms to mobilize and harness the full potential of human re sources is the principal requirement for economic performance and the effective use of material investments. However, the harnessing of such potential cannot be achieved without as signing a central role to training policies. This is true both for initial training designed to ensure the social and pro fessional integration of young people in skilled jobs and for in-service training designed to accompany the general de velopment of job profiles and ensure the acquisition of know-how in the new pro duction technologies. However, three basic points have to be stressed as regards the role of voca tional training in connection with the new technologies: (i) firstly, training should not be devel oped merely for its own sake. More precisely, it must be treated as a de cisive factor of modernization and as a primary means of ensuring the effi ciency, mobility and qualification of employees throughout their working lives; (ii) secondly, the need for greater and more frequent recourse to training schemes must be empasized both from the point of view of firms' poli cies and from that of the aspirations and opportunities open to the indi vidual employee; (iii) lastly, the development of training as an investment cannot take place without far-reaching changes if not a total reshaping of training methods and structures. It entails the intro duction of new formulas for collabor ation and partnerships between the users. In this context, I should like to stress the importance of the participation of workers and their representatives in such initial and continuous training poli cies. Without the motivation of the work force, all efforts in the field of continuous training for employees will be futile. Such motivation implies that their role as an active partner must be recog nized both before, during and after train ing initiatives. It also requires that train ing should not be limited merely to the specific, circumstancial and short-term needs of firms. Lastly, it demands that ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE measures be taken to ensure that the skills acquired are also recognized out side the firm so as to ensure occupa tional mobility. Yet it is clear that the rapid adapta tion of workers to structural changes in firms will be all the more effective if it forms part of the firms' internal develop ment strategies. Training must therefore be seen as a non-material investment closely inter linked with the planned management of all factors of production. ",

        "Long-term unemployment recent trends and developments Copyright REA/D dier Maillac In December 1984, the Council of Ministers agreed a resolution on action to combat long-term unem ployment. Nearly two years later, about 40% of all people registered as unemployed have been without a job for at least 12 months and a growing proportion have been out of work for two years or more. Background Between October 1980 and October 1984, the proportion of unemployed workers in the Community (excluding Greece) who had been registered as un employed for 12 months or more rose from about 25% to nearly 40% (See Table 1). Numbers registered for at least one year more than trebled in the case of young people and were about 2 1 / 2 times greater for people aged 25 and over. Although the proportion of young people in the total of all unemployed people fell from 43% to 40%, their pro portion in the total of those registered for more than one year rose from 16% to 30%. Among those aged 25 and over this latter proportion rose from 32% to 45%. Concern over the growing problem of long-term unemployment led the Commission of the European Communi ties to examine the situation in detail and present a series of proposals for positive action by Member States, the Social Partners and the Commission in a Communication to the Council on 'Action to combat long-term unemploy ment'. 1 In December 1984, the Council agreed a resolution 2 setting out a series of measures based on the Commis sion's proposals. In broad terms, these measures consisted of a set of actions to prevent people from becoming long- term unemployed in this first place, together with actions to help reintegrate into the labour market those who had al ready been without a job for 12 months or more. Stress was also laid on the need to organize the national employ ment services in such a way as to be able to identify and follow up people at COM (84) 484 final of 14 September 1984. OJ C 2/3 of 4 January 1985. ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE risk of becoming long-term unem ployed. The Commission was asked to support Member States in their actions, including through the use of the Euro pean Social Fund, and to research, monitor and disseminate information about new developments. Current situation Two years after the agreement of that resolution, about 40% of unem ployed people throughout the Commu nity have been unemployed for more than one year and nearly half of these for more than two years. Worst affected in general have been those aged over 55 and those under 25: however no age group is unaffected by the problem and the available statistics show that an in creasing proportion of unemployed adults in the 25\u201444 age have been out of work for 12 months or more. Whilst it is not possible to make direct compari sons between Member States given dif ferences of both definition and method of data collection, the latest figures avail able from Eurostat' and the OECD indi cate that the overall trend is towards an increase in long-term unemployment. Denmark is the only Member State where the proportion of unemployed workers who have been out of work for one year or more is now smaller than in 1980. Provisional figures up to April 1986 show a recent slight decrease in long-term unemployment in the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Neth erlands and the United Kingdom (See Table 2). However, with the exceptions of Luxembourg and Denmark, the pro portion of unemployed workers regis tered as unemployed for 12 months or more still ranges from 30% to, in most Member States well over 40%. Characteristics of long-term unemployed people It would be misleading to generalize about the characteristics of a group of the population which has been iden tified solely by the lack of a job for a stated period. The individuals who make up that group may have been affected by a wide variety of labour market disad vantages such as age, geographical lo cation, interrupted unemployment his tory, level of qualifications, criminal re cord or health problems, which singly or in combination have led to prolonged unemployment. Recent research under taken by the European Commission and by the OECD indicates, however, that those worst affected by long-term un employment have a number of charac teristics in common: (i) a lack of basic skills, including liter acy, numeracy, life skills and basic technological skills; (ii) difficulties in entering training pro grammes geared to specific labour market needs, which presuppose a certain level of experience or qualifi cations; (iii) demotivation and loss of skills fol lowing a lengthy period outside the labour market; (iv) the risk of being further marginalized in having access only to pro grammes specifically set up for long-term unemployed people; (v) entry to a cycle of deprivation and poverty, particularly in countries where the level of State support diminishes significantly after a cer tain period \u2014 usually about 12 months \u2014 when the unemployed person's entitlement to insurance- based benefit expires. Community support for initiatives Direct Community support for initia tives to help long-term unemployed people is given through the European Social Fund and the programme of ac tion to combat poverty. The guidelines for the European So cial Fund provide that one of the areas in which fund assistance will be concen trated is operations to promote unem ployment in 'areas of high and long-term unemployment drawn up with reference to unemployment rates and to gross domestic product'. Priority for funds for recruitment aids is limited, for budgetary reasons, to absolute priority regions \u2014 Greece, the Mezzogiorno, French Over seas Territories, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Portugal and the re gions of Andaluc\u00eda, the Canary Islands, Castilla-Leon, Castilla La Mancha, Gali cia, Murcia and the towns of Ceuta and Mellilla in Spain. As regards funds to support vocational training, priority op erations for adults aged over 25 include 'the vocational training of the long-term unemployed geared to their needs and including motivation and guidance and offering substantial prospects of unem ployment'. These operations are limited to areas of high and long-term unem ployment and/or industrial and sectoral restructuring. No distinction in terms of duration of unemployment is made in the case of priority areas for young peo ple aged under 25. It is likely, however, that in this and other areas, a large pro portion of expenditure under the Euro pean Social Fund has been to support activities which are concerned at least in part with long-term unemployed people. Overall funding allocated for training in itiatives to help long-term unemployed people has increased from 32.7 mECU in 1985 to 151 mECU in 1986, reflecting the increase in the scale of the problem and the corresponding increase in mea sures to tackle long-term unemployment in Member States. Long-term unemployed people were also identified as a priority group in the programme of Community action to combat poverty. Whilst recognizing the existence of community and national in itiatives in favour of this group, it was felt that the new action programme could, in parallel with existing measures, address the problem of those in danger of expe riencing poverty in the course of a pro tracted period of unemployment. A range of projects is being supported throughout the Community for the four year duration of this programme. From a total budget of 23 mECU, approximately 3 mECU has been committed for pro- Eurostat figures for all 12 Member Slates at October 1985, based on data from the labour sample survey, will be published in the 1987 vo lume of Eurostat's annual publication 'Employ ment and unemployment'. 10 ",
        "LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT jects specifically targetted at long-term unemployed people. Action taken by Member States At the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s the increase in the numbers of unemployed people resulting from the effects of the recession led to the development, by national gouvern- ments, of a variety of special employ ment and training measures, many of which were targetted at young people entering the labour market. As high le vels of unemployment persisted, the problem of long-term unemployment emerged as a further priority area for ac tion which gave rise to a range of new or adapted initiatives by Member States. Recent research has shown that mea sures currently taken by national gouv- ernments throughout the Community can be divided into the following broad categories: (i) specially targetted placement and counselling activities, usually carried out by the employment services, de signed to ensure increased atten tion to the needs of long-term unem ployed people; (ii) subsidies, of different forms, to the employer or, as in the case of the UK, to the individual, designed to promote the employment of long- term unemployed people; (iii) training or re-training programmes, either freestanding or linked to other employment measures: many of these aim primarily to improve basic skills, job search techniques, etc.; (iv) direct job creation measures gen erally of limited duration (with the exception of the Belgian Troisi\u00e8me Circuit de Travail) and involving work of public utility, which aim to reaccustom the individual to a work ing environment and facilitate reintegration into the labour market; (v) other measures including the provi sion of voluntary activities, adult education activities, etc. In addition to these specifically tar getted measures, long-term unem ployed people also benefit from other general employment measures, particu larly those designed to encourage un employed people to set up in business. For example, in the UK, long-term unem ployed people make up about 25% of all participants in the Enterprise allowance scheme whilst, in Ireland, nearly a third of participants in a similar scheme have previously been without a job for 12 months or more. Issues for the future Despite the stated commitment by the Community to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment, an increasing proportion of unemployed workers risk prolonged periods without a job. This raises questions about both the scale of the Community's response to the prob lem and also about the effectiveness of the measures adopted to reintegrate long-term unemployed people into the labour market and to prevent people from becoming long-term unemployed in the first place. A particularly disturb ing trend is the increase in the number of people who have been out of work for two years or more \u2014 the very long-term unemployed (Table 3), whose particular characteristics and needs have not yet been identified but for whom traditional employment and training measures are likely to be inappropriate. The 1984 Council Resolution to combat long-term unemployment re quested the European Commission to review progress in meeting the objec tives set out in that resolution every two years. The review will be presented in the form of a Communication to the Council in early 1987 and based on in formation obtained from Member States through questionnaires and on the find ings of recent reports undertaken by the Commission and other organizations with an interest in policy on long-term unemployment. The report will seek to address the issues outlined above and to present proposals for further action to tackle the problem. 11 ",

        "Specific measures taken under the Community policy relating to the employment market Exchanges of officials from the national employment services: an instrument for cooperation and arriving at a common policy in matters of employment The accomplishment of the in ternal market by 1992 is one of the Community's priority objectives. It implies not only the free unimpeded movement of goods, capital and services, but also the totally unres tricted movement of persons, i. e. of the very executors of the economic and social progress of the Commu nity. In turn, to be effective, the free movement of persons requires more intensive integration of the Community employment market. In a recent interview, a journalist put the following question to the President of the Commission con cerning the implications of the gradual accomplishment of the 'open market' by the end of 1992: 'If we take a leap forward to 1993, what will have changed, in practical terms, in the daily lives of European citizens?' The reply from Mr Delors was: 'A great deal! Firstly, the free movement of persons: the possibil ity for a student to enrol at any Eu ropean university or for anyone in a clerical, manual or managerial oc cupation to try his luck on the en tire European employment market.' Beginning with this edition, So cial Europe will devote a series of three articles to a number of spe cific measures designed to further the integration of the European em ployment market. The article in this edition deals with cooperation be tween the national administrative departments responsible for em ployment through exchanges be tween officials of the national em ployment services. Social Europe will then also devote an article to 'Sedoc' (European system for the international clearing of vacancies and applications for employment) and initiatives under way with a view to achieving the full integra tion of the frontier employment markets. From the point of view of rules and regulations, a great deal has been done to encourage the integration of the national employment markets. Quite considerable achievements have al ready been made. The Community measures which have such integration ' as their immediate aim or which contri bute indirectly to attaining this goal are many and varied. Indeed, the freedom of movement of workers has been virtually complete for nearly 15 years while the social security of migrant workers has been assured for even longer. At the same time, the Court of Justice monitors compliance with Community rules and defends these fundamental workers' rights: a body of case law already exists in this field. For its part, the Social Fund pro motes the geographical and occupa tional mobility of workers by encourag ing vocational training and readaptation within their own country and beyond national borders. The Community policies on employ ment and vocational training can rely on quite an extensive range of legal instru ments (directives, resolutions, deci sions, etc.) laying down obligations and in some cases even implementing in struments and procedures. These too help to establish a solid and effective legislative and operational groundwork for the Community policy on the integra tion of the employment market. However, despite the achievements made, the Community provisions alone are not enough. Their legal effectiveness is clearly unquestionable but their im pact on real everyday life \u2014 which is what really concerns the European cit izen \u2014 depends basically en the ar rangements for implementing Commu nity law, i.e. on the actual commitment of the national authorities. This is why, in addition to adopting rules, the Community is taking action to encourage this difficult task of integra tion by another route: that of coopera tion between the Member States. Both routes are necessary and mutually com plementary. Progress along one route necessarily requires progress along the other. Admittedly, such cooperation al ready exists but it should be developed by means of continuous efforts at co ordination and relentless encourage ment to pursue the common objectives already fixed and clearly defined in the Community acts. Such cooperation finds effective practical expression in regular ex changes between officials of the national employment departments and the pooling of acquired know-how and experience. These types of exchanges result in a sort of interp\u00e9n\u00e9tration of the national administrative bodies allowing a comparison to be made of working methods, approaches to certain prob lems, the solutions chosen, the instru ments used, the structures set up and the results obtained. The whole spec trum of matters connected with the pol icy relating to the employment market and its management can therefore be the subject of dialogue, study, compar ison and, lastly, Community coopera tion. Exchanges In adopting the Regulation on the free movement of workers in 1968, the Council instructed the Commission to organize contacts between the national employment departments also by means of exchanges between officials and specialized staff training pro grammes (Article 23 of Regulation 1612/68). In its 1980 resolution on the objec tives of the Community policy on the employment market, the Council stated, in defining the measures to be taken, that Community action must be directed at developing effective cooperation be tween the national public employment departments on practical issues such as staff training, the introduction of data- processing techniques in the public em ployment services and the function of vocational guidance. 13 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE On the basis of these provisions, the Commission has been coordinating and financing exchanges between officials of the employment services of the Member States for 13 years. In 1986, some 350 000 ECU was ex pended on such activities, 275 officials took part in exchanges. The exchanges took the form either of 1 \u20142 month traineeships or of visits and meetings lasting only a few days by officials of the central employment de partment or the recruitment services for frontier regions or officials specialized in the application of the Sedoc system. While visits or meetings are a useful means of solving specific or incidental problems directly connected with the transfrontier or international clearance of vacancies and applications for employ ment, the aims of traineeship are more general, relating to information, coopera tion and even \u2014 from 1987 onwards \u2014 the study of subjects relating to employ ment and the labour market which are of concern to all the Member States. Traineeships Thousands of civil servants, of all le vels of responsibility, have taken part enthusiastically and profitably in these traineeships since they first began in 1973. Their commitment, competence and open-minded attitude to the outside world have resulted in the growth of a European network of contacts and rela tions which has proved particularly beneficial to collaboration between the national administrative departments re sponsible for employment. More specifically, the study of a given subject during a period as trainee combined with the experience of living and working in an administrative depart ment of another Member State is not only enriching from the professional and human point of view for the trainee but is also fruitful for the national administra tion from which he/she came since the study, which necessarily culminates in a report, in most cases triggers off a pro cess of reflection in the administrative department of origin which may some times lead to useful conclusions as re gards both the planning of employment policy and the improvement of struc tures in the employment services. Over the years, these traineeships have therefore shown themselves to be ex tremely valuable not only as an addi tional instrument of training for the offi cials of the employment services but also and above all as a way of enhan cing mutual acquaintance with and rap prochement between the national ad ministrative departments and their re spective systems for managing the em ployment market. The very profitable nature of the ex perience gained in this field has there fore prompted the Commission and the Working Party on Exchanges \u2014 within which a continuous and constructive dialogue has been established between the Member States \u2014 to draw up new guidelines for exploiting the enormous potential offered by exchanges in two areas: (i) technical cooperation between the employment departments of two or more Member States; (ii) the study of subjects of interest to all the Member States so as to reach conclusions useful to the implementation of new national or Community measures in the em ployment field. These new guidelines \u2014 the text of which is attached \u2014 were formally adopted by the Director-General of Em ployment of the Member States in meet ing in Brussels on 26 and 27 November 1986. Technical cooperation The idea of technical cooperation through exchanges is by no means new but the need for technical cooperation in the employment field is certainly greater now, i.e. following the accession of Greece in 1981 and of Spain and Portu gal in 1986. There is an even greater di versity of social legislation and the dis parity as regards the development of the very structures of the employment ser vices is more pronounced in the Com munity of Twelve than it was in the Com munity of Nine. In 1986, the Commission used ex changes between specialized staff in or der to implement a programme of tech nical cooperation in favour of Portugal in matters relating to the management of the employment market. At the request of the Instituto do Emprego e Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Profissional, which is empowered by the Portuguese Ministry of Employment to organize the employment services, the Commission coordinated and financed, in the form of exchanges of experts, a technical cooperation programme be tween Belgium and France on the one hand and Portugal on the other on mat ters suchas: (i) the structure of placement services; (ii) the management of the Portuguese Employment Centre; (iii) employment surveys and contacts with firms; (iv) the introduction of data-processing techniques to the employment ser vices. This was a trial experiment in direct cooperation between national adminis trative bodies coordinated by the Com mission and involving a small group of eight national officials. However, it was so successful that Portugal has already requested that a similar programme be carried out in 1987 but on a far larger scale involving 75 Portuguese civil ser vants and some 40 civil servants from other Member States. Greece, for its part has also requested the implementa tion of a programme similar to that or ganized with respect to Portugal. In the light of the great interest shown, the Commission and the Direc tors-General of Employment of the Member States have agreed, within the framework of the new guidelines on ex changes, also to use such exchanges for the purposes of technical coopera tion initiatives in the future. 14 ",
        "SPECIFIC MEASURES TAKEN UNDER THE COMMUNITY POLICY RELATING TO THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET Study of topics of common interest However, the greatest innovation in the guidelines is the use to be made of exchanges as a structure for the joint study of topics chosen by common agreement between the Member States which may give rise to common mea sures in the employment field. Every year, the Commission and the Working Party on Exchanges will now select two topics of interest to all the Member States from a list drawn up by the Com mission on Its own initiative or on the basis of suggestions put to it by the members of the working party. Under its traineeship quota, each national admin istrative body will then choose at least one of its officials to study at least one of these topics within the administrative body responsible for employment in an other Member State. This arrangement will not prevent other topics of individual interest from being selected by each ad ministrative body by using the other traineeships available to it under its quota. A detailed procedure for the Com munity use of traineeships on topics of common interest has been drawn up. Under this procedure, a seminar will be held in Brussels when the cycle of traineeships begins \u2014 generally in March \u2014 which will be attended not only by the civil servant trainees ap pointed to study 'common topics' but also by the directors responsible for such subjects within the administrative body of each Member State. The semi nar will enable the participants to make a clear assessment of the value of studying these subjects and agree on a common approach to research. The presence of the competent national di rectors will, firstly, help to identify the aims to be pursued by studying these subjects and, secondly, demonstrate the resolve of the Member States to take joint action both together and with the Commission On completion of his/her trainee- ship, each official will draw up a report on the topic studied together with a summary setting out his/her basic ideas and any proposals based on the experi ence gained both in his/her country of origin and in the host country. The Commission will assemble and study the reports. It will arrange for the translation of the summaries and their distribution to all the national adminis trative bodies. Furthermore, after ex amining the summaries, it will make pre parations for a meeting at which the ex perience gained and the proposals made can be pooled. This meeting, which will take place in Brussels, each year in autumn, is intended to draw con clusions from the work carried out. It will also provide an opportunity for joint re flection and even a comparison of the approaches and experiences of the var ious delegations on the same subject. But above all, the meeting will have to outline practical proposals for measures which could be implemented as far as possible within the framework of the le gal and financial instruments already at the disposal of the Community. Clearly, this does not prevent the ideas which emerge from the joint study of certain topics also from yielding proposals in the longer term. This effort at joint re search and deliberation will begin for the first time in 1987. The Working Party on Exchanges has already chosen the following two joint topics from a list of nine proposed by the Commission: 1. Recent experiments carried out with a view to improving the operation of the employment market. 2. Unemployment amongst young people \u2014 what can be done to en sure transition from training to em ployment? This choice of subjects clearly re flects the current preoccupations of the Member States and the Community in stitutions. Although the topics are not new, the fact that they have been se lected demonstrates the consistent de termination of the national authorities and the Community institutions to pro vide an answer to the disturbing ques tions which they raise. Duilio Silletti Annex: Working paper 1. Priority aims In order to promote the integration of the Community labour market, the Commission and the Member States will make more use of the exchanges of employment service officials for the purposes of: (i) studying subjects of interest to all the Member States; (ii) utilizing end-of-exchange re ports whenever possible to draw useful lessons at the level of Community or national em ployment policies; (iii) exchanges of experience in the field of Sedoc, training of Sedoc staff, development of the Sedoc system and the promotion of in formation campaigns to in crease the use of Sedoc; (iv) cooperation with and between frontier employment services; (v) technical cooperation between national employment adminis trations (organization of depart ments, computerization, etc.). 2. The programme of exchanges Each year, on a proposal from the Commission and before the end of October, the Commission and the Working Party on Exchanges will draw up a forward exchange pro gramme, taking account of the esti mated financial resources for the following year. Armed with this early information on the quota of ex changes allotted to them, the na tional administrations will have suffi cient time to start the procedures for implementing the programme. The forward programme will be de finitively adopted at the beginning of the following year once the actual financial availabilities are known. The programme will comprise 'long-term' exchanges, Sedoc ex changes, 'frontier' exchanges and technical cooperation exchanges. 15 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE 3. Financial management The financial management will still be dealt with by the agreements concluded between the Commis sion and the national administra tions. The latter will, by 31 January at the latest, inform the Commission of the balance remaining from the previous year and will send it a statement and supporting docu ments. This will enable the Com mission to complete its internal ad ministrative procedure for the com mitment of expenditure which must be done to allow the exchanges to start. Annual report Each year, the Commission will present a brief report to the Direc tors-General for Employment at their annual meeting, usually held in June. The report will be drawn up by the Commission in close liaison with the Working Party on Exchanges, and will provide a succinct descrip tion of the previous year's activities and the current programme of activ ities. 5. 'Long-term' exchanges 5.1. Duration: In principle, these exchanges will last six weeks. This length of time strikes a happy medium between two requirements: the exchangee's need for enough time to study his theme and the need of the exchan gee's own service not to have to manage without him for too long. 5.2. Themes: Each year, before the end of Oc tober, the Commission and the Working Party on Exchanges will choose two common themes on the basis of a list presented by the Commission and drawn up by it on its own initiative and/or following suggestions from members of the Working Party. Then each national administration will, unless it gives a reason for not doing so, select at least one of its officials to deal with at least one of the two themes, and will send their names to the Com mission. This does not preclude other themes chosen at will by any national administration being selcted as subjects to be studied by other exchangees within the framework of the exchange quota allocated to each delegation for the year in question. 5.3. Selection of exchanges: Each national employment adminis tration will select exchangees in ac cordance with its own internal procedures. A good knowledge of the host country language is a pref erential criterion in choosing offi cials. At least two weeks before the start of the exchanges, each national ad ministration will communicate to the Commission the list of exchangees selected, giving their names, duties, knowledge of languages, theme chosen, country of destination, length of exchange. 5.4. Starting date o f exchanges: All participants in long-term ex changes will start their exchanges on the same date, unless unavoid ably prevented from doing so (ill ness, etc.). In principle, this date will be some six weeks before the Eas ter holidays. In practice, it will be fixed each year by the Exchanges Working Party according to the needs of the schedule. It is import ant to keep to this date for several reasons: (i) the administration receiving the exchangees will not be con stantly disturbed by the arrival of individual officials on different dates; (ii) it is easier to make reception arrangements for group arrivals (accommodation, general con ferences on the host country and administrative arrange ments, etc.); (iii) the bringing together of officials from a variety of countries al lows valuable cross-flows of ex periences to take place; (iv) since, in this case, the ex changes will in theory end on the same date, it will be easier to organize the exploitation of exchange results, in particular the exchanges with common themes (translation and dis semination of summaries) of each end-of-exchange report; preparation of the Commission communication to the Direc tors-General for Employment who usually meet in June; or ganization of the end-of-ex- changes meeting on common themes due to be held in the autumn. 5.5. Inaugural meeting on common theme exchanges: The day before the exchanges be gin, the Commission will organize an inaugural meeting for the ex changes, concerning the common themes. The meeting will be at tended by: (a) the directors of the departments competent, in each Member State, for the themes chosen; (b) the members of the Working Party on Exchanges; (c) the exchangees who, directly after the information meeting, will leave Brussels for their re spective host countries. In addition to the general informa tion on Community social policy, this meeting will highlight the value for Member States of studying themes of common interest. The presence of the competent national directors will mark the Member 16 ",
        "SPECIFIC MEASURES TAKEN UNDER THE COMMUNITY POLICY RELATING TO THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET States' commitment to carrying out a common action, both together and with the Commission. 5.6. End-of-exchange repons: Each exchangee will prepare an end-of-exchange report accompan ied by a summary of between two to four pages. Copies of the report and the summary will be sent to the host administration and the Com mission. The Commission will see to the translation into English and French of the summaries on the common themes and will send cop ies to all members of the Ex changes Working Party for distribu tion within their administrations. 5.7. Closing meeting on common theme exchanges: In the autumn, the Commission will organize a meeting on the common themes, to close the exchanges. The meeting will be attended by: (a) the directors of the departments competent, in each Member State, for the themes chosen; (b) the members of the Exchanges Working Party; (c) the exchangees who studied these themes in the course of their visit. The aim of the meeting is to draw any lessons to be learnt as regards the organizing of the exchanges on common themes and to contribute to the Community's knowledge and study of these themes. 17 ",
        "The deaf community in action On 17 and 18 September 1986 the recently founded European Community Regional Secretariat of the World Federation of the Deaf held its second plenary meeting in Brussels. Delegates from the Com munity of the profoundly deaf at tended from 11 Member States (only Luxembourg is not yet act ively involved) ; all the different sign languages of the countries repre sented were in use throughout the seminar \u2014 a sight both inspiring and challenging. At the seminar the Secretariat pre sented to the Commission, In English and French, a carefully prepared paper on the access problems of deaf people, well timed to contribute to the prepara tory work which the Commission is cur rently undertaking on this theme. The seminar also saw two live demonstra tions. The first was of an interactive video system for the education of pro foundly and prelingually deaf children, linking microchip and laser disc tech nology, which has been developed at Donaldson's School for the Deaf in Edinburgh. The second was an elec tronic mail box which is now fully opera tive between the leading associations in three countries (Ireland, Netherlands and UK): with the aid of the Belgian PTT, messages of good will were sent to the delegates in Brussels from all three countries during the seminar. It is easy to underestimate the im portance and worth of this achievement on the part of the members of the deaf community within our European Com munity. Indeed, it is only when we have had the opportunity to meet and com municate with them that we can even begin to understand their situation \u2014 perhaps the most commonly, largely and disastrously misunderstood of all groups in society. How many of us are aware that, for the profoundly deaf, the invention of the telephone was a social and professional catastrophe, the pos sibility of recovery from which is only now just beginning to emerge? And, on the other hand, how many of us take it as obvious that deaf people, since they do not have a visual impairment, cannot have problems with reading? To be come aware of the reality in this regard is probably the most important single step we need to take if we want our selves to become open to the deaf com munity. In fact, recent research has shown that at 16 years 35% of profound ly deaf young people have a reading age of below 7, and 55% a reading age of below 9. As long as that remains the situation, even the miracle of new tech nology will fall flat, since screens as well as books have to be read. The Commission is fortunate in two ways. First, because the open character of the 1981 action programme to pro mote the social integration of disabled people has given the Commission the mandate to relate directly to the deaf community and to develop its approach on the basis of their own expression of their needs. Secondly, because the deaf community in Europe has responded ' with astonishing energy and inventive ness as well as inexhaustible good will to the opportunities afforded by the Commission's action programme. There are many examples of this, perhaps the most important being the Initiative of the World Federation of the Deaf in founding its first Regional Secretariat, to comprise the European Community countries, in 1985. Important too is the 'Euroaction' group inspired by the UK Breakthrough Trust \u2014 responsible for the electronic mailbox project and for holiday activities for deaf young people and adults. The University of Bristol Education Depart ment has pioneered the creation of a European videobank of sign languages and is now developing European courses for sign-language interpreters. For sign interpreters too, a first all-Euro pean seminar is being organized in 1987 by the French deaf association. Mobility International includes encoun ters for deaf young people in its 'Euro- programme' of youth exchanges for the handicapped. Deaf theatre projects are being developed at European level in France, UK and Spain. An experiment in delivering Prestel-type services to the homes of deaf and other handicapped people is under way in Reading, UK. A first European seminar on access to higher education for deaf and visually impaired students has been held in Mons. These are just some of the exam ples of activities, almost all of them act ively supported by grants from the Commission, which together constitute the explosive arrival on the European scene of the community of profoundly deaf people. And immediately ahead lie two new promising developments. The Commis sion has this year initiated a first Euro pean survey of the situation and aspira tions of the deaf community; once this is completed and published we shall have a corpus of up-to-date information which has never been available before. 18 ",
        "THE DEAF COMMUNITY IN ACTION Copyright REA/Benichou At the same time the European Parlia ment has put forward two draft Resolu tions to support the education and com munication of deaf people in the Euro pean Community. The 'wind of change' is certainly blowing, but Its only just about started. There are probably more fully employed sign language interpreters in one aver age-sized State of the US than in the whole of our Community. We're on the road, but there's long way to go. 19 ",
        "European Social Fund: Resocialization project St Brendan's Hospital Dublin The project is a demonstration pilot project which is designed to develop into a model for the Euro pean Community in the resocializa tion process of long-stay psychi atric patients and produce research data to this end. The evaluation of the pilot phase of the project had three main aims: (1) To monitor the on-going perform ance of the unit. (2) To provide regular feedback to pro ject staff to enable them to intervene and modify trainees behaviour. (3) To develop appropriate and precise research instruments for use on the project. Underlying these aims was the main premise of the project i.e. that in a democratically run, multi-disciplinary unit, patients (trainees) could be as sisted in utilizing existing skills and strengths as well as developing new skills and more effective coping me chanisms. The multi-disciplinary ele ment was important in that it allowed each individual to be viewed from a vari ety of different viewpoints. Each partici pant contributed from his/her profes sional background in developing a hol istic picture of the trainee. This was es sential both in the initial baseline analy sis and in the development of an effec tive programme for each trainee. The view of each staff member was ac corded equal weighting and this contri buted significantly to staff morale. As well as the free exchange of ideas at meetings, staff views were sought in a more formal manner through question naires, etc. Maintaining high staff morale and involvement is recognized as an es sential element in any resocialization process. A good deal of research docu mentation on this topic has emphasized the difficulties inherent in such work. This is particularly so for the nursing staff, as they are required to make the most radical role change and this must be accomplished within the same gen eral social setting of the hospital, as the old role was performed. In changing from the more traditional orientation of psychiatric nursing to a modern advoca- tional role, they must cope with the pot entially more difficult 'Open Unit' without the typically coercive methods (e.g. heavy medication) of the traditional ward. Additionally, there is a more equal relationship between trainee and advo cate. This demands a greater emotional commitment from staff although it does offer potentially more job satisfaction. A change in attitude is also required from other members of the team in that they must learn to function without the secu rity of a recognizable role and position. During the pilot phase of the project, the difficulties inherent in these role changes often caused tensions. How ever, these difficulties were usually re solved in group discussion and the most obvious proof that the staffing structure was successful lies in the fig ure for turnover. Of the 21 full-time staff who began working in the project, only two left within the first phase and neither of these people left because of dissatis faction with the unit. During the second phase of the project, it is hoped to deal with this area of staff attitudes in a more in-depth manner. The third and final element in the unit's philosophy was that trainees would be assisted in recognizing their own strengths, ultimately attaining self- autonomy. This involved a completely new direction for staff. While many of the staff may have been involved in working with patients in this way before, it had been on an ad-hoc basis. In the unit an attempt was made to involve the patient (trainee) as completely as possible in all aspects of the resocialization process including the research procedure. Es sentially it was felt the person would re gain self-identity through an individual and group interactional experience. The individual approach was provided pri marily by the special advocate who was assigned to each trainee. These rela tionships provided what the majority of the trainees had never had \u2014 a warm, supportive relationship, balanced by constructive guidance and criticism. As sessments were carried out regularly and frequently by the advocates. In ad dition, a different advocate monitored the trainee over the same time period. The results were then channelled back through the advocate system. This en abled progress to be charted, providing encouragement to both trainee and ad vocate \u2014 in effect creating a multiplier effect. It also facilitated the planning of behaviour modification programmes. Trainees were involved in the overall 20 ",
        "RESOCIALIZATION PROJECT FOR PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS monitoring process and a number of simple self-evaluation procedures were designed for this purpose. When the trainees left the unit, a slightly more complicated check list procedure was used. These instruments were piloted during the first phase and it is intended to utilize modified versions of these in later phases of the pro gramme. Again, in keeping with the gen eral philosophy of the unit, the purpose and overall plan of the research was ex plained initially to trainees and thereafter any queries were answered on request. Permission was always sought from trainees before undertaking interviews. While it is unlikely that chronically insti tutionalized patients would refuse such permission to those they perceive as in authority, it is worthwhile noting that all the trainees were eager to participate and continued to do so after they had left the unit. After the initial assessments, a Trai nee Needs Profile was drawn up for each trainee. This consisted of an ac count of each trainee in terms of his/her abilities and 'deficiencies'. Because of the short time available and also due to the underlying vocational aim of the pro ject, the emphasis was on encouraging socially acceptable behaviour while correspondingly keeping unacceptable or deviant behaviour at a low level. Al though many of the trainees continued to experience severe psychiatric symp toms, the general aim was to provide an environment which would maintain these symptoms at a level at which they could function adequately. Medication: At the initial assessment of trainees, medication was reviewed for each per son and a programme of rationalization and/or medication reduction was imple mented. There were significant changes in drug intake over the six-month period. The figures show that the greatest medi cation changes occurred in the con sumption of Thioridazine (a major tran quillizer) and Chlorpromazine (a minor tranquillizer). Sleep medication (hypnot ics) was reduced by half. Five of the trainees were able to go off 'Depot' in jections (I.e. major tranquillizers) al together, (four of these trainees in fact went off all medication) and a further nine trainees reduced their drug intake by varying amounts. Only six trainees stayed at their initial medication level. Vocational training: During the first weeks of the project the vocational training emphasis was on raising competence levels and increas ing trainees' general confidence. There was also an attempt to improve concen tration (which is particularly handicap ping for psychiatric patients) by redu cing medication. The results of the med ication programme have already been outlined. When the trainees moved into the workshop phase they were as sessed on their performance using the EERC workshop rating scale. General behaviour: A resocialization programme has as its main aim to facilitate the re-emer gence of positive personality features which will allow trainees to develop more adequate coping mecharisms and attain new skills. Inherent in this Is the belief that as negative symptoms grow even healthy aspects of a personality re cede. During the first phase of the pro ject, slow and steady Improvement was aimed at. This was felt to be most appropriate for the particular type of trainee involved. Changes in average deviant behaviour ratings: The deterioration was immediate fol lowing the move and it emphasized two major difficulties of the project. Firstly, it demonstrated how traumatic sudden change can be for patients who have lived for so long in the relative security of a hospital. Secondly, it emphasized the limitations of the unit itself. In keep ing with the project's origina aims, it was envisaged that an essential part of training would take place in a custom built unit to simulate a domestic environ ment with provision for recreational teaching and other facilities as well as providing privacy for the individual. The present environment, although it has been made as comfortable and 'home like' as possible reflects the psychiatric institution which by its nature tends to limit the potential of the individual trai nee for change as well as interfering with training strategies. Furthermore some of the trainees in the first phase of the project had previously been patients there when it was an ordinary ward. The unit Is, and is perceived to be, very much within the hospital and this tends to force trainees into more traditional hospital roles. Although new strategies to soften the impact of these major changes will be implemented in the second phase of the project, there seems little likelihood that this type of trauma can be radically reduced within the present structure. Social activity: In this, perhaps more than in any other area, the successful outcome of the resocialization process can be seen. On entering the unit, trainees were asked to assess themselves in terms of sociability. The majority of the trainees defined themselves as 'bad' or 'poor mixers' and that they had few or no friends. Although all of the trainees had spent many years in the hospital, sur rounded day and night by people, they had not formed any close relationship. Most relationships in such a hospital are based on an exchange system, usu ally involving the borrowing and paying back of cigarettes. Friendship does not develop easily in institutions. This is partly because institutional life does not facilitate the privacy and loyalty which are usually part of ordinary friendships. Also, such relationships, although not openly discouraged, are not actively en couraged as is the pattern in all forms of institutional life. Social isolation is there fore one of the ironic results of long years spent in a psychiatric hospital full of people. This Isolation and lack of so ciability is easily observable in any long- 21 ",

At first they spoke infrequently, and interaction with other trainees was almost non-existent. Gradually this pat tern changed and towards the end of the project, the trainees, almost without exception, initiated conversation them selves and more importantly, vigorous discussion often took place even in the absence of a staff member to facilitate this. evaluated. The first year after re-entry, in particular, the first six months, are cru cial in the lives of resocialized trainees and their progress is now being moni tored. Of the four who returned to the hospital, one did not complete the six months training and was returned to the main hospital following a serious violent incident; two were judged not to be ca pable of coping in the community during a two week trial in the houses and one, following a two week trial, asked to re turn. Re-entry into the community: Sixteen trainees are now living in the community and are coping successfully. The degree to which they have inte grated into the community cannot yet be Hospital Living arrangements of all trainees (January 1985): Flat Unsupervised group home Supervised group home 1 5 10 All the trainees are now attending a training workshop and hopefully will move into open-employment at a later date. The fact that 16 chronically institu tionalized patients were sufficiently cap able after six months to cope in the community can be seen as a successful outcome to the first phase of the pro gramme, and, despite difficulties, they are coping adequately. The real success of the programme ultimately lies in their remaining and working in the commu nity. At present the outlook is optimistic in that regard but, until sufficient time has elapsed, one cannot predict accu rately the ultimate success of this pilot phase of the project.

        "European Social Fund: Creation of a self-managing team to develop a new product Vivegnis Belgium Following the discovery by our non profit organization of a means of using the ordinary mixed waste of a region to produce a new product in the form of a rigid insulating board, with exceptional sound and heat insulation properties containing no binder, formaldehyde or asbestos (which won the Trends/Tend ances (business/economic review) in novation prize for 1984) we went on to develop an entirely new production technology for making it. This process is absolutely original and we have taken out a European Patent on it (European Patent No 83200096.2 of 22/1/1983). The pilot scheme described in this article was to utilize the resources of an economically depressed region (in our case waste paper, textile waste and veg etable waste) to produce a product of general public usefulness using a new production process. Our pilot plant, which is still essen tially a training unit, has provided train ing for a staff of 18 young people under 25 years old, with no previous experi ence in this kind of work, in a wholly in novative production technology and the acquisition of a board-fitting technique. One third of our trainees are from the so-called marginal sections of society (former drug-takers, the mentally and physically handicapped, the long-term unemployed, and the 'drifters'). Training was geared essentially to teaching them to work as a self-manag ing and co-responsible team. The first year's progress By the end of the first year, it had be come clear that most jobs in our Pan- Terre board pilot production plant could be handled competently by each mem ber of the group of trainees, some of whom had little understanding of basic industrial technology; indeed the only job which, today, cannot be done by all team members is control of the drying oven (high degree of technical skill re quired, electronically-controlled, dan gers of overheating). The pulper and agitator: this is a cru cial job calling for a high degree of pre cision from the operator, both in his manual movements and in dosage, if massive wastage is to be avoided. This 23 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE is the key position for board quality as surance and throughput, and the stage on which the entire production line pivots. The preformer: the technique used is relatively straightforward, but an op erator who does not posses at least a very basic understanding of pneumatic and hydraulic technology and electricity may find himself stumbling from one problem to another. More training is required in this area. Sizing: again, a fairly simple tech nique, but much care and application to the task is needed to avoid serious problems when fitting the boards, as well as to keep down the level of rejects due to poor pre-sizing. The finishing line: the training for this is the same as that required for joinery work: operating a saw, panelmaker and router. Absolute precision and observ ance of safe working practices are a must at all times. On-going training in self-manage ment enables the group to analyse and criticize their own performance at all stages. Whenever a trainee does some thing badly or shirks his responsibilities, self-criticism obliges him to think out the whys and wherefores of the situation for himself, and the group helps him work out how to put it right. This insistence on self-evaluation and this workstation- based organization, has not only helped trainees familiarize themselves with the requirements of each task, and sharp ened their sense of responsibility, but has also significantly improved our pro duction line and the quality of the board itself. Job rotation to produce multi-skilled workers has enhanced the attraction of teamwork, co-responsibility in produc tion and optimized the use of plant. It has also facilitated positive self-criticism because each team member has at some time performed all the tasks. It should also be added that the in terest and enthusiasm of the trainees as a whole is due to no less a degree to the completely new approach we have taken to marketing the product. We have devised a two-pronged marketing strategy: (i) the first is socially inspired: the pro duct will be marketed in Wallonia through alternative channels (by passing what has become the established network of large super markets and DIY superstores, etc ) and by small independent contractors; this is a sheltered mar keting channel and the aim is to create jobs through the sale and fit ting of Pan-Terre insulation boards; (ii) the second aspect is: maximizing exports to generate financial re sources to train an increasing pro portion of the unemployed youth of Wallonia to create their own enter prises through the sale and fitting of our insulating board, as well as in vesting in future manufacturing jobs by the expansion of Pan-Terre pro duction plants; our export earnings will also help provide funds for the technical training of other unem ployed young people in other fields: training in the construction of the PT 101 compaction unit, training in the technique of building pedi- cabs, training in the assembly of continuous operation lime, plaster and Pan-Terre insulation board works using appropriate technol ogy in the Third World (requests to the EEC for assistance with approp riate technologies for developing countries, particularly in the ACP States under the Lom\u00e9 Convention with assistance from the Centre for Industrial Development). Two years on (i) Our trainees are by now carrying out selective refuse collection with the consummate ease of skilled professionals. (ii) The same professionalism shows through in the separation and com pacting of paper. A number of improvements have been made to the PT 101 multi-den sity compaction unit in response to unprompted suggestions from the trainees themselves: (a) the hydraulic transmission has been modified with an appreci able reduction in wear on the main piston; (b) the semi-acoustic binding sys tem has been modified to in crease throughput. (iii) A major improvement was made in product composition thanks to the acumen of the staff. Textile waste has been replaced by straw making the board at once more rigid and more lightweight. (iv) Trainees rapidly became skilled in operating the fibre grinder and dis integrator. The trainees suggested that an anti-noise hood might help reduce machine noise. A prototype was designed and made, and was found to be so effective that another pot ential market opportunity has now emerged. The extraction system was also redesigned to appreciably reduce dust hazards in the workplace. A suggestion was made that the se lection of better-quality steel for cut ting blades would increase their useful life. Trainees became actively involved in the selection of new raw materi als for the boards: grinding of new vegetable fibres, etc (v) The pulper and agitator: the trai nees' application to their work and their acumen enabled us to make substantial improvements to the process at a stage which is of para mount and critical importance to the production of the board. The improvements made included: (a) the purchase of an electronic weight indicator for precision weighing and dosage of raw materials; (b) installation of a float level detec tor to automate the dosage of water into the pulper; 24 ",

(vi) Preforming: a series of improve ments were made in response to suggestions made by trainees based on their own observations: (a) hollowing of the preformed cake was accelerated by plac ing a perforated plate on the moving platen of the preforming unit; (b) the time taken to spread the material within the frame was reduced (by adding two filler in lets); (c) transfer of the preformed cake to the elevator using two arms driven by a pneumatic cylinder; (d) automatic return of the elevator to ground level; (e) addition of a second hydraulic pump to speed up the preform ing stage; (f) development of an automatic board support hoist; (g) automation of quality and thick ness control; (h) enhancement of automation to increase output while improving working conditions.

(viii) Sizing: Our trainees had no problems in coming to grips with this skill, and once again were instrumental in making a number of improvements: (a) sizing quality was improved by a change of sizing roller; (b) a different, stronger and easier- to-apply adhesive was chosen; (c) a change of press heating plate gave an improved quality board. (ix) Finishing line: The training as originally conceived for our finishing line did not give us the degree of quality assurance we needed for the boards. Together with our trainee staff, we designed an entirely new, all-pur pose board machining centre (adaptable to all forms of prefabri cated product such as doors, win dows, etc....). In conventional machines, the board moves relative to a fixed ma chine tool. In ours, on the other hand, a numerically-controlled ma chining head moves relative to the board, which remains fixed. The in novation here is that the board is held steady by suction. This ma chine was designed, constructed and put into operation within three months. (x) Marketing: the trainees designed a series of sales documents, and we concluded that a genuinely offen sive marketing policy was called for, with everything that that concept implies. (xi) Social aspects: This second year showed that self- management can provide trainees with the means of mastering mod ern production technologies for a new type of product while being wholly responsible for the equip ment which they are not only skilled In using, but are also capable of maintaining and improving to in crease its reliability and suitability to the task in hand, which is that of manufacturing a product to the highest possible quality standards. The trainee is thus able to develop his internal resources and abilities to the full, being totally in control of his work and in the full understand ing of the importance of what he is doing both for his own job and the future of the enterprise whose goals and culture he has helped to shape. A 16 mm film was made at the end of the second year on the self-ma nagement of these trainees in our pilot plant. Conclusion At the outcome of the training, we can now say that we have a group of 18 people with an average age of 25, one- third of whom are from the 'margins of society', who are skilled professionals In the selective collection of paper and tex tiles, compaction and the production of 'Pan-Terre' insulation boards. They are capable of self-organiza tion, self-management and constructive self-criticism. As a staff, they have shown proof of creativity in the ability to generate im aginative solutions for improving both the product and the production line and by the interest they have taken in the work itself, which they control and in which they have found the total freedom needed to give full rein to their talents, which has given them an identity more than that of a simple tool of production and target for consumption to which they are habitually relegated. This staff will now be turning its at tention to the energy saving demonstra tion project 'Production of a thermal in sulator from recycled raw materials', No BM 029/85 BE. The aim of the project is to convert the pilot plant into a full-scale industrial demonstration facility, thus transforming this innovative idea from the level of a craft industry to a truly industrial ad- 25 ",

This insulation product, moreover, is the only one which answers the current concerns of many European countries for a new form of insulation to replace chemically-based insulation products so deeply implicated as causes of can cer, lung disease and other health prob lems. This industrial plant with a produc tion of 670 000 m 2 of boards will be a model unit serving as a demonstration centre not only for the whole of Europe (where considerable interest has al ready been shown in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands) but also for non-Community countries through the granting of manufacturing licences and the sale of patented machinery (proto type). All of which will take us further to wards the attainment of our goal of in creasing employment both upstream and downstream of the production pro cess throughout the Community as a whole.

        "Equivalence of vocational training qualifications between Member States Following the Council's ap proval of the Decision of 16/7/1985, the Commission has been assigned the job of matching up, as fre quently as possible, the equivalent vocational training qualifications in the various Member States for level 2 of the classification annexed to the Decision: skilled workers. The Commission has therefore set up a consultation procedure with Mem ber States and the social partners pur suant to Article 3 of the Decision aimed at achieving all-round agreement on the priority sectors in which a start could be made on the appropriate technical works. Despite the delays caused by problems with national consultation procedures, the Commission has been able to select three sectors as sug gested priority areas on which an initial broad consensus of agreement might be reached. They are: (i) the hotel and catering industry; (ii) the motor vehicle engineering in dustry; (iii) the construction trades. As the work moves into its second stage during 1987, the Commission could well add three other sectors to its list as a good 'second team', namely: (i) agriculture; (il) the electrical industry; (iii) the textile industry. The Commission has therefore asked Member States to put forward the names of experts who could take part in a series of meetings for each of the first three sectors with the aim of producing results which can be validated before being published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The techni cal aspect of the works will be organ ized by the European Centre for the De velopment of Vocational Training in Ber lin (Cedefop). The timetable for the works is: 7-8 October 1986: - meeting of offi cials of the coordination and liaison bodies in the Member States (to finalize procedural details of how to approach the task); 23-24 October 1986: - Berlin - 1st meeting of the Horeca (hotel, restaurant and catering) working group; 18-19 December 1986: - Berlin - 1st meeting of the working group on motor vehicle engineering; End January/early February 1987: \u2014 Berlin \u2014 1st meeting of the working group on the construction trades. Countries who have only recently joined the Community and who do not yet have the Community catalogue of trades and occupations under the Euro pean communicating system for jobs available and jobs wanted under inter national clearing \u2014 Sedoc \u2014 will be in vited to take part in the works with a view to later validation of the results. 27 ",
        "Development of teaching materials for migrant workers' children When the Council of Ministers, and the Ministers of Education meeting within the Council, decided in 1976 to mount a Community action programme in the field of education, they resolved to make the education of migrant workers' children a central plank of that pro gramme. Of the score or so of pilot schemes set up since 1976, two projects in parti cular concerned with the development of teaching materials were successfully completed in 1986: the first for the ben efit of Italian pupils in French-speaking countries, the second to assist Turkish schoolchildren in the Federal Republic of Germany. TRA NOI is a system for teaching Italian language and culture to Italian pri mary school pupils in France and French-speaking Belgium. The system comprises: ) four textbooks, each with its own ac companying teacher's manual; i) games for class use and to test what has been learnt; ii) audio cassettes to assist language learning; v) six books of stories and rhymes to encourage individual reading; (v) an Italian/French \u2014 French/Italian dictionary; (vi) five videocassettes with a cultural content, dealing with: the violins of Cremona, the glassmakers of Mu rano, the Venice carnival, and Ferrari racing cars ... The teaching method was devel oped after a study of the situation and language needs of Italian schoolchil dren in France and Belgium. Volume No 1 has already been validated in schools. The contents of each lesson were adapted to fit in with the normal school syllabuses of the reception country, with due allowance made for the dual ethno- linguistic identity of the migrant workers' child. The mother culture and reception culture were engaged in a constant dia logue which permeated the child's en tire curriculum, graded, naturally, ac cording to age. In this context, TRA NOI offers an ex ample of successful multi-cultural edu cation. TRA NOI is also the first attempt, at Community level, to develop a teaching method and teaching materials tailored specifically to the needs of nationals of one Community Member State who have settled in another. The entire project, from preliminary survey through to design and produc tion of the material, was headed by Pro fessors R. Laporta, F. Schino and R. Si mone for the Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, in conjunction with the Italian Ministries of Education and Foreign Af fairs. With the backing of the Commission and the German and Italian Govern ments, the Istituto is now branching out into a new series \u2014 TRA NOI Germania aimed at Italian children living in the Federal Republic of Germany. A third series is also on the drawing board for English-speaking countries. TRA NOI does not claim to provide cut-and-dried solutions for classroom teachers and education authorities. Its value lies in having opted for different versions tailored to the host regions and having pointed to the need for a rethink ing of the sort of education being of fered to immigrant workers' children. Since 1985, the Greek Ministry of Education has been engaged in deve loping curricula and teaching aids for Greek primary- and secondary-school children in the Federal Republic of Ger many. The Commission is currently In the midst of talks with Spain and Portu gal over the introduction of similar pro jects for Spanish children in France and Portuguese children in Luxembourg. These projects are first and foremost a response to particular educational needs, for it is clear that the immigrant family finds itself bathed in a linguistic, cultural and social environment com pletely divorced from that of its region or country of origin. The education sys tems and teaching methods of the host country are different to those of the country of origin. Consequently, the teaching aids used in the country of ori gin cannot be used in educating 1st and 2nd generation immigrant children. A wholly new approach had to be found which took account not only of the edu cational and social contexts, but also the various degrees of bilingualism achieved by the children themselves. The development of curricula and teaching materials for familiarizing chil dren with their language and culture of origin has also grown out of the imple mentation of Council Directive 77/486 concerning the education of migrant workers' children, Article 3 of which placed an obligation on host States to foster the teaching of the language and culture of origin in cooperation with the country of origin and to blend it in with mainstream schooling. The setting up of joint committees on curriculum development thus goes far beyond being an exercise in design ing an improved philosophy of educa tion to become an aspect of the imple mentation of a Community instrument. It would be misleading to conclude from this that the Commission's con cern is confined to the mother lan guages and cultures of Community na tionals. In adopting Drective 77/486, the Council unequivocally affirmed its inten tion not to introduce a form of educa tional discrimination, and that arrange ments made for Community nationals held equally good for immigrants from outside the Community. The Community as a whole \u2014 and the Federal Republic of Germany in par ticular \u2014 has a high population of Tur kish immigrant workers. In 1982, the Commission allied itself to a major trail- blazing project launched by the Federal German Government and the Berlin city authorities. Migrant workers' children in the ma jority of West German L\u00e4nder can now opt to be taught their mother tongue as a second language as part of the normal school curriculum. This differs from the normal run of foreign language teaching in that the language taught is that used at home. Curricula and teaching meth ods thus had to be adapted accordingly and new teaching materials developed. 28 ",
        "DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING MATERIALS FOR MIGRANT WORKERS' CHILDREN The Berlin Senate (executive agency) has published six school textbooks to take Turkish pupils from the 5th to 10th year. The contents are designed to inter lock with the mainstream German curri culum, but with a very pronounced cross-cultural bias which continually ad dresses the problems of the migrant community. The books deal with topics from the geography, economy, ancient and modern history of Turkey. The teaching of Turkish literature is coupled with an introduction the major streams of European literary and philosophical thought. The material was validated, with the Commission's help, simultaneously in Federal Germany, the Netherlands, Den mark and Belgium. A European sympo sium organized by the Berlin Senate, with Commission support, from 14 to 17 October 1985 afforded delegates from other Member States the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the progress of the project, to see how the materials were used 'at the chalk-face' and to dis cuss the problems raised by the teach ing of minority ethnic mother tongues in mainstream secondary education. The teachers responsible for teach ing Turkish in the Berlin pilot scheme were all Turkish nationals and all em ployed by the city education authority. Pupils opting for Turkish as principal second language were also able to opt for a second foreign language \u2014 Eng lish \u2014 in their 7th year. The teaching of Turkish as a second language stops in the 10th year and is replaced by English from the 11th to 13th years of upper sec ondary education. Throughout the Community as a whole, the teaching of the mother lan guage and culture has made marked progress, both as an integrated and an elective course, in primary schools. Much ground remains to be covered in secondary education, however. The Ber lin experiment has pointed to an imag inative way forward. 29 ",
        "Student handbook The Commission began its ac tion to promote the mobility of stu dents and academics long before a People's Europe and Erasmus be came catchwords with a political dimension. In the mid 1970s when the first concepts of an education action programme were designed it was felt that practical information about EC higher education systems was one of the keys to stimulate students to spend periods of study in another Member State than their own. The information to be made available needed to have a practical value for students and therefore to cover higher education systems, the conditions of access to them and also the social, economic and legal conditions for study abroad. With such a spectrum of subjects in mind the Commission asked Dr Manfred Stassen from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) to edit the first edition of the Student Handbook in 1977. Each of the nine member countries, as they then were, nominated a corre spondent, usually an official working in their education ministries, to provide a contribution about tertiary education and study requirements in their own Member States. The first edition also contained infor mation about the College of Europe in Bruges and the European University In stitute in Florence. The handbook ap peared in all the official languages of the Community. The interest expressed by students, university teachers, academic advisory boards and the like convinced the pub lishers that they had discovered a gap in the market. The Handbook was distri buted free of charge. The demand was so great that a second edition had to be published in 1979, with the third follow ing in 1981. With the accession of Greece membership of the Community had now risen to 10, and the number of official languages had grown to seven. For the fourth edition the Commission decided that the Handbook should henceforth be published and distributed in individual Member States through commercial channels. The idea was to accelerate distribution and thus reach a wider audience. The uniform structure of each country's contribution was re tained, as it had been tried and tested and was effective in providing an over view of what was available. The hand book had now grown from its first edi tion size of 175 pages to a volume of 356 pages. The urgent requirement for recognition of academic awards and pe riods of study spent abroad was set out in the texts produced by all the member countries and also in a separate chapter dealing with national councils con cerned with the recognition of diplomas. Another innovation is the detailed infor mation and the tables relating to the EC's common study programme, in which some 600 university institutions are now taking part. Detailed information about facilities provided for disabled students in all Member States in yet an other new feature. Apart from information aimed speci fically at universities and colleges and education ministries in the member countries to encourage them to under take more activities on their own initia tive, the book is largely devoted to pro viding information for students. What can a person wishing to spend a couple of terms in another EC country expect to find? First of all, the Handbook will tell him about the structure of the higher ed ucation system and will describe what can be perceived in the way of recent trends at that level. This is both useful and important, as some EC Member States have very recently introduced legislation considerably affecting the structure and length of university courses and the choice of subjects. The reader of the Handbook will also dis cover the best time to apply and where to, the documents that have to be pre sented, whether entrance examinations have to be taken, whether there are any conditions imposed regarding admis sion, whether tuition fees have to be paid, and what bursaries and grants are available to foreigners. The Handbook is also a mine of useful information about the practical aspects of life abroad, entry and residence formalities, the opportuni ties for finding accommodation and work, insurance, the cost of living and discounts for students. In the appendix to the entry on each country there is in addition to a bibliography and glossary a list containing the addresses of all the important authorities and academic in stitutions. Last but not least, there are also tables that give at a glance what is available in the way of universities and subjects. As in earlier editions, the handbook still gives a full description of the courses on offer at the College of Europe in Bruges, something many stu dents are still unaware of. The same ap plies to the European University Institute in Florence. It was not possible to include the new Member States Spain and Portugal in this edition, as it took two years to prepare. Such information will naturally be contained in future editions. This will bring the number of translations re quired in the Community languages to nine. One thing however needs to be em phasized. More than the mere flow of in- 30 ",
        "STUDENT HANDBOOK formation is required to facilitate study in different European countries. Much of the information supplied by the Member States, particularly when it is couched in dry officialese, serves to highlight the hurdles rather than present the promis ing picture with regard to the common study programme. What is described is not pie in the sky but actual develop ments taking place now, yet too few uni versities take the trouble to coordinate and negotiate about the possibility of their students following courses at an in stitution in another Member State, with the result that recognition for such courses after the students return is often not forthcoming. The European Commu nity provides financial assistance, though many students and teachers are unaware of this. Student exchanges, still the excep tion rather than the rule, should, in the opinion of the European Council of Mi lan and many enthusiastic Members of the European Parliament, take place much more regularly. Student mobility leaves much be desired. Throughout the EC less than 1 % out of 6 million stu dents in higher education (at 3 600 insti tutions throughout Europe) spend part of their course in another Member State. Indeed, academics in Europe travelled far more in the time of the great human ist Erasmus. This provided the impulse for the Commission to propose the Erasmus programme in December 1985. A catchy title, standing for European Community action scheme for the mo bility of university students. The inten tion is to provide EC grants for a one- year period of study in a Member State of the European Community. The aim is to help at least 10% of Europe's future academics to study in their chosen field and develop oroficiency in the language of another European country. And the scheme is intended not only for stu dents of the humanities, but for engineers, scientists, doctors, lawyers and, just as important, the politicians of tomorrow. All should have the chance to become acquainted with the language and mentality of a neighbouring Euro pean country, and get to know col leagues in their own disciplines. We know from reports received from previ- Copyright Irish Times/Ann Jenkinson ous award holders that lifelong friend ships can develop. This bears fruit in a continuous exchange of knov/ledge, ex perience and ideas, forging a political understanding that transcends frontiers. Will the Erasmus programme succeed in giving a powerful new impetus to academic mobility in Europe? The new edition of the Student Handbook will have an important contribution to make in this context. One last thing: this Handbook does not only provide a useful service for stu dents, academic institutions and other agencies in EC member countries. As it is the only handbook of its kind to pro vide a condensed survey of higher edu cation and exchange opportunities in the European Community, it has aroused great interest in countries such as America, Africa, Japan and China which like to give their students the chance to study in Europe.

        "Priority social developments in the sea-fishing industry One aspect of enlargement which is unique to the fisheries sec tor is that the sea-fishing industry of the Community of Twelve is, in all respects, double the size of the previous Community of Ten. The challenges and opportunities are therefore commensurate with that backcloth involving as it does such dimensions. Previous issues of So cial Europe have dealt with aspects of the sea-fishing industry, notably the joint committee forum for meet ings of both sides of industry, 1 and the question of accidents at work in sea-fishing and the provision of medical assistance. 2 These earlier publications referred to a number of areas where further action was deemed necessary or even over due, so now is perhaps the time to review the aims and outline some of the results of projects initiated by the Commission since 1984. The projects described here are funded under the provisions of the Community budget for social meas ures in the fisheries sector. In this context 'social' has been laid down as meaning measures in the field of education and training, and also subsidies for certain activities in volving medical assistance and safety at sea. This is in addition to the investigatory work being done on accidents at sea, 2 and to pro grammes presented by the Member States for financial assistance un der the rules of the European Social Fund. As a general rule, the Com mission has adopted the objective of seeking to promote knowledge about 'good practice' within the Community and \u2014 with appropriate adaptation \u2014 the wider use of cer tain teaching materials, ideas etc. In the field of medical assistance at sea, the Community has followed the advice it was given in a study on the subject in 1983. 3 A con certed effort is under way to ensure close collaboration between mari time medical advice centres. What we have sought to present is essentially a thumbnail sketch of a wide variety of projects where the Community initiative has innovated an approach or given it impetus at the start-up phase. Training projects The interchange programme for training personnel was carried out be tween 1984 and 1985, and was drawn up to respond to the hopes and exhor tations that both sides of industry had been expressing for some years, no tably during seminars and workshops on vocational training. Some 24 trainer participants from the maritime countries elected to spend time (on average about 10 working days) in a country outside their own, attending other peoples' train ing courses, examining other teaching approaches. There was a not unex pected gravitation of participants to wards the countries possessing sophis ticated simulation equipment (flume tanks) such as Great Britain (Hull) and Denmark (Hirtshals). The seminar organ ized by the European Commission (W\u00e9pion, Belgium, December 1985) had already been planned long beforehand as a feedback and follow-up exercise to the interchange programme. The sum mary paper by the seminar rapporteur (Mr Robert De Corte, vice-chairman of the Fisheries' Joint Committee) re corded a resounding list of initiatives that the interchange participants and those also present at the seminar wanted to see being taken. Interchange programmes of the kind just described were henceforth to be regarded as an annual exercise. The Commission is not in a position to undertake such open- ended commitments, but in the face of unanimity and the enthusiasm being ex pressed in the enlarged Community, a further interchange programme for 1987 is underway, again in the capable hands of Pauline Godkin at the School of Fisheries Studies, Hull. Other seminar- inspired initiatives include: the develop ment of a coordinated training pro gramme in safety and survival for EEC fishermen; development of the potential ' The European social dialogue within sectors/ Social Europe No 2/85, July 1985. 2 See Social Europe No 2/84 September 1984. 3 Dr H.

        "PRIORITY SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SEA-FISHING INDUSTRY Copyright LENSMEN Dublin for 'open learning' training provision; as sessment of the need and provision of the means for providing mobile training units in the EEC, and the development of multi-purpose fishing simulators as training aids. The United Kingdom mobile advi sory and training unit visit to North Sea ports (May 1985). Mobile training in various forms is an accepted and successful method of pro viding certain types of training to fisher men in some Member States. It has as sisted in overcoming some of the prob lems of access to training by fishermen who are remote from the main centres of fisheries training or who find difficulty in their availability to attend courses. It is probable that mobile training could be expanded in some other Member States but the exact nature of the delivery vehi cles and the training programme to be provided depends on many factors such as geography, the distribution of the fishing population, the seasonal nature of fishermen, etc. The Sea Fish Industry Authority of the United Kingdom pioneered the con cept of mobile training in the 1970s and the Community was already associated with the initiative by 1978/79 with the grant of assistance from the European Social Fund. The initiative for a demon stration visit to certain continental North Sea ports was successfully concluded by the setting-up of liaison committees in the ports of Boulogne (F), Knokke- Heist (B), Urk (NL) and Heiligenhaven (D) and in May 1985 the 18-seat school- on-wheels, bristling with a range of au dio-visual aids, computer-driven simula tor fish detection equipment etc. was launched on an agreeably surprised public, which was very quickly and effi ciently informed by the media and liai- 33 ",

The operation could not and was not billed as a training programme; a certain amount of 'skills tasting' was carried out, consisting in many cases of learning through solving real life day-to day problems presented by practising fishermen to the seasoned on-board trainers. The mobile unit was graced by a ministerial (education department) visit in the Netherlands from Mevr. Ginjaar- Maas. The detailed handbook on energy- saving for use by fishermen and fishing schools alike is an updated version of a 1980/81 report of the same name, but this time is the fruit of close collabora tion between the French and Danish in stitutes \u2014 already well-known in their respective fields - CEASM' and DIFT. 2 The handbook will be made available as and when the language versions are ready. The production of a compendium of available training materials across the Community. Unlike the Guiness Book of Records or the works of Shakespeare, the com pilation of useable reference guides to available material appropriate to the needs of a sea fisheries trainer is not just a question of supplying the self-evi dent demand. In French 'choisir c'est renoncer' would roughly translate as somebody's got to make a choice of what's going to go into the reference guide. Thanks to the almost insatiable capacities of computerized databases to swallow immeasurable amounts of material the quantitative aspect is not too difficult. The main contribution of this work will be the drawing up of a multi- language reference system in the first stage, and a multi-language synopsis at a later stage. It is envisaged that a num ber of original and/or valuable contribu tions to thinking and practice in voca tional training will be translated into other Community languages, and at this stage the Commission foresees giving the task of selection to a group com posed of both sides of industry from the fisheries' Joint Committee and a num ber of practitioners in vocational train ing. A summary report will be made available in due course. The lexikon of training terms accom panied by sketches, diagrams. Having started to organize exchange visits or \u2014 as reported below \u2014 bilateral contacts involving the North Sea Center, Den mark, it became clear to us that a suc cinct and specific guide to training terms in the Community languages was an obvious necessity. Thus came about the idea of a handbook of training terms in sea fishing, containing the diagrams 'worth a thousand words' and the words as well. This document will be made available to each and every participant in all the programmes we are currently engaged in, and will normally be avail able on request to training centres. It is appropriate at this point to draw atten tion to a particularly significant exercise being carried out by the terminology department of the European Communi ties in Luxembourg who responded promptly and favourably to a request to establish a dictionary of terms in the fishing industry. This work, being carried out under the guidance of Mr Goet- schalckx, is expected to provide the def initive reference work in the fisheries' field, and to be of worldwide use. The North Sea Center Hirtshals (Denmark) training visit from Italian fishermen. The Danish centre is typically com munautaire having non-Danes in its sen ior management and a capacity to pro duce test conditions and model nets based on the variable needs of Com munity, Third World, and ACP fishing people. This project nearer to home involved an intensive, work-orientated visit by a small fishermen group from Ancona, Italy. In the words of the director of IRPEM, Ancona, Mr Fiorentini '...the testing of trawl nets was a great suc cess and everyone hoped this visit can be followed by others ...' Thus we have started to contribute to the Community's own north-south dialogue, because the approach is rela tively straightforward involving as it does the construction of scale models of (in this case) the Italian bottom trawl Tar- tana' by the Danish centre workshops, followed where necessary by modifica tions. The Italian fishermen visitors were able to simulate a wide variety of fishing conditions. There are few simulation centres of such capacity, and the point is being debated whether the Community should be the vehicle to promote the installa tion of more of such structures. The visit to South Brittany of the Irish Coastal Training Unit (mobile training vehicle). Conceived by Celtic participants at the seminar of December 1985 (W\u00e9pion, Belgium) this spring 1986 visit of the mobile fisheries training unit not only fol lowed the example of the British unit's sortie abroad of the spring of 1985, but showed the virtues of mobile training units in those geographically more inac cessible areas in which they appear to have the most significant and, some would say, a unique role to play. The visit of the Irish unit was facili tated by the Bord lascaigh Mhara's wil lingness to allocate staff (thus depriving Ireland temporarily of its facilities) but it also takes two to make a successful op eration, and the reception in France would not have been anywhere near as efficient or colourful had it not been for the unflagging efforts of Radio Anima tion P\u00eache of Quimper. It was they who not only combined with AGEMA to en sure the comprehensive nature of the visit in terms of programme content and geographical distribution, but produced a special issue of the fisheries review Cahiers de la P\u00eache, containing for the first time in its history an editorial article in part in English penned by Dennis McGrane, Director of BIM.

        "PRIORITY SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SEA-FISHING INDUSTRY Future training initiatives will involve a continuation of the kinds of pro gramme experience has shown re sponds to need and which are appropri ate to both trainers in schools and those representing both sides of industry. The following types of programme are sche duled for 1987 in the effort to develop projects of benefit to the Community in vocational training in sea-fishing mat ters: (i) the UK and Irish mobile training units will be prevailed upon to un dertake visits to Mediterranean countries; the latter are already on the threshold of acquiring mobile units of their own; (ii) the simulation centres at Hull (UK) and Hirtshals (DK) will probably be host to further delegations In pursuit of our policy of promoting access to training facilities amongst the Mem ber States; (iii) an investigation on the development and use of distance learning materi als is foreseen for 1987. Medical assistance at sea and safety The sea as a place of work tends to show up man's intrinsic proclivity for contingency planning. The rescue ser vices are a model of international co operation and unstinting self-sacrifice, but they are still contingency orientated, coming into operation once an accident or illness has manifested itself \u2014 pre vention always comes second. Until such time as a respect for safety and health is treated by the seafarer at work, as an intrinsic part of daily life, like breathing or eating, then it will be incum bent upon us to provide the compensa tory medical assistance and rescue ser vices to a level of performance such as is available on land, and in some re spects at a superior level, because of its being at a remote distance. Following the publication of the report by Dr Lemarchand in 1983 on medical assistance facilities at sea, the Commission Immediately set about identifying areas where closer coopera tion between medical centres was both feasible and desirable, and responded to an early request from the centres at Toulouse (F) and Grimsby (UK) to acquire the computer equipment and software which could facilitate the re- Copyright Fran\u00e7oise Boiteux-Colin 35 ",

From these pioneering beginnings, guidance and assistance, given by the Directorate-General for Em ployment, Social Affairs and Education and including financial support from the European Social Fund to France and Spain following their application for as sistance in 1986, other national Medical Advice Centres (all of which have to up grade their operating systems in order to comply with international conventions and European or national rules) have now decided to pool their resources and develop a cooperation programme called 'MAC-NET' \u2014 acronym of 'Medi cal Advice Centres Network'. MAC-NET is based on the introduc tion, training for, and extensive use of new information processing and tele communication technologies, working for the progressive development of ad vanced Community telemedicine ser vices, thus increasing health and safety standards for seamen and stranded people. Reduced to its essentials, the MAC- NET cooperation programme is phased as follows: /s/p/7ase(1986-88) (i) agreement on the list of current problems; (ii) agreement on the objectives to pur sue for common action; (iii) modular training programme based on: (a) common requirements for medi cal advice training; (b) probable training modules; (iv) development of an integrated 'Infor mation exchange system', 2nd phase (1989-91) (i) extensive use of the information ex change system; (ii) development of specialized expert systems for medical advice; (iii) periodical review of the training modules and in-depth training of seamen; (iv) coordinated actions for preventive and contingency medicine services. The Medical Advice Centres meet ing in Brussels in June 1986 organized by \"he Directorate-General for Employ ment, Social Affairs and Education reached an agreement on the 1st phase and are now working on the modular training programme and the information exchange system. The objective is the training of operational teams of trainers who will be further employed under pre ventive medicine schemes involving seamen's training and in the new tele- medicine services involving contingency or rescue operations. The Spanish, French, and Italian Medical Advice Centres now have ad vanced computerized systems and Greece is to have its computerized sys tem set up in May\u2014June 1987. These facilities should enable the setting up of the information exchange system on which agreement is reached so as to adoDt a common communications agreement and a message handling system (data, voice,... and later, image) to improve: (i) Radio-medical assistance at sea, hospitalization, and repatriation; (ii) On-shore preventive medicine ser vices and assistance. In addition to the computerized sys tems, we should stress other results of the MAC-NET cooperation exercise: (i) the setting up in Paris, in April 1986, of the 'Group ad hoc' \u2014 France con sisting of representatives from all concerned governmental authorities including the 'Mission Fonds Social Europ\u00e9en'; (ii) the setting up in Madrid, in July 1986, of the 'Group ad hoc' \u2014 Spain with the same structure and func tions as the French body. In due time, similar 'Groups ad hoc' will be progressively developed in each Member State participating in the pro gramme soas to: (i) create a favourable environment at national level, and (ii) stimulate a common base of knowl edge and understanding and thus further the Medical Advice Centres cooperation programme; (iii) ensure there is a governmental body with adequate interfaces to the Community institutions and with coordinated management capacity for radio-medical assistance at sea within Europe and elsewhere. 'Technical support groups' have been set up on a national basis consist ing of EDP manufacturers, specialized doctors, informaticians and system managers in order to elaborate common proposals to define the functional speci fications and develop advanced devices needed to support the new telemedicine services. These groups are in the fore part of innovation, new technologies, in formation processing and medical treat ment. Among the 'firsts' of these 'Technical support groups' are the 'Cardiobip', a recording and transmitting device for ECG (electro-cardiogram) signals, and a radio-terminal system for the trans mission of biological information such as blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiration etc. In France, phases 1 and 2 of an ex pert system are now being developed providing assistance in the interpreta tion of ECG. At the operational level it is notewor thy that as of 1986 Spain and France \u2014 the most advanced in the cooperation programme \u2014 have already coordi nated their facilities and are providing coordinated contingency and medical assistance. The programme is creating advanced health and safety services, specialized functions and jobs, and is saving lives. Safety in the sea-fishing industry has always been a subject for legislation at national and international level, but since human behaviour can only be par tially influenced by legislation one has to turn to the behavioural sciences for guidance on how to instill an intrinsic 'feel' for safety in the day-to-day ap proach of sea fishermen. It is therefore to the training environment we have to turn since training is '... guiding the 36 ",

Following many years of work on ac cidents in sea fishing, 1 the Institut Uni versitaire Technique de Lorient was in vited to prepare audio-visual training aids on safety at sea. The first series of slides and accompanying tapes on coastal fishing are now ready for adap tation and use in Community fisheries schools and other centres of learning. Feedback reports from the latter will in dicate, we hope by the end of 1987, both the value and the use of these materials. Our most fervent hope is that we might instill a pervading sense of safety-like behaviour and thus make a dent in the mortality rate of what is the most acci dent-prone of any paid occupation in the Community. Viable, regular meteriological fore casts for shipping contribute at least to knowledge of inhospitable conditions. The British Broadcasting Corporation's shipping forecast is held in high esteem by seafarers which is why a request from the French fishermen's trade un ions to put out the BBC shipping fore cast in the French language has been approved on a pilot basis by the Com mission. This is not going to be a '... la plume de ma tante est dans le jardin ...' type of translation exercise, because the matter of information retrieval, codifica tion, broadcasting channels times and zones need to be carefully worked out and monitored.

Glasgow nautical college have also been awarded a small grant to equip their training establishment with material appropriate to the requirements and rigours of accident prevention and sur vival techniques. With a great deal of sea-fishing industry losses of life and vessels being recorded off the coast of the Scottish mainland and islands, the siting of this initiative is a poignant reminder of the ever present charm and ferocity of the sea. Any report on social actions in the sea-fishing industry would be quite in complete if it did not draw attention to the crucial role played by the European Parliament, notably as far as its willing ness to ensure the availability of the funding necessary to pursue the voca tional training, medical assistance and safety objectives appropriate to the sec tor. The Parliament's Committee on Fisheries, chaired by Mr Guy Guermeur initiated budgetary provision in 1983 and has always maintained a policy of close collaboration with the Joint Com mittee and with the Commission. Future actions will reflect the continuation of this collaboration and their continuous adaptation to the needs of a very multi- faceted industry adapting to its Commu nity position.

        "Problems of social security Themes of common interest It is almost four years now since a Community-wide discussion was engaged on the full range of prob lems which national social security systems are facing as a result of the recession. Having given the spur to that debate by its original Communication 1 sent to the Coun cil at the end of 1982, the Commis sion now feels that the discussion should be broadened and deep ened to include certain major fac tors which have hitherto been over looked. That oversight has been remedied in the Commission's sec ond Communication on social se curity topics addressed to the Council and other Community insti tutions in August 1986. The new communication high lights certain areas of common in terest brought to the fore in the various discussions sparked off at national and Community level by the first Communication. The problem areas selected \u2014 three in all \u2014 are already broadly interrelated and seem likely to be come more closely interconnected in the medium and long term, call ing for a comprehensive approach. They are the problems underlying the financing of current or pro jected needs in social welfare ex penditure, the implications of demographic trends, and the wor sening problem of the marginaliza- tion \u2014 indeed, the total social iso lation \u2014 affecting or threatening a considerable number of people in Europe. Financing needs The increase in expenditure result ing from persistently high levels of un employment coupled with the increas ing pressure of changing demographic patterns (notably an ageing population) on the sickness and old-age insurance sectors has meant calls for new re sources in the form of higher levies on the economy, and thus, indirectly, on business. This flatly contradicts the stated intention of national governments to lighten the burden of social charges on business. The approach generally adopted in most Member States has thus been to deploy a battery of meas ures designed to 'save' expenditure in the secret hope that the situation will turn the corner before more swingeing cuts have to be made in present levels of spending. It is, in fact, an indirect way of slowing down \u2014 reversing, even \u2014 the growth rate in compulsory levies. However, given the stubborn resist ance inspired by the notion of 'esta blished rights', this attitude can at least claim the merit of being reasonable. In deed, it is wholly consistent with the conclusions reached by a recent OECD report (Social expenditure 1960\u201490) ac cording to which the possibilities for ex tending the scope of social intervention up to the end of the 1980s are minimal or non-existent \u2014 but not negative \u2014 although overall social expenditure (in cluding that on education and vocational training) could at least keep pace with economic growth. But what happens after 1990? The cost of looking after a steadily ageing population will place a heavy strain on pension provision and the health service. How can a conse quential increase in compulsory social charges be avoided without resigning ourselves to major changes to the struc ture and current levels of social expend iture? And even that takes no account of the cost to the community of measures needed to combat the growing social alienation of the young and long-term unemployed. That is the backdrop to the Commis sion's suggestion that Member States shojld mount an urgent discussion at Community level on the objectives which they should be setting for their social protection systems for the 1990s and beyond. The discussion on the levels of com pulsory levies is inseparable from that of methods of financing, particularly that of earnings-related contributions. For the countries concerned \u2014 which means most of the Member States \u2014 an across-the-board review of sources of fi nance has been elevated to the status of a universal panacea, with no consistent course of action so far adopted to iden tify other sources of finance. While, for example, the argument for replacing earnings-related contributions by those linked to value-added tax may have lost its persuasive force, the idea of capitali zation either as a substitute for, or com plement to, the still widely-accepted principle of contributions is attracting in creasing support. Here again, the Com mission proposes that an in-depth study of the various possible alternative methods of funding should be con ducted. Demographic problems The slow pace of demographic change offers the necessary breathing space to make the appropriate adjust ments; but since the patterns of change are less clearly perceptible in the short- term, they are also easily overlooked. It is their long-term effect which will be de cisive for the future of the societies con cerned. The most important aspect of demographic change in Europe \u2014 as in the majority of industrialized nations \u2014 is the ageing of the population marked, among other things, by a steady slow- \u00a1ng-down of the mortality rate among older people. This virtually irreversible development will produce strains to wards the beginning of the next century on our ability to maintain social welfare systems running at their present levels of operation (particularly regarding the level of benefits). If no change is made to the social protection systems, the re- 1 COM(82) 716 ol 17 November 1982. 38 ",

Another noticeable change is the in crease in the proportion of elderly peo ple aged 75 and over and the massive rise in health expenditure (particularly for the provision of specialized services) which cannot but result from it. In view of these considerations, the Commission sees it as its duty to initiate a wide-ranging debate on the current demographic situation touched on in its August 1986 communication and on its long-term implications. The future of pension systems will be a key issue in that discussion. Marginalization Better known as the problem of the 'new poor', this phenomenon \u2014 which has spread as a result of the slow growth in the labour market caused by industrial reorganization \u2014 covers a multitude of sins. Considered solely from the view point of social security \u2014 the subject of this article \u2014 the main area of concern must be those who are not \u2014 or not suf ficiently \u2014 covered by existing social protection schemes (social security and assistance). In many Member States, unem ployed young people \u2014 particularly first-time job-hunters \u2014 simply do not have this particular safety net, while other groups of unemployed people (particularly the long-term unemployed) see their own protection being pared away, either in duration or level of en titlement. And while the numbers of job- seekers has grown appreciably in all Member States, the chances of their ever finding a reasonably secure job be come increasingly remote. They are thus liable to end up with no \u2014 or an in adequate \u2014 income, and threatened with more-or-less long-term social isola tion. But they are not alone in that, for side-by-side with their occupational un- Copyright Irish Times certainty goes the increasing instability of family life among the new poor in the form of divorces, separations and sim ple cohabitation.

        "SOCIAL EUROPE threatened when the marriage breaks down. And the situation is even worse for 'cohabitees'. Briefly, social protection systems \u2014 already staggering under the effects of the recession \u2014 will come under in creasing pressure from our ageing pop ulations and the threatened social isola tion of a large and steadily growing sec tion of society. For society to accept collective re sponsibility for these newly-emerging social risks, there must inevitably be a rise in compulsory social charges. But that is hard to square with the current climate of economic policies. So, where do we go from here? Pri vatization or a 'one-nation' policy? Ex tending or rolling back the frontiers of State intervention? There are no easy answers. Discussion and debate are im perative. Would it not, therefore, be appropri ate for Member States to join forces now to initiate exactly such a discussion on the objectives to be set for social pro tection schemes for the 1990s? Such action would help obviate the danger that, on the way to completing the internal market, Member States might be tempted to introduce social measures giving them a competitive edge over their Community partners. This quest for convergence in long- term goals would also help overcome at least some of the obstacles which \u2014 in the present economic climate \u2014 remain in the way of a closer approximation of social protection schemes in the Com munity. The Commission for its part \u2014 as its second Communication indicates \u2014 is pledging itself to take further initiatives to reopen the discussion on the future of social security schemes. 40 ",
        "Networks for contact, exchange and action: A new instrument of Community policy to promote equal opportunities Community policy to promote equal opportunities for women has broadened and deepened in recent years, 1 progressing from essentially legislative achievements (direc\u00ad tives) to a much more comprehen\u00ad sive policy embracing both the achievement of equality before the law (equal treatment) and the promotion of equality in practice (equal opportunities) by a series of concrete programmes for positive action. 1 This coordinated interlacing of law and concrete actions is empha\u00ad sized in the medium-term pro\u00ad gramme for 1986\u201490, which re\u00ad ceived the official blessing of the Council of Ministers of the Euro\u00ad pean Communities in a resolution adopted in July 1986. The programme extends over seven broad fields of action, namely: (i) improved application of exist\u00ad ing provisions, (ii) education and training, (iii) employment, (iv) new technologies, (v) social protection and social security, (vi) the sharing of family and occu\u00ad pational responsibilities, (vii) consciousness-raising and changing attitudes. Legal measures and on-the- ground actions, designed from the outset to interlock with one an\u00ad other, will be taken in each field. Some of these will be carried out through and with the assistance of networks for contact, exchange and action. I. The aims and nature of networks for contact, exchange and action The Commission has developed a battery of machinery for information, re\u00ad search, consultation and action to help it accomplish its task. Regular consultations with both sides of industry and government re\u00ad presentatives are a traditional feature of the Commission's social policy-making activities. But in the field of equal opportuni\u00ad ties, the Commission has also equipped itself with a specific mechanism: the Ad\u00ad visory Committee for Equal Opportuni\u00ad ties, whose job is to advise the Com\u00ad mission in the formulation of Community equal opportunities policies (especially by adopting opinions) and to foster ex\u00ad changes of experiences. The substantial widening of Commu\u00ad nity policy, in conjunction with the lim\u00ad ited personnel resources available on the one hand, and the disparate situa\u00ad tions of the Member States on the other, necessitated: (i) an assured, regular and increased flow of information to the Commis\u00ad sion on priority issues; and (ii) available intermediaries for contact and actions, capable of launching the required initiatives in the individ\u00ad ual Member States. To do this, six networks of experts have been set up. 2 1. One expert or team acts as network coordinator and leader, putting for\u00ad ward to the Commission names for each Community Member State. 2. The experts (and coordinators) of five of the networks are wholly inde\u00ad pendent and responsible to no pu\u00ad blic or private body for the way they perform their network duties. Experts are naturally appointed on the basis of their proven expertise in the field, but their positions and duties as national figures \u2014 and hence the practical advantages for their performance in their network \u2014 are also taken into account. 3. They are drawn from a cross-sec\u00ad tion of backgrounds (academic, re\u00ad search institutes, national, regional and local public and semi-State bodies, the two sides of industry, voluntary groups and associations, etc.) to meet one of the key criteria for Community action in equality, the need for a multi-faceted policy in\u00ad volving all the actors in the decision\u00ad making process and action on equal opportunities. 4. Each expert must be able to draw on a representative national network or team in turn to involve the maxi\u00ad mum number of people in each Member State, thus intensifying Community actions. 5. One network, however, has a dis\u00ad tinctive character developing out of its own inherent nature:\" and that is the network on television and women, comprised of representa\u00ad tives of the Community's television authorities, appointed by the author\u00ad ities themselves but coordinated by an independent expert. II. The networks and what they do 4 A \u2014 Three networks were set up under the action programmme for 1982-85: /. The network on the imple\u00ad mentation of the equal opportu\u00ad nities directives 4 This is the oldest-established net\u00ad work, and the one with the closest ties to the traditional legislative task 5 of the Community in the equal opportunities field. 1 See Social Europe \u2014 Supplement 2/86. 2 Cf, infra, point II. 3 Cf, infra, point \u0392 1.

        "SOCIAL EUROPE Set up in 1982, it consists of acad\u00ad emic lawyers and legal researchers, practising lawyers and representatives of both sides of industry. Its job is to assist the Commission to fulfil its role as custodian of the Trea\u00ad ties. The Commission has at its finger\u00ad tips information on all the legislation and regulations (including some administra\u00ad tive orders) implementing the directives. It is kept informed on these matters by the Member States themselves. It cannot, however, hope to keep on top of all the administrative provisions and terms of collective bargaining agreements \u2014 still less actual work\u00ad place conditions. The Commission therefore decided to set up this team of experts to give it\u00ad self the capability of appraising the progress made towards the implemen\u00ad tation of the directives on equality both in law and in fact. The network has already put forward three reports, and has geared its work chiefly toward the issue of indirect dis\u00ad crimination in the fields of equal pay, equal treatment and in social security matters, with reference to regulations, jurisprudence, collective agreements and actual situations in the workplace (plant-level agreements or rules ...). These reports also incorporate rec\u00ad ommendations for action at both Com\u00ad munity and national levels. The first three years' work was to culminate in appraisal by an (independent) expert; the network will move into phase two of its work in 1987, when the experts will begin not only to focus their efforts on particular issues, but also to increase awareness and information levels within legal circles of their own countries.' It should be remarked here that the network has been judged to be making a very useful contribution, not only by the Commission and the various bodies involved in the Member States, but also by the experts themselves, who have found the exchanges of information beneficial to them in their academic pur\u00ad suits, legal practice or in the workplace, thus playing their role of intermediary for Community action to the full. 2. Network on the diversification of occupational choices: advis\u00ad ers on equality in education and vocational training This network was established in 1984 to carry out the twofold functions of research and action. Its membership re\u00ad presents a wide cross-section of occu\u00ad pational life: members of research insti\u00ad tutes, equal opportunities bodies, re\u00ad presentatives of central government de\u00ad partments and semi-State bodies, em\u00ad ployers associations and trade unions. The first item on its agenda (in 1983\u201484) was to take stock of the exist\u00ad ing situation in education and vocational training for young girls and adult women, and on the basis of contacts made, to put forward recommendations for action. 2 Its second test was to launch on- the-ground actions in this field. Each expert was thus responsible for intro\u00ad ducing at least one (sometimes more) broad fronted action(s) in education and vocational training in his or her country. The result has been, since 1984, to weave a network of positive actions around three main strands: (i) awareness/information campaigns, (ii) vocational training actions geared towards emerging occupations and/or new technologies, (iii) on-the-job training. In 1987, the experts will be raising the actions so far conducted to national level and increasing their reach, either geographical or in terms of the target public. At the same time, the experts are working to develop as between them\u00ad selves (and hence between Member States) regular exchanges of educa\u00ad tional materials which could serve as basis for similar or related actions. 3. Network on women in the la\u00ad bour force: qualitative and quan\u00ad titative indicators This network, set up in 1983, marked the beginning of a more conventional scheme in the economic field focusing on employment at Community level. This network is responsible for analys\u00ad ing the qualitative and quantitative indi\u00ad cators of women's employment in an ef\u00ad fort to fill in the gaps, in both statistical and qualitative terms, in analysis of women's employment. The network is made up of econ\u00ad omists, statisticians and sociologists. Its early work (1983\u201484) was concerned with identifying the necessary indicators to paint an overall picture of women's employment, going on from there to study particular indicators and topics in greater depth. Among its current preoccupations are (i) the coherence of economic and social policies with measures affecting the employment of women and/or equal opportunities, and (ii) the position of migrant women. \u0392 \u2014 The coupling of research and ac\u00ad tion as interlocking dimensions has been resolutely carried through in the three new networks created under the current me\u00ad dium-term programme (1986\u201490). /. Network on women and tele\u00ad vision The Steering Committee on Women and Television was set up in response to the recommendations to that effect put forward in the conclusions of a joint Community/Free University of Brussels seminaron this topic.

Maillac It differs from the other networks in being composed not of independent ex perts appointed by the Commission, but of representatives designated by the television authorities of the Member States. The work of the committee is, however, coordinated by an independ ent expert. It has been in existence since the beginning of 1986 and consists largely of the personnel or welfare directors of the various television authorities. (i) It has set itself the tasks of: regularly analysing the data con cerning the position of women in each television organization; holding exchanges of views discussions on the situation; and iii) continuing existing or introducing fresh positive action to improve the lot of women in each organization on the basis of suggestions re ceived, notably those made by the coordinator; jv) exchanging information on pro posed or existing actions. 2. Networks on women in local employment initiatives The development of the Commis sion's policy of support \u2014 oarticularly through direct financial assistance \u2014 for locally-based employment in tiatives by women brought with it the need for greater coordination and coherence of its actions. The paucity of information available to the groups or individuals launching job creation initiatives, moreover, fre quently proved an obstacle to their de velopment into viable businesses. It was in this twin perspective of liai son and coordination, then, that the Commission set up this new network in November 1986. Its membership embraces a broad spectrum of interests, all reflecting these two-fold concerns: support and devel opment agencies to set up local em ployment initiatives, women involved in such business ventures, etc. The research aspect consists in feeding back data on current initiatives in each country, the provision of direct fi nancial and other assistance, the obsta cles encountered by women in launch ing their own businesses, etc. As far as action is concerned, each expert is required to promote new local 43 ",

Child-care network The sharing of family and occupa tional responsibilities is a key theme in Community equal opportunities policy. One of the main planks of that theme is the development of various child-care facilities. A study conducted for the Commis sion on this subject in 1983 formed the basis for a 1985 seminar called to dis cuss the topic. The chief recommendations of the seminar were that the situation needed continual monitoring at Community le vel, and that Community rules should be laid down to ensure that child-care facili ties of an acceptable standard were available in sufficient number. These were the bases on which the Commission established the most re cent network (end of 1986), again with a dual purpose: (i) analysing the qualitative and quanti tative aspects of the situation from the two standpoints of equal oppor tunities and family policy; (ii) fostering the development of child- care facilities including a variety of alternative forms. To accomplish what are, in the pres ent climate of economic recession, daunting tasks, the experts have been chosen with an emphasis on the pivotal role of stimulating development. They are being drawn from institu tions specializing in early childhood and family counselling, research bodies on family life, equal opportunities bodies, etc. III. Stocktaking and prospects 1. It is as yet too soon to assess what will be the overall impact of the new instruments which the Commission has added to its armoury, particu larly since more than half of them are barely operational as yet. The first three networks have by now, however, put down firm roots. With three years on-the-ground op eration behind them, including the time taken to find their feet, it would be fair to say that they have played an important part in: (i) assuring exchanges of infor mation, ideas and material be tween the Member States and the interests concerned by them; (ii) keeping the Commission bet ter informed about the prevail ing situation and the impact of the necessary policy; (iii) assuring a foundation of knowledge upon which to con struct fresh Community initia tives; (iv) guaranteeing a multiplier effect for Community policy through the implementation of concrete individual measures in each Community country. There is no question that the most innovative, and above all the most practical, aspect of the accomplish ments of the networks lies in the concrete measures supported by them, and it is action which will be the focal point of the work of the new networks. The aim is to facilitate the develop ments of a series of practical pro jects in the various fields covered by the Community equal opportunities policy, which will act as a crucible or a mine of experience which the rele vant authorities of the Member States can draw on to develop their own initiatives. There could be no better reply to the 'doubting Thomases' who question the value of networks and groups of European experts than the concrete role such networks can play, making their own, admittedly modest, con tribution \u2014 but in deeds, not words \u2014 to the building of the 'People's Europe'.

        "Equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes On 5 June 1986, the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs ap proved the draft directive pre sented by the Commission on 29 April 1983' on equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes. 2 The new directive, which was fi nally adopted by the Council on 24 July 1986 3 has had a considerable amount of ink spilt on its account by the technocrats of the Commu nity institutions, and has, for the last three years, been the focus of interminable debates within the Council, chiefly on the famous Arti cle 6 (1), points (h) and (i), which refers to the taking-into-account of the different actuarial factors for women and men. The Commission's concept of introducing 'unisex' ac tuarial tables encountered the unit ed opposition of the Member States whose aim instead was to obtain a text enabling insurance companies to pursue their present practices. While the Commission's argu ments were not supported by the Council, and the final wording of the article differs extensively from the text initially proposed by the Com mission, we nevertheless believe it would be useful to point out some of the 'acquisitions' obtained by the new Directive (I), and to try to shed light on Article 6 (1), (h) (i) (II), although of course we leave the task of settling any problems of in terpretation which could arise when the new text is implemented to the competent bodies. I. Scope of the directive This directive, as was already said in our very first issue (see above-men tioned article) concerns the implementa tion of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes. What do we mean by occupa tional schemes? (A) How does the new Community instrument contribute to the process of equal treatment? (B) A.

Un like the former, their content is therefore not defined by law but, unlike the latter, is not defined by free negotiation be tween individuals and insurance com panies. These features apply to various types of scheme whose purpose is to supplement statutory social security benefits (old-age, survivors', invalidity, unemployment, sickness benefits) or, more rarely, to take their place. They include: (i) schemes based on collective agree ments between employers' and workers' representatives and apply ing to an undertaking, an occupa tional sector or several such sec tors; (ii) company schemes set up or planned unilaterally by the employer for the benefit of his workers or cer tain categories thereof, wnether he allocates specific reserve funds for this purpose or uses the services of an insurance company (e.g. group insurance) or finances the planned benefit under the heading of staff expenditure; (iii) schemes set up by the representa tives of a self-employed occupation (craftsmen, doctors, lawyers, etc.). The new legal instrument concerns all these types of scheme. It should be said that what essentially distinguishes occupational schemes from, for exam ple, the purely individual insurance schemes, is that membership of such schemes forms part of the working con ditions, inasmuch as it stems either di rectly or indirectly from the employment contract or from the occupational activity itself. The second paragraph of Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community which provides for equal pay for men and women work ers states that pay means not only the wage but 'any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives, directly or indirectly, in respect of his employment from his em ployer'. In the case of employed per sons, therefore, benefits provided under occupational schemes come within the scope of the second paragraph of Arti cle 119, according to that definition. Furthermore, in one of its recent judgments of 13 May 1986 (Case 170/84),\" the Court of Justice of the European Community expressly stated that benefits provided for workers under a company pension scheme constituted a consideration within the meaning of Article 119 of the Treaty. The judgment therefore expressed the Court's will, even in the absence of a directive, to take Article 119 as a basis for settling problems of equal treatment. In view of the fact, however, that there are situations in which objective differences exist, and that in its De- frennell 5 Judgment (see paragraph 18 et seq. of the grounds of the judgment) the Court made a distinction between direct, open discrimination which could be established on the sole basis of the criteria given by Article 19, and indirect, disguised discrimination capable of be ing identified only on the basis of the implementing provisions, it will be seen that the directive will play an important part in so far as its constitutes the es sential complement to the article, and more clearly defines its scope.

        "SOCIAL EUROPE Thus Artide 2 defines occupational schemes. As regards the persons covered, Article 3 takes the lead from Di rective 79/7/EEC on statutory social security schemes. It therefore applies to all employed and self-employed per sons. The same is true as regards the matters covered in view of the close links between statutory schemes and occupational schemes. Where occupa tional schemes apply to employed per sons, however, this rule does not apply because benefits under such schemes are part of the consideration received by the worker in respect of his employment from his employer. Thus the scope in re lation to subject matter can no longer be limited to certain risks, it extends on the contrary to all social benefits in cash or in kind payable under such schemes. B. Elimination of discrimination The principle of equal treatment means that there shall be no discrimina tion whatsoever on grounds of sex, either directly or indirectly by reference, in particular, to marital or family status, especially as regards: (i) the scope of the schemes and the conditions of access to them; (ii) the obligation to contribute and the calculation of contributions; (iii) the calculation of benefits, including supplementary benefits due in re spect of a spouse or dependants, and the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlement to benefits. As a general rule, benefits for women are proportionally lower than those for men under occupational schemes. One reason is the frequent lack of such schemes in firms chiefly employing women, owing to traditional concepts of male and female roles in society. The second reason must be at tributed to the exclusion of part-time work from many occupational schemes. This is in fact indirect discrimination since it is women who are mainly af fected. Article 6 is aimed at a whole series of situations which must be re garded as discriminatory and therefore prohibited. The article reads as follows: 1. Provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment shall include those based on sex, either directly or indirectly, in particular by refer ence to marital or family status, for: (a) determining the persons who may participate in an occupa tional scheme; (b) fixing the compulsory or op tional nature of participation in an occupational scheme; (c) laying down different rules as re gards the age of entry into the scheme or the minimum period of employment or membership of the scheme required to obtain the benefits thereof; (d) laying down different rules, ex cept as provided for in subpara graphs (h) and (i), for the reim bursement of contributions where a worker leaves a scheme without having fulfilled the conditions guaranteeing him a deferred right to long-term benefits; (e) setting different conditions for the granting of benefits or res tricting such benefits to workers of one or other of the sexes; (f) fixing different retirement ages; (g) suspending the retention or ac quisition of rights during periods of maternity leave or leave for family reasons which are granted by law or agreement and are paid by the employer; (h) setting different levels of benefit, except in so far as may be nec essary to take account of actu arial calculation factors which differ according to sex in the case of benefit designated as contribution-defined; (i) setting different levels of worker contribution; setting different levels of em ployer contribution in the case of benefits designated as con tribution-defined, except with a view to making the amount of those benefits more nearly equal; (j) laying down different standards or standards applicable only to workers of a specified sex, ex cept as provided for in subpara graphs (h) and (i), as regards the guarantee or retention of entitle ment to deferred benefits when a worker leaves a scheme. 2. Where the granting of benefits within the scope of this directive is left to the discretion of the scheme's man agement bodies, the latter must take account of the principle of equal treatment. It is to be regretted, when one com pares the wording of this article, espe cially paragraph 1, (h) and (i), with the original Commission proposal, that the Council did not adopt the text proposed which, moreover, had the approval of the European Parliament and the Econ omic and Social Committee. II. Article 6 (1), (h) and (i) The text proposed by the Commis sion prohibited different actuarial factors being taken into account for the calcula tion of benefits and contributions. The new wording provides for: (i) equal benefits except under certain schemes which are allowed to use actuarial factors which differ accord ing to sex; (ii) equal worker contributions (which conforms to the Commission propo sal); (iii) equal employer contributions only in the above-mentioned excepted schemes for which different actuarial factors may be used to calculate benefits. The aim of the Member States in adopting this text was to avoid upsetting insurance companies' present practices too much. Such practices for example 46 ",
        "EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN involve giving women a smaller pension on the ground that on average they will benefit longer as their average life ex pectancy is longer. The Commission made every effort to convince the Member States, refer ring inter alia :o the recent case-law of the US Supreme Court which ruled that this practice was discriminatory. It should be said here that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has not yet been required to rule on whether the cifference made between men and women in the calculation (based on actuarial factors) of contribu tions or benefits under occupational schemes is in conformity with Article 119. When the Council of Social Affairs Ministers approved the Directive of 5 June 1986, the Commission insisted that the following statement be included in the minutes: 'The Commission has to express serious doubts about the proposed wording with regard to the principle of equal treatment. It continues to consider that the calculation of individual contrib utions and benefits should in no circum stances take into consideration actuarial data which differ according to the sex of workers. In this connection it would re call that this position, which is justified by the arguments put forward in its initial proposal for a directive, has been shared by the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. If the Commission agrees to with draw its reservation, this is merely so as not to delay the adoption of the directive and in recognition of the progress made on other points, in particular equality in the calculation of workers' contributions and acceptance of reasonable time lim its for implementing the directive.' Conclusions The principle of equal treatment has, as we know, been the subject of several Community Directives. Implementation of this principle in the social security field has been gradual owing to the number of problems and the complexity of the different social protection sys tems in the Member States. The first step in this direction was Directive 79/7/EEC, now in force, which concerns statutory social security schemes. The Directive of 24 July 1986 consti tutes the second stage of the operation, introducing new Community standards to promote this principle in occupational schemes. Whilst it is true that the transitional period for the application of this Direc tive (it expires on 1 January 1993) and for certain risks is very long (see Arti cle 9 (c)), nevertheless discriminatory treatment of men and women in occupa tional schemes will be eliminated, and we now have a binding instrument and all it entails to this effect. It would indeed be hard to imagine a Member State now taking any measures representing a step backwards in relation to the situa tion at the time of the adoption of the di rective. And indeed Article 9 of the di rective already announces the future di rective on social security which is to fill the gaps in the first two instruments, notably as regards the determination of pensionable age and survivors' pen sions. It could be said that this repre sents a commitment by the Member States ' and a mandate for the Commis sion to finish, by means of a new, bind ing instrument, the process begun in 1978. Preparatory work in this area is al ready at a relatively advanced stage and the Commission will be presenting rele vant proposals within the next few months. Dimitrios Kontizas The second programme on equal opportunities also provides for this directive. 47 ",

        "The social policy of the European Community The following account is con fined to the social policy of the Eu ropean Economic Community and does not therefore cover the Euro pean Coal and Steel Community or Euratom. It describes in broad outline, the social policy of the EEC from 1958 to 1985, divided into two periods, 1958-72 and 1973-85. I. The social policy of the European Communities in the period 1958\u201472 A. The specific social provi sions of the Treaty of Rome The basis of the social policy of the European Community was and remains the Treaty of Rome. However, on read ing the Treaty, it immediately becomes apparent that it devotes relatively little attention to social policy and concen trates first and foremost on the eco nomic tasks for which the Community was created. It contains a few general provisions on social policy (see in parti cular, the Preamble, Article 2 and Article 117) which have little concrete sub stance, together with specific provi sions, which are often expressed in rather vague terms. These specific social provisions formed the basis of the activities under taken in the first few years of the Com munity's existence: the gradual achieve ment of the free movement of labour (Articles 48 and 49), the safeguarding of employees' rights deriving from social security systems (Article 51), promoting the exchange of young workers as part of a Community programme (Article 50), application of the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women (Article 119), the establishment of the European Social Fund, with the task of facilitating employment in the Communi ties and stimulating the geographical and occupational mobility of workers (Articles 123-127), and the establish ment of general principles for the appli cation of a common policy on vocational training (Article 128). 1. The free movement of labour was introduced in three stages and finally completed on 15 October 1968 (entered into force on 8 November of the same year). This was more than a year before the end of the transitional period (end of 1969). All employees in the Community, irrespective of nationality, may accept jobs they are offered, may stay in other Member States for such purposes, may settle there for work purposes and bring their families to live with them. They en joy the same rights as the citizens of the host country as regards wages/salaries and other conditions of employment. The only restrictions which still apply in respect of the free movement of labour relate to public order, public security and public health or relate to posts in the government service. At the end of 1972, the Sedoc system (European sys tem for the international clearance of vacancies and employment applica tions) came into being. The purpose of the system is to re serve jobs which cannot be filled by em ployees of one country for employees from other Community countries. 2. The coordination of social secu rity for migrant workers effected on 1 January 1959 in Regulations 3 and 4 was based on the following principles: (i) equal status for employees from the Member States and national em ployees (equal treatment); (ii) the possibility of transferring social benefits from one country to another (export of benefits beyond national frontiers); (iii) adding together periods of time worked and social contributions paid in more than one Member State for the purpose of calculating benefits (composition and calcula tion pro rata temporis). Regulations 3 and 4 were constantly adapted in the light of changes in na tional legislation in the Member States. They underwent a general simplification, improvement and extension In 1971 and 1972; Regulations 3 and 4 were re placed by Regulations 1408/71 and 574/ 72, which took effect on 1 October 1972. They apply to all salaried/wage-earning employees (including therefore sea sonal and border workers, refugees and Stateless persons) and their families. The regulations relate to dangers in cluded in Convention No 102 of the In ternational Labour Agreement. They ap ply to general and specific social secu rity systems governed by law, contribu tory or otherwise, but not to supplemen tary regulations. 51 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE 3. Under the terms of Artide 119, the principle of equal pay for men and women should have come into effect before the end of the first stage of the transitional period (end of 1961). But agreement could not be reached about the interpretation of 'equal work'. Gov ernment representatives and represen tatives of the employers' organizations (with the exception of France which had pressed for this article to be included in the Treaty of Rome on account of competition considerations) were in favour of a very narrow interpretation (equal pay only for identical or mixed work) but the employees' organizations Copyright REA/F. Pitchal favoured a broader interpretation. The Commission resolved the issue in its recommendation of 20 July 1960: a broad interpretation was chosen in the sense that the principle would not only apply to identical or mixed work but also to work of equal or equivalent impor tance. It was already clear by this time that even if all the Member States were to follow this interpretation, the principle of equal pay could not possibly be intro duced into all the Member States before the end of 1961 (differences in wage le vels were as great as 20% or 30% or more). After numerous sessions a com promise was finally reached at the 11th hour and included in the 'Resolution of the Member States united in the Coun cil' of 30 Decembe' 1961. The broad in terpretation of equal work had become fact. The deadline of the end of 1961 was replaced by a rolling calendar whereby differences in pay levels were to be reduced to 15% before 30 June 1962,10% before 30 June 1963 and 0% before 31 December 1964. 4. The European Social Fund, the most important instrument created by the Treaty in the field of employment policy, came into operation on 20 Sep tember 1960. The Fund provides finan cial assistance to facilitate employment and to stimulate geographical and occu pation mobility, so that the unemployed, the partially unemployed and the dis abled can once again become involved in the production process. Assistance is provided for retraining, in-service train ing and refresher courses and the relo cation of employees, amounting to 50% of the costs involved, while the remain ing 50% is borne by the Member State. The financial resources allocated to the Fund were extremely modest to be gin with. Furthermore the Fund could only act after the event, in other words once an employee had been employed in a productive job for at least six months after retraining and relocation. Its support also depended to a large ex tent on the infrastructure and the finan cial resources available for retraining in the various countries. It was therefore not surprising that the main beneficiary of the first European Social Fund, which operated until 1971/72, was the Federal 52 ",
        "THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY Republic of Germany. In total, assist ance amounted to 400 million units of account, the largest part of which was spent on retraining. More than 1.1 mil lion employees benefited from the scheme, including approximately 800 000 Italians. 5. The first programme for the ex change of young employees between the Member States came into being on 8 May 1964. Both the development and the practical application of the pro gramme met with numerous problems, particularly since certain Member States attached considerably more importance to bilateral agreements (for example the friendship treaty between France and the Federal Republic of Germany). It was many years before new pro grammes of any real significance came into being. 6. As far as the general principles for the application of a common voca tional training policy are concerned, 10 principles were laid down by the Coun cil on 2 April 1963. They subsequently gave rise to considerable disagreement. The principles were approved by the Council by a simple majority decision when the Benelux countries and Italy voted against the Federal Republic of Germany and France. The last two Member States consistently contested the validity of the decision. B. The discussion of Article 118 In 1958, the Commission began pre paring the decisions to be taken to implement, either at once or gradually, the specific social provisions of the Treaty of Rome. In Article 118, the Com mission was assigned the task of pro moting close cooperation in the social field between the Member States on the one hand and between the Member States and the Commission on the other. A number of areas were indicated as a general guide rather than set out as an exhaustive list. The Commission began to delib erate on the type of social policy that should be pursued at Community level. With the gradual enlargement of the Community, it needed to gauge what measures had to be taken and Imple mented on the social level, if the ulti mate objectives of integration were to be attained and if the new economic and political reality, which was to be achieved gradually, was to be ex pressed in provisions, arrangements and structures suited to the needs of the new society and acceptable to the peo ples of the new Europe. The Commission therefore sought the opinions of the representatives of the national employers' and employees' organizations in the six Member States. Consultations were time-consuming but they took place in an excellent atmos phere. After three sessions, agreement was reached: the problems brought up by the employers, namely jobs, the em ployment of young people and women in industry, and the financing of social security, would be tackled at the same time as the problems raised by the em ployees, i.e. wages and length of time worked. It was decided that the Com mission's departments would collect in formation on these subjects and that the data would be analysed in work groups assembled on the basis of equal repre sentation, after which the plenary ses sion would discuss the action to be taken in the various fields concerned. A major conference on social security would be organized to which govern ments and employees' and employers' organizations would be invited and which would deal with all the major is sues. Suddenly several governments questioned the consultations with em ployers' and employees' organizations. This was the beginning of the most diffi cult period for the Commission in rela tion to social policy, a period which lasted for some years. The basic questions which were be ing asked at this time can be summa rized as follows: does the autonomous control of social policy remain in the hands of governments or should the Community develop its own social pol icy and, if so, what would be the objec tives of such a policy? Should the Com munity concern itself with social ques tions merely in so far as they distort competition or should it develop an all- round social policy? At European level, will social policy have an intergovern mental character where unanimity is al ways necessary, where each of the Member States has a veto, or will it take the form of a general Community policy where the Council is the competent au thority, where the Commission has the right to take initiatives, the European Parliament and the Economic and So cial Committee are asked to make rec ommendations, the Commission deter mines the subjects on which it will de velop proposals and also decides the type of legal instruments in which the proposals will be contained? Should the Commission address itself to individual national governments if it wishes to dis cover the views of national employers' and employees' organizations on a par ticular subject or aspect, so that it can also take their views into account or does the Commission have the right, or duty even, to contact both sides of in dustry (the 'social partners') not only to inform and consult them but also to have them play an active role in prepar ing and working out proposals? A solution was found on 19 Decem ber 1966 when, at a meeting in Brussels, the Council opted for a very modest form of ad hoc cooperation based on studies. This pragmatic form of cooperation with representatives of government and the two sides of industry in bi-partite and tri-partite groups was gradually ex tended. A programme of work to imple ment Article 118 of the Treaty of Rome was approved by the Council in two parts successively on 7 June 1967 and 29 February 1968. Broadly speaking, it contained provisions for 60 or so studies. C. Towards a Community social policy 1. All the material collected be tween 1958 and 1970 not only contri buted to what has been described as the 'spontaneous harmonization' needed in order to progress; it also laid 53 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE the foundations for the Community so cial policy which has developed since 1971 and even more rapidly since 1974. Studies, usually of a comparative nature, were made of a large number of sub jects in the social field, a great deal of statistical data was collected, a large part of it by means of Community sur veys, and finally numerous conferences and meetings were held. 2. Secondly, an extremely important process was set in motion: the correla tion between social policy and other areas of policy. The Commission systematically brought up the question of social policy in practically all of the forums concerned with other policies, convinced of the desirability and neces sity to treat the economic dimension and the social aspect in an integrated fashion at all times. The first three 'Eco nomic policy in the medium term' pro grammes which were approved by the Council on 11 April 1967, 12 May 1969 and 9 February 1971 respectively, were all interspersed with the social aspect. The Mansholt Plan in the late 1960s gave a new direction to the common ag ricultural policy. The structural improve ments which it entailed were to have far- reaching social consequences. For this reason, temporary social provisions were necessary. They were made among others in the three Directives of 17 April 1972 (early retirement, social- economic information, retraining of agri cultural workers etc.) and by making Ar ticle 4 of the European Social Fund, which had been reformed in 1971, appli cable to the agricultural sector (retrain ing of workers who leave the agricultural sector to work in other sectors). Within the framework of a common transport policy, the Council decided on 13 May 1965 that a number of social provisions which influence competition in and between the three transport sectors (roads, inland waterways and railways) needed to be harmonized. A regulation was drawn up on the composition of crews, driving and rest periods etc., in respect of goods transport by road and was approved by the Council on 25 March 1969. It remained in force in broad terms until 1985. On 10 October 1970, a proposal was submitted by the Commission about the representation of emoloyees in a European limited liability company which was to be set up. And fi nally in the field of the harmonization of company law, on 9 October 1972, the Commission presented a draft directive to the Council (the so-called Fifth Direc tive) which also addressed the problem of the representation of employees. In short, social policy was being dealt with in all kinds of contexts. 3. Thirdly, the serious social unrest in 1968 was to have major conse quences for social policy in the Member States and at Community level. In practi cally all of the Member States it had a serious effect on 'labour relations', i.e. the relationship between government, employers and employees. However, the unrest did not affect labour relations alone. It was the youth of Europe, the students, who formed the vanguard of movements protesting against the exist ing system, demanding new and differ ent ways of living together. They were opposed to what they described as 'al ienation', desiring to make human be ings active and responsible members of a society where individuality could be expressed more freely. 4. Fourthly, new structures of em ployers' and employees' organizations came into being at the European level, for example the reorganization into a Eu ropean federation of the union secretar iat of the IVVV into a European federa tion and the strengthening of the Euro pean organization of the WVA, together with the establishment of the European liaison body between the two strongest union federations in France and Italy, the CGT and the CGIL which had not taken part in the life of the Community up to that point. This new situation also contributed to more emphasis being placed on European integration, includ ing its social aspects. The Commission consistently stimulated this process and actively supported it by stressing from the outset the need to involve the social partners as actively as possible in the integration process in general and in so cial and economic policy in particular. They were not only involved in the pol icy informally; formal structures were also created providing them with oppor tunities such as tripartite committees for the European Social Fund, for the free movement of employees, for vocational training for the social security of migrant workers, the Standing Committee on Employment (established 14 December 1970) and a number of joint consultative committees on which the two sides were equally represented, to deal with social problems in specific sectors (agriculture, fisheries, road traffic, inland waterways, railways, the shoe industry etc.). 5. Fifthly there was the Summit Con ference of Heads of State and/or Gov ernment at The Hague in 1969. On the one hand the summit emphasized re form of the European Social Fund, while on the other it urged coordination of so cial policy. (a) Reform of he European Social Fund was to be carried out at the end of the transitional period specified by the Treaty of Rome. It was implemented by the Council Decision of 1 February 1971, which came into effect on 1 May 1972, in response to a Commission proposal. Two areas were dealt with: Article 4 created the possibility of providing as sistance if the situation on the labour market were to be disrupted or threat ened with disruption as a result of Com munity policy or if joint action were nec essary to ensure that supply and de mand on the labour market were in bet ter harmony. On the basis of this article, the Council took decisions on retraining, transfer and similar measures for the benefit of workers leaving agriculture to work in other sectors, employees from the textile and clothing industry who were obliged to seek work elsewhere, migrant workers, the disabled, the un employed or young people below the age of 25 seeking work, and women. Article 5 created the possibility of providing assistance in certain difficult situations connected with employment. In this field, activities focused mainly on underdeveloped regions or where eco nomic activity was in decline, problems affecting certain groups of concern, ad justment to progress in technology, the disabled, older employees' and women 54 ",
        "THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY above the age of 35. In addition to these two major categories of interventions, the possibility was also created of finan\u00ad cing preparatory studies and pilot ex\u00ad periments from the European Social Fund. From a financial viewpoint, it was im\u00ad portant that the Fund should not be fi\u00ad nanced in the future through contribu\u00ad tions from the Member States but from the Community's own funds, that the ap\u00ad propriations and expenditure for meas\u00ad ures under Article 5 should not amount to more than 50% of total appropriations and therefore expenditure, that as far as operations which might extend over a multi\u00adyear period were concerned, the Commission would have the opportu\u00ad nity to commit itself for a period of up to 3 years, and that as a result of the re\u00ad formed European Social Fund, assist\u00ad ance could also be provided in the future to private institutions, including industry. (b) As far as the coordination of so\u00ad cial policy is concerned, the 'Blueprint for a Community Social Programme' of 17 March 1971, analyses the situation as it had developed since 1958. It goes on to formulate social objectives concern\u00ad ing which a fair degree of agreement ex\u00ad isted among the Member States (full or, at least, optimum employment, greater social justice, better living conditions) and finally it indicates a number of prior\u00ad ities to be included in a Community so\u00ad cial programme and effected in the first phase of economic and monetary union. The document was intended primarily as a starting point for wide\u00adranging con\u00ad sultations within the Community bodies (the Council, Parliament, Economic and Social Committee, Consultative Com\u00ad mittee of the ECSC) and the two sides of industry. The deliberations would then be expressed in a coherent pro\u00ad gramme of work aimed at implementing in stages the closely harmonized social policy of the Member States. D. Conclusion Looking at the period 1958\u00ad whole, we can conclude that: \u25a072 as a (i) the specific social provisions of the Treaty of Rome were put into effect, some with greater success than others; (ii) the struggle to interpret Article 118 hampered progress in the social field for a considerable time; (iii) the opportunity presented itself in the late 1960s and early 1970s to create a common social policy. II. The social policy of the European Communities in the period 1973\u201485 A. The 1974 social action programme Social policy was dealt with in Item 6 of the final communiqu\u00e9 of the summit held in Paris in October 1972. It stressed that strong action was needed in this field, that it was no less important than economic and monetary union, that it was essential for the social partners to participate to an increasing extent in the economic and social decision\u00admaking of the Community and finally that a so\u00ad cial action programme should be drawn up before 1 January 1974. In January 1973, the Commission immediately started working out a pro\u00ad gramme. First it produced 'Policy lines for a programme of social action' on 11 April and then on 25 October after lengthy and detailed discussions, it sub\u00ad mitted final proposals for a programme, together with a draft resolution. The res\u00ad olution concerning the social action pro\u00ad gramme was approved by the Council on 21 January 1974. The governments of the Member States agreed to take some 30 to 40 measures over an initial period of three to four years to achieve three main objectives: (i) full employment and job\u00adcreation within the Community; (ii) improvement of living and working conditions with a view to achieving subsequent progress based on mutual harmonization; (iii) increasing involvement of the two sides of industry (the 'social part\u00ad ners') in the economic and social decision\u00admaking of the Community and of employees in the day\u00adto\u00adday running of companies/enterprises. It would be impossible to list all the measures which were proposed. What is important is that they gave the Com\u00ad munity the opportunity of pursuing a more active social policy than permitted by the Treaty of Rome, in three main re\u00ad spects: (i) While the Commission had con\u00ad cerned itself thus far primarily with employment, terms of employment, social security etc. relating to em\u00ad ployees, the programme of action suggested that more should be done at Community level for catego\u00ad ries of people regarded as 'disad\u00ad vantagd'. This was the reason for proposals for specialized action programmes to benefit migrant workers and their families (mainly from third countries), the disabled, more vulnerable persons (young people and older workers) and mea\u00ad sures to combat poverty in the Community. (ii) Under Article 118 of the EEC Treaty, the Commission was restricted to carrying out studies and surveys, publishing recommendations and organizing consultations to promote cooperation between the Member States in the social field. In connec\u00ad tion with the social action pro\u00ad gramme, the Council \u2014 for the first time as faras social policy was con\u00ad cerned \u2014 gave permission for the adoption of directives which, unlike recommendations, were to be bind\u00ad ing on the Member States. In Febru\u00ad ary 1975, for example a directive was adopted by the Council (on the basis of Article 100) putting into ef\u00ad fect the principle of equal pay for men and women, together with a di\u00ad rective on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on col\u00ad lective dismissals. After these initial steps, other proposals for directives were submitted by the Commission and adopted by the Council: two di\u00ad 55 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE rectives on employment law con cerning the maintenance of employ ees' rights, in the event of concerns or parts thereof being transferred elsewhere or in the event of insol vency of their employer and, in the field of working women's rights, a Directive of 9 February 1976 on the equal treatment of men and women in respect of access to the labour market, vocational training and promotion, together with a Directive of 19 December 1978 on equal treat ment in the field of social security. In addition, a number of directives con cerning the prevention of accidents at work and the protection of the health of employees were proposed and adopted, particularly a frame work directive on the protection of employees against exposure to chemical, physical and biological substances, which resulted in pro posals for more specific directives on dangerous substances (lead, as bestos, cadmium, benzene etc.). (iii) Finally, opportunities were created for ad hoc consultations between governments and professional bod ies in various areas: consultative bodies on employment policy, on social security, on the equal treat ment of men and women and safety at work, on the establishment of a European Centre for Vocational Training and a European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions. Broadly speaking, of the 30 to 40 measures proposed in the action pro gramme, the large majority had been put into effect within three years of 1974. In subsequent years, the measures have largely been pursued further. B. The period 1977\u201480 The 1974 recession, which was the result of the first oil crisis, had very se vere consequences. Unemployment doubled from 3 million in 1974 to 6 mil lion in 1978. The Community was slowly recovering when it was hit by the sec ond oil crisis and confronted with a gen uine economic recession. The Com mission which took office in 1977 had five objectives in relation to social pol icy: a return to full employment, humani- zation of all aspects of work, combating discrimination and all forms of inequal ity, increased social security and better public health facilities, and greater parti cipation and involvement by the social partners at all levels. However, rapid rise of unemployment soon made it clear that there could no longer be any ques tion of an expansive social policy. As a result of the deterioration in the employment situation, the highest prior ity was given to combatting employ ment. This was to take up virtually all the time and manpower available. It was not therefore surprising that there were no spectacular achievements in the other four fields. A large number of activities were deve loped to combat unemployment: (i) cooperation between national em ployment exchanges/job centres was intensified, understanding of he labour market was improved by means of research, statistics, fore casts etc. and the Sedoc system be came completely operational and endowed with a uniform language etc; (ii) the Standing Committee on Employ ment was systematically and regu larly consulted on all problems rela ting to the labour market and em ployment. The Commission put forward recom mendations such as those concerning measures to be adopted by the Member States with a view to preparing the un employed or young people under the age of 25 threatened with unemploy ment, for work (6 July 1977) and sent proposals to the Council which were ap proved by the latter, such as the second programme for the exchange of young workers between Member States (16 July 1979), the Resolution concerning linked work and training (18 December 1979) and the Resolution on 'Guidelines for a Community employment policy' (June 1980). A second reform of the European Social Fund was carried through on 28 October 1977. From 1978, the resources of the Fund were to be devoted matter of priority to the solution of employment problems in the less-favoured regions. At the same time, the rate of aid for these regions was to be raised from 50% to 55%. After that date, the greater part of the Fund's resources (amounting to approximately 1 000 million EUA in 1980) went to Irelanc, southern Italy, var ious regions of the United Kingdom and France. At the request of the European Council of 6/7 July 1978 in Bremen, the Council adopted a Regulation on 18 De cember 1978 introducing a new form of assistance from the European Social Fund to promote the recruitment of young people for additional jobs in in dustry or to promote the employment of young people in community-service projects. This created for the first time the possibility of spending money from the ESF directly on job creation. In 1979 approximately 450 C00 young people profited from this scheme and more than half a million in 1980; this involved sums of more than 300 million EUA in 1979 and approximately 360 EUA in 1980. In early 1979, the Commission is sued a communication on various social measures to be taken to accompany the restructuring of the steel industry. It ar gued, amongst other things, in favour of making financial support available for four new measures: early retirement, the reduction in the number of hours worked, the reduction of overtime and the introduction of a fifth shift. These problems were discussed for two years until in mid-1981 the Council agreed to make 112 million EUA available for the first two measures. Possibly the most significant activity undertaken by the Commission to com bat unemployment consisted in the dis cussions which it instituted and encour aged in all forums concerning the redis tribution of work The subject was on the agendas for the tri-partite conference or ganized in the period 1977\u201479 (meet ings of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance plus the Ministers of Social Affairs, the representatives of the Com mission and the social partners), the 56 ",
        "THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY Copyright REA/D. Maillac sessions of the Council of Ministers of Social Affairs and the meetings of the Standing Committee on Employment. In accordance with its mandate from the European Council of 12/13 March 1979 in Paris, the Commission pro duced a wide-ranging 'Communication on the redistribution of available work' on 9 May 1979. On 22 November 1979, the Council of Ministers of Social Affairs adopted a 'Resolution on the modifica tion of working times', in which they gave their approval for the guidelines to be followed in this area. In accordance with the resolution, the Commission drew up two draft directives; one con cerning voluntary part-time working, a second concerning agency staff or tem porary staff, ard it also worked out a draft recommendation on the principles of a Community policy concerning re tirement age (gradual introduction of a flexible and progressive retirement age). C. The period 1981-85 Economic growth declined in this period. In 1979 it was still 3% but in 1980 it sank to 1.7%. The Community even experienced negative growth of -0.5% in 1981. In the 1982-85 period, the Community began to recover but only gradually. The figures for subse quent years were as follows: 1982 + 0.6%, 1983 +1%, 1984 +2.2%, 1985 + 2.3%. Unemployment, however, re mained the same, not only as a result of weak economic growth but also be cause of demographic developments (the arrival on the labour market of young people born before 1967/68 cou pled with a smaller number of people reaching retirement age) and the increa sing tendency of women to work. The unemployment figure went up from 6.5 million in 1980 to 8.6, 10.5, 11.8 and 12.4 in subsequent years and to 12.8 million in 1985. Of the total number of people unemployed in 1985, approximately 4.8 million were under the age of 25. In 1981, the Commission estab lished four main priorities in the social field: (a) the development of an economic and social strategy to combat unem ployment; (b) the reform of the European Social Fund; (c) a review of the problem of social security; 57 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE (d) the continuance of the programme concerning health and safety at work. Point (a) 1. A first step towards a possible common and constructive strategy to combat unemployment was taken at the Jumbo meeting of 11 June 1981, pre pared by the Council of Ministers of So cial Affairs on 10 June 1981. The docu ment submitted by the Commission pointed out that it was vitally important at Community level to attempt to streng then measures agreed in joint consulta tions in order to do the following: diver sify and manage anti-inflation policy with a view to economic recovery; place more emphasis on areas which offer op portunities to extend employment such as energy and technologies on the one hand, small and medium-sized busi nesses, cooperatives etc., on the other; review the current method of financing social security; stimulate flexibility of working hours; integrate education, vo cational training and work for all young people during a transitional period after school; and increase the understanding of all concerned of new forms of infor mation technology. 2. A second step towards this strategy was taken on 12 July 1982 when the Council approved a Resolu tion on 'a Community programme to combat unemployment'. The main points were: productive private and gov ernment investment should be stimu lated to increase the competitiveness of industry and promote economic growth and the growth of employment; Commu nity instruments must be used in an ef fective and cohesive manner, particu larly for the benefit of areas most seri ously affected by unemployment; indus trial restructuring programmes must deal with problems connected with in vestment for rationalization and at the same time must pay special attention to employment problems; the potential for expansion of medium-sized and small businesses which are a source of inno vation and therefore create employment, must be stimulated. 3. The Jumbo Council, which met next on 16 November 1982, discussed three crucial issues: improvement of economic and industrial policy, reduc tion and reorganization of working time and creation of greater employment op portunities for young people. The Commission responded on 10 December 1982 with a 'Memorandum on the reduction and reorganization of working time'. In the light of increasing Copyright REA/D. Maillac 58 ",
        "THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY unemployment, the Commission wished to repeat that the Community should ex pressly support and stimulate a policy in that direction, not only in order to im prove living and working conditions but also as an instrument of social and economic policy. Repeated consultations took place on the basis of this memorandum in the first half of 1983 between the Member States and the social partners. On 16 September 1983, the Commission adopted a draft recommendation by the Council on the subject. This recom mended that the Member States should agree to the following policies: they would promote the introduction of a re duction in the hours worked by individu als and reorganization of the same, to an extent that would stimulate the posi tive development of employment in such a way that both competitiveness and so cial rights would be safeguarded; to li mit systematically paid overtime more stringently and to remunerate necessary overtime in time rather than money. 4. Employers' and employees' organizations reacted immediately to the draft recommendation. While the Employers Liaison Committee pointed out that it was in principle opposed to the introduction of any kind of Commu nity instrument in this area (which it re garded as belonging to the competence of the social partners as part of collec tive bargaining) and disputed whether unemployment could be brought down by measures to reduce and reorganize working time the European Association of Trade Unions felt that reduction of working hours had been and continued to be a significant way of safeguarding existing jobs and making the creation of additional jobs possible. The Commission did everything in its power to bring the two sides of in dustry together at a European level and to get them to come to a gentlemen's agreement. Its efforts were unsuccess ful. At one point, the dialogue broke down completely. The Commission then attempted to win the support of the Council and governments for the draft recommendation on the reduction and reorganization of working time but that failed too. In the absence of unanimity, the draft was not approved. The same fate befell the above draft directives con cerning part-time working and tempo rary work. 5. From mid-1982, the general em ployment situation suddenly deterio rated; unemployment rose to a level which had been considered impossible. Youth unemployment in particular be gan to assume dramatic proportions. More than 4.5 million young people were out of work i.e. 40% of the total number of people unemployed. The un employment percentage among young people was twice the average. Very ur gent measures needed to be taken to deal with this situation. The Commission had pointed this out in the foreword to the five-year medium-term economic policy programme, indicating that in the next five years it would create the nec essary mechanisms and provisions to guarantee all young school-leavers paid employment, vocational training or both at the same time ('social guarantee'). After the Commission had then indi cated a number of special measures in its Communication to the Jumbo Coun cil of 16 November 1982, the latter re cognized that youth unemployment formed one of the major problems re quiring priority treatment. It expressed its deep concern at the employment prospects for young people. The Coun cil repeated its promise that all young people who offered their services on the labour market in the next five years would have the opportunity of taking a vocational training course or having work experience. These proposals prompted the Commission to submit a Communication to the Councl in April 1983 entitled 'Promoting youth employ ment' containing a three-point strategy to combat unemployment: strengthen ing the general strategy to combat un employment, solving the specific and acute problem of youth unemployment; and developing a programme of special measures at national and Community le vel to combat youth unemployment. Five types of measure were pro posed: enlarging employment opportu nities by reducing and reorganizing working time; stimulating employers in the private sector to create new jobs and to employ more young people; helping young people to set up new companies; extending employment out side the market sector; supporting young people by offering improved facil ities to develop interest in them other than purely professional interest. After the Standing Committee for Employment had expressed its full sup port for the Commission's proposals at its meeting of 20 May 1983, the Council adopted a Resolution on the promotion of employment on 23 January 1984. Finally, in this context, the Council adopted a social action programme for the medium term on 22 July 1984, one of the main points of which was youth un employment. 6. As the unemployment situation persisted and deteriorated, another aspect came strongly to the fore; long- term unemployment. Although this is not restricted to young people, there is no doubt that the majority of long-term un employed are young people. In accordance with the request of the Jumbo Council of 16 November 1982, the Commission issued a Com munication on 22 April 1983 on long- term unemployment, pointing out that general measures to stimulate employ ment or traditional training courses did little to help the long-term unemployed. The Commission wished to help such people primarily through the European Social Fund, particularly with financial support, by developing specific forms of retraining and by making funds available to create jobs in the collective services sector. The Council accepted a Resolu tion on 13 December 1984 on combat ing long-term unemployment, 7. On 21 November 1983, in accord ance with the request of the Council contained in its resolution of 12 July 1982, the Commission sent a Communi cation to the Council on the contribution made by local job creation schemes to combatting unemployment. More and more emphasis was placed on the role small-scale, local activities could play in the fight against unemployment. This 59 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE Copyright REA/D. Maillac Communication rounded off two years of work and gave an overview of the re sults and conclusions of 20 consulta tions at local level within the Commu nity. On 7 June the Council approved a Resolution in which it noted that the 'de velopment of these schemes must be supported and stimulated by policy measures on the part of the Member States, which must in turn be accom panied by specific measures at Com munity level; the latter must include sup port for innovation projects by develop ing a programme of consultation and transfer of information and by undertak ing studies.' 8. The employment problem and the tensions on the labour market have nat urally focused the attention of public opinion on foreign workers. Since the approval by the Council on 9 February 1976 of a Resolution and a 'Programme of action for the benefit of migrant work ers and their families' and a number of measures aimed at these people in the field of social security, no Community in itiative had been taken in the field of so cial security for their benefit. We should not lose sight of the fact that there are at present 12 million migrant workers in the Community, 9 million of whom are from third countries. The question was asked in various Member States whether in view of un employment and the economic situa tion, restrictions on migrant workers liv ing and working in the Community would be justified and to what extent mi grant workers in the Community should be encouraged to return to their country of origin. Other questions raised fo cused on the efforts needed to integrate migrant minorities socially and culturally, particularly members of second or third generations in the host country. As these questions have an important poli tical dimension, the Council noted in the Community medium-term social action programme adopted on 22 June 1984 that the Commission would submit proposals on this subject. The Commis sion accordingly submitted a Memoran dum on migrant policy to the Council on 7 March 1985 and the Council adopted a Resolution on the subject on 16 July 1985. 9. As far as vocational training is concerned, the Council adopted two Resolutions at the request of the Com mission, one on 2 June 1983 on 'Voca tional training in the new information technologies' and a second on 11 July 1983 on 'Vocational training policy in the European Community in the 1980s'. In addition, the Commission pub lished a Communication on 'Develop- 60 ",
        "THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ments in technology and social change' on 26 January 1984. After wide-ranging discussions in the Standing Committee on Employment on 10 May 1984, the Council of 7 June 1984 stated in its con clusions that a common strategy on the influence of the new technologies in the social field must be based on a number of individual principles, among others that a comprehensive Community re sponse must be found to meet the chal lenge of the new industrial revolution and its social consequences. Finally, on 18 April 1985, the Commis sion launched the Comett programme of instruction and training in technology, in which cooperation between the uni versities and industry is central and which attempts to do for human re- souces what Community programmes such as Esprit do in other fields, namely combining research and development activities. The Council approved the pro gramme on 5 December 1985. It runs for four years (1986\u201489) and its aims in clude support for initiatives taken at the national level relating to research and development in the new information technology. Point (b) A third review of the European So cial Fund took place in 1983. As the in struments available to the Fund and the financial resources allocated to it were no longer appropriate to the social and economic situation which had deve loped since 1979, both the Commission and the Member States felt a strong need to revise the Fund's rules and to bring them more effectively into line with the labour situation in the Community, which had undergone substantial struc tural change. Although every Council Decision tends to be a compromise, it established more clearly on this occa sion the activities in which the Fund can participate, the groups of potential beneficiaries and how the available re sources should be divided up. Since that time, the Commission has taken de cisions autonomously. With the excep tion of super regions (Mezzogiorno in Italy, the Irish Republic, Northern Ire land, the French Overseas Departments and, since 1981, the whole of Greece), for which 40% of the Fund's resources are reserved, it now decides the eligible areas on an independent basis and to a certain extent chooses the fields of work in which resources are to be channelled. The general rule is that the ESF's contribution may not exceed that of gov ernment with a maximum of 50% of the declarable cost (55% for the super-re gions). A contribution by government is therefore a pre-condition for a grant from the Fund. In view of the large numbers of un employed young people, 75% of the Fund's resources are for measures within the context of the labour market for young people under the age of 25, particularly those whose opportunities for finding work are extremely limited; the remaining 25% may be spent to benefit the following groups: long-term unemployed, women who wish to return to employment, disabled people who can be absorbed into the labour pro cess, migrant workers and their families, people who for technical reasons need to be retrained and are working in med ium-sized and small businesses, people who will be working as training instruc tors experts in the field of careers infor mation and development consultants. 1984 was the first year in which the reformed Social Fund became fully op erational. More than 500 million units of account went to young people under 25 in the less-favoured regions and more than 900 million units of account in the other regions, in other words a total of more than 1 400 million units of account of a total of 1 860 million units of ac count. Geographically speaking, 32% went to the UK, 22% to Italy, 12% to Ire land, 11 % to France and 5% to Greece. Point (c) As far as social security is con cerned, it should first be noted that since 1982, the Commission has insti tuted a complete reappraisal of the role and the place of social security in the context of socio-economic policy as a whole. As early as 1975, as a result of the Council's Resolution of 2' January 1974 on a social action programme, the Commission decided to set up two con sultative bodies: one consisting of Di rectors-General of social security in the Member States and a second consist ing of independent experts. Both groups then monitored developments in the Member States closely, exchanged views and advised the Commission on policy to be pursued in this field. For some years, the social security systems have been confronted with ma jor problems. On the one hand, incomes are declining (fewer people are in work as a result of the recession and the slowing down of economic growth) and on the other expenditure is increasing sharply (rise in unemployment benefits, increasing costs of health care, ageing of the population etc.). In addition, it has constantly been pointed out that where social security Is financed to a large ex tent by employers' and employees' con tributions, labour-intensive companies and industries are at a disadvantage and this does not help reduce unem ployment. The way in which social secu rity is financed therefore needs to be re examined. Finally there is the demogra phic factor: the birth rate in western Eu rope has declined dramatically since 1967/68. How will pensions and other benefits be financed in future if this trend continues and the ratio between working and non-working population deteriorates even further? The Commission indicated the need to deal with this problem at Community level in a draft communication of 17 No vember 1982 entitled 'Social security problems \u2014 Matters for consideration' in which a number of changes were pro posed. These included checking the rise in expenditure on social security, particularly in the health care sector, re viewing the method of financing social security (with the objective of achieving a better balance between income from contributions and tax revenue and en suring that the financing system does not have negative consequences for the structure of production and employ ment) and promoting greater efficiency in the social security system. It was intended that this communica tion should be discussed widely by Community institutions and in the Mem ber States. This is in fact what hap- 61 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE pened. Meetings of experts on social security were organized in the various Member States and consultative meet ings of government representatives were organized at Community level. A list of priorities was to be drawn up on the basis of what was discussed which should then have to be explored in greater detail at Community level and formed the basis for specific action at Community level or by the Member States. The Commission decided in 1985 to issue a second communication on the problem of social security, taking into account all the discussions which had taken place since its first notification of 17 November 1982. The considerable increase in the number of people living below the pov erty line caused by the persistent level of unemployment promoted the Council on 19 December 1984 to adopt a new specific Community measure to combat poverty which provides for financial sup port from the Community for the accom plishment of a number of research pro jects the main aim of which is to help combat poverty among the unemployed and more particularly young people and the long-term unemployed, second-gen eration migrants, refugees and migrants wishing to return to their country of ori gin as well as among elderly people and single-parent families. Point (d) As far as the programme concerning health and safety at work is concerned, as a follow-up to the framework Direc tive of 27 November 1980 on the protec tion of employees against harmful expo sure to chemical, physical and biologi cal substances at work, the Commis sion submitted five draft Directives con cerned with the danger of metallic lead, exposure to asbestos, excessive noise at work, specific dangerous substances and activities and exposure to benzene. The first three have already been ap proved by the Council. The Council also approved a basic directive on the prevention of serious accidents in relation to industrial activi ties, the so-called Seveso Directive, crowning lengthy efforts on the part of the Commission. On 4 November 1982, the Commis sion submitted a draft Resolution to the Council concerning a second pro gramme of action on safety and health at work. The programme was adopted by the Council on 27 February 1984. It runs until 1988 and is designed to in crease the protection of employees at work by means of 20 priority measures. In practice it will affect approximately 100 million employees in the Commu nity. D. Conclusion To summarize, between 1973 and 1977, the social policy of the Community was a great success, particularly as a result of the adoption and Implementa tion of a large number of the measures contained in the 1974 action pro gramme. The period 1977\u201480 was more difficult as the economic tide had turned by then. There were however, significant achievements during this pe riod: the reform of the European Social Fund to enable it to be used to create jobs for young people and the broad discussion, initiated and stimulated by the Community, on the redistribution of available work. However, attempts to achieve a breakthrough at Community level failed. Even in the period 1981\u201485 there was no Community breakthrough in this field. However, it is to be hoped that the third attempt will be 'third-time lucky'. The new Commission under Mr Delors took up the theme again in early 1985. On 31 January and 12 November 1985, the leaders of the employers' and em ployees' organizations in Europe were invited to informal talks at Val Duchesse in Brussels. It would appear that possi bilities none the less exist for a positive exchange of views between the ETUC and UNICE in a number of fields (the la bour market and the organization and redistribution of work on the one hand and the introduction of new technolo gies on the other). This would help to reactivate the social dialogue which, since mid-1983, has been very sub dued. It should also be noted that, unlike the previous committee, the Monet II Committee which began its work in Bonn on 6 June 1985, consists of em ployers' representatives in addition to representatives of the main political groupings and employees. It is to be hoped that both attempts will succeed and will breathe new life into the social dialogue, a dialogue which in the past has been very benefi cial to the Community. The Community has enough problems as it is at present. We must be careful not to lose the sup port which the Community enjoys among major sections of the population thanks to the social partners.

        "Managing change: employment practices in US and European firms Both the US and Europe are go ing through periods of rapid struc tural change. How have firms ad justed to these changes? How and what can firms learn from the expe riences of others? The Commission together with the United States Industry Coordi nating Group 1 organized a seminar in Bruges on 15\u201416 May 1986 to talk about these questions. Partici pants included representatives from US companies, European affil iates of US companies, European companies, the services of the Eu ropean Commission, the European Parliament, UNICE, the Economic and Social Committee, the OECD, the ILO and universities. John Morley, head of the Com mission's employment and labour market policy division and Charles Goldman, chairman of USICG acted as co-chairmen for the seminar. Both the presentations and the dis cussions concentrated on ex changes of information about prac tical experiences of managing change rather than on theoretical issues. Despite the diversity of the cases presented, a common thread throughout the seminar was that of new technology in the largest sense\u2014not only new technology applied in the traditional, produc tive sphere but also in the social sense: 'new technologies' of com munication and management. This article gives brief outlines of the presentations which were made in the course of the three sessions and indi cates some initial reactions and areas for future work. Mr Bruno Liebhaberg welcomed par ticipants on behalf of Commission Pre sident Jacques Delors. Mr Liebhaberg recalled that the major priorities of the Delors Commission were the comple tion of the internal market by 1992, grea ter economic and social cohesion and closer technological and industrial cooperation with the aim of reducing un employment. To achieve these ends consensus is necessary and this is why the Commission launched its coopera tive growth strategy in last year's Annual Economic Report. The aim of this coop erative growth strategy is to increase employment \u2014 generating growth by encouraging real wage growth which is lower than productivity gains while at the same time supporting demand so that job creating investment will be pro moted. Both sides of industry have en dorsed this strategy. Mr Liebhaberg said that the seminar, which provided a meeting place for Americans and Europeans, was fully in keeping with the wider industrial coop eration between countries which the Commission feels is necessary. 'Competitive needs and planning for change within the company: growth, reduction' The first session contained four case studies dealing with the problems of labour force reductions, plant closures, transfers of activities and personnel to different geographical areas as well as changes in labour force composition \u2014 e.g. upgrading the technical capabilities of staff in line with technology changes. Canadian General Electric set up a new high-technology plant in Bromont, Quebec, an area with a long history of traditional and declining industries, and a labour force with out-dated skills. The plant is now the most productive operation within CGE and probably the most productive of its type in the world. This success can be attributed to the in novative approach to management. Em ployees, who are provided with an Inten sive training programme, work in teams with a high degree of responsibility. There are no foremen or first line man agers and employees are free to make proposals for change, and evaluate their own productivity. Salaries reflect pro ductivity improvements and cost reduc tions. The philosophy of the company is that each employee can make a positive contribution to the company in an envir onment which is conducive to initiative and creativity and where training is para mount. Allied Signal Corporation, a produ cer of automobile and aeronautic com ponents were forced to close large man ufacturing units in Indiana as a result of international competition. The firm con sulted the highly unionized workforce at an early stage and investigated the fail ures and successes of other firms who had also experienced mass lay-offs. By deciding to close production completely, rather than cutting product lines here and there, the company man aged to save the jobs of the technical and administrative personnel (50% of the original 5 000 workforce) and could introduce major employee assistance programmes. The company provided substantial compensation to the employees and also set up a transition centre. This pro vided training in drafting CVs and prep- 1 The United States Industry Coordinating Group comprises: the United States Council for Inter national Business; the National Foreign Trade Council; the National Association of Manufac turers; the United States Chamber ol Com merce and the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium.

        "SOCIAL EUROPE aration for job interviews with use of videos and films. A computerized job matching and placements service to gether with counselling to help workers deal with sudden unemployment and early retirement was also provided. Dow Chemical automated an old- fashioned plant in Terneuzen, the Netherlands. Communication with and involvement of all the employees con cerned were key factors in ensuring a smooth transition. Delegation of deci sion-making, widespread dissemination of information, introduction of more flexi ble working time and training pro grammes to encourage job flexibility and multi-craft employees have led to a strengthened company which now em ploys more people than before the change. Some of the original employees took early retirement but none were made redundant and many have up graded their skill level through training. ICI petrochemicals and plastics divi sions found themselves in dire trouble at the beginning of the 1980s, with heavy losses and over-capacity. Be tween 1981 and 1983 the workforce was reduced from 18 500 to 12 500 and the company's research and development operations moved from the south of England to the production site in the north. Yet of the 6 000 who lost their jobs, only 100 ended up as unem ployed. How was this achieved? After lay-offs in 1971 which had un settled the remaining staff, the company introduced a 'Security of Employment' charter which stated that any labour force changes should have a business justification and be fully discussed with the employees. Attempts should be made to redeploy any displaced em ployees within ICI, first locally, then na tionally. Where this is impossible, the company should help in redeploying personnel outside the company. To cope with cutting the workforce so drastically, ICI set up a range of re settlement activities which included: (1) Counselling sessions to help em ployees with interviews and CVs for new jobs; (2) Job search; (3) Secondment to job creation schemes in local communities; (4) Retraining of employees; (5) Training employees to set up their own businesses; 66 ",

Frequent and early consultations with employees helped them under stand the need for change and facili tated management of the change. 'Competitive needs, change and innovative resources management within the company: job creation' The second session contained four case studies, two dealing with the prob lems of rapid labour force growth, one with deregulation and the fourth with reorganization of working time. DHL provides an international cou rier service for parcels and mail. Opera tions started in Amsterdam and London in 1976 with a staff of five and a couple of old cars. Ten years later there are 2 700 employees. The company has succeeded in expanding rapidly with no corporate strategy or planning. Key fac tors have been young, flexible person nel who have been willing to pack their bags and go to set up new offices with little capital and a try-fail-correct-try again philosophy. The average age of employees is 27, of whom 40% are women. Shift systems have been set up to keep offices open 24 hours a day and part-time workers and others on fixed- term contracts are used to supplement the full-time labour force at peak periods \u2014 for example, from October to Decem ber. DHL has also introduced a system for individuals in more far-flung places to set up their own business under a DHL licence. Sun Microsystems produces high performance computer systems. Created in 1982 by four young people (average age 26), turnover reached USD 8 million in the first year and this year its 2 000 staff are expected to produce a turnover of USD 200 million. Employees are highly qualified, own shares in the firm and are allowed to work flexibly \u2014 many working from home with only oc casional visits to the office. Employees work in an entrepreneurial, participative environment where authority is based more on technical competence rather than management position. Sun survived the recent recession in the computer industry. Rather than lay off workers, employees agreed to a tem porary hiring freeze, to increasing pro ductivity and to a reduction in profits. Those workers who failed to reach per formance targets were counselled and, in the end, only 10 people had to be laid off. Sun's reputation as a good em ployer encourages larger numbers of applications. Recruitment is currently running at 7% of the workforce every month. An expected turnover of USD 400-USD 700 million by 2000 with be tween 3 000 and 8 000 employees will mean management may have to be come more structured and variable compensation schemes are being con sidered. Nevertheless, Sun hopes to protect its philosophy of treating people as its primary resource. Deregulation of the road transport sector The third case study looked at the effects of the 1980 deregulation of the trucking industry. In the regulated indus try, new entrants had to prove that they would not damage other business inter ests in the industry. In the deregulated world, the onus is now on existing firms to prove that the new entrant to the in dustry would have definite harmful ef fects on the community. Potential loss of income to their company from outside competition is no longer accepted as a valid argument. Deregulation was followed by a mas sive increase in licence applications. The number of carriers rose from 17 000 in 1978 to 33 500 in 1985. The very large firms tended to survive deregulation but many medium-sized firms were under cut by the increasing number of small firms and went bankrupt. Thus, there were direct dislocation costs for the industry itself. Consumers, however, found prices falling and more diversified services with faster delivery options and so on. The share of freight and invento ries in GNP has fallen and it is estimated that there have been overall savings in logistics costs of many billions of dol lars. It is difficult to estimate the employ ment effects of deregulation independ ently of the cyclical position of the econ omy, but they are generally regarded as positive. Although salaries have tended to fall, more and more employees are taking advantage of employee share ownership plans. The general feeling seems to be that deregulation has been a good move. Philips Belgium laid off over 9 000 workers between 1974 and 1982 as a re sult of international competition. To sur vive as a going concern for the remain ing workforce, the company reorganized working time to increase production ca pacity by allowing longer use of equip ment. The company was stimulated in its efforts by the 'Hansenne' experi ments' whereby regulations governing evening and weekend employment, overtime etc. were relaxed for those companies who engaged new person nel, reduced labour hours and moder ated wages. The new working arrange ments at Philips include paying weekly salaries and benefits to workers working two 12-hour days at the weekend. Philips has also made increasing use of part-time workers and workers on fixed term contracts to allow production to vary in response to demand. Although the proposed changes met with some initial hostility from the unions, it has now been agreed that the company can modify the work schedules of new employees in accord ance with the needs of the company. The plant is now in operation, on av erage, by 12% longer than before and employment has increased. Philips be lieves that the Hansenne experiments have played a vital role in introducing the concept of flexible working hours and labour organization. 1 Hansenne is the Belgian Labour Minister who introduced the schemes. 67 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE 'Competitive needs, change: impact and external considerations' The third session looked at links outside industry: public/private partner ships; university-industry links; and in dustry involvement in social/employ ment programmes. Deutsche Bank, Berlin, has been very involved in helping Berlin develop as a centre for technological innovation. With a student population of 90 000 and one of the first science parks with over 180 research and development centres, Berlin had considerable potential. How ever, 100 000 manufacturing jobs had been lost between 1970 and 1983 and the Government decided to step in to halt the employment decline. A series of innovatory schemes included: a public venture capital fund; creating an incuba tor centre for new businesses at the heart of Berlin's University of Technical Sciences; and a 'qualification offensive' which provided unemployed people with training in private enterprises. Links between the universities and the business community have improved greatly: Curricula have been changed to meet the needs of industry; people work both as university lecturers and busi nessmen; businesses send more of their employees on university courses; research is more market oriented and the opportunities for product develop ment and production are increasing. 300 new companies specializing in new technology have been established over the last five years and large com panies have also become involved, e.g. Volkswagen and BMW have a joint pro ject to stimulate technological innova tion in the car industry. Deutsche Bank has employed non- traditional criteria in assessing bank loans and has a special team for as sessing loans to new businesses. It has also specialized in providing financial and marketing advice to technologically innovative firms. Cooperation between governmental bodies, industry, and the university has led to the creation of 9 000 new jobs since 1984, and Berlin's economic growth is now higher than in the rest of West Germany. Nobel Prize laureate Dr Kenneth Wil son from Cornell University explained how he had set up the Cornell Univer sity Theory Center/Supercomputer Fa cility. Several years ago, Dr Wilson real ized that existing array processors were not powerful enough to handle his spe cific research problems in elementary particle physics. Realizing that other users both in business and other re- Copyright REA/C. Weiss 68 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IN US AND EUROPEAN FIRMS search disciplines faced similar prob lems, Dr Wilson sought financial and technical partners to develop supercom puters. IBM agreed to provide both technical and financial backing to the tune of USD 35 million over three years. The National Science Foundation contri buted USD 21 million and the State of New York, USD 12 million. The develop ers of the orginal array processors 'Floating point systems', also collabo rated. Such industry/university collabor ation benefits both partners. Industry generally seeks reliability in its compu ters and technological progress tends to be slow. Academics, on the other hand, re quire fast, innovative computers. With cooperation, university users can help develop more complex, efficient compu ters and the computer industry provides reliable technical and production sup port. At Cornell, costs are further spread by charging research institute members USD 100 000 for use of the supercom puter facilities which would otherwise be out of their reach. Dr Wilson suggested that in future, a major funding pool should be established by governments, universities, and industry to ensure that advanced instrumentation is developed to its full potential. IBM, in common with many big com panies, spends large amounts of money each year on social programmes. One of the projects in the United States is a network of Job Training Centres which provide training for the unemployed or underemployed and other disadvan taged groups. The aim of the centres is to teach marketable skills wnich are relevant to the needs of the local labour market. Local community organizations and industry are involved in running the centres and providing additional finan cial support. There are now over 140 centres across the United States and since 1968 14 000 people have graduated \u2014 80% of those who enrolled \u2014 and 85\u201490% of graduates have gained good jobs. IBM spends USD 4.5 million a year on this project but estimates the net gain to the public in terms of cuts in benefit payments, increase in income and taxes generated is over USD 30 mil lion. The involvement of local people in design and maintenance of the schemes has been crucial in determin ing their success. The seminar was considered suc cessful by all participants. A number of impressions stand out: (1) A lot is going on in the employment and industrial relations areas within large companies. Policy approaches have become extremely sophisti cated in both heavily unionized and non-unionized companies. (2) In terms of management objectives, the companies seem very con cerned with the morale and motiva tion of their personnel. Career plan ning, training and development of the capabilities of all members of the labour force is highly developed. Good internal communications and involvement of all levels of person nel in decision-making are seen as crucial. (3) Business, universities and local communities are cooperating more closely and in new ways to provide innovative solutions to competitive and social needs. (4) A flexible organization, capable of adapting to change was important in all companies \u2014 unionized and non-unionized. This flexibility ap plied equally to management and workers. There \u00a1s a growing tend ency for employees to work in teams with responsibility for setting and achieving their own production targets. Future seminars, perhaps with more limited themes, are being discussed and the possibility of setting up an infor mation network on 'best practices' in companies is being considered. 69 ",
        "Technology agreements in Japan: The unions are becoming more concerned about the employment effects of new technologies The attitude of Japanese trade unions towards technological inno vation is one of positive accept ance, in spite of some differences in the past between the two main worker organizations (the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Japanese Confederation of Labour): the established pattern of industrial relations, based on coop eration between labour and man agement, and a very low unemploy ment rate have certainly helped to emphasize the growth potentials of technological change, rather than its labour displacement effects. However, some changes in trade union strategy seem to be now tak ing place, and some preoccupa tions and demands similar to those put forward by the trade unions in Europe are emerging in the policies of the labour unions and in the agreements concluded at enter prise level. A report prepared for the Com mission by a Japanese expert, Mr Koichi Mo of the Japan Economic Research Centre, gives an account of these recent changes in attitude, and provides some examples of agreements at firm level in new technology sectors. 1 The growing preoccupation about the consequences of new technologies is attributed by the report to the aware ness that the employment situation is deteriorating at macroeconomic level: the unemployment rate reached 3.1 % in March 1986, which looks high to Japa nese eyes, even if it does not to Euro pean ones. Moreover, the polarization of the labour market is being accentuated by technological change, with the sec ondary segments of the workforce, such as older workers, women and part- timers being more and more relegated to unskilled and menial jobs. Finally, trade unions are losing members, 2 which is a reason for concern not only for the unions themselves, but also for management, in so far as this develop ment may affect the stability of labour- management relations. The macroeconomic dimension is rather important: many studies and re search on the effects of technological change on employment and working conditions missed out the whole pic ture, since little or no labour displace ment occurs in the large enterprises, where new technology is introduced on a piecemeal basis and where the pat tern of labour management is such that surplus workers are reallocated in- house to other tasks. However, the large number of small-scale enterprises is facing more fundamental problems of survival, in so far as their process of automation from their present techno logical level requires a substantial in crease in the capital equipment per worker, and thus a large amount of in vestment. Their ability to survive will eventually be an important determinant of employment levels. Something is changing also in the labour market at enterprise level: firms faced with tougher competition are in duced to abolish, to some extent, their permanent employment and seniority systems, while computer engineers show less commitment to lifetime em ployment with the same firm than is nor mally the case in the core labour market in Japan. The response of the trade unions, still in a framework of global acceptance of the adoption of microelectronics tech nology, is to define guidelines at na tional level on two main issues, i.e. the definition of desirable and undesirable applications of information technology; and the necessary changes to be imple mented at the workshop level in relation to technological change. A national ap proach is demed necessary, since these issues could hardly be tackled at the level of individual enterprises. Proposals on the content of collec tive agreements at sectoral level have already been put forward by some un ions, such as the Japanese Federation of Electrical Machine Workers Unions and the Japanese Metal Industry Work ers Union. The proposals are based upon the precondition that management should not dismiss workers because of the introduction of microelectronics technology, and they fix a number of guidelines on safety standards, the re quired agreement of the workers who should be reassigned to other jobs, the provision of adequate opportunities to participate in education and training ac tivities, the maintenance or improvement of working conditions. As far as proce dures are concerned, the union should obtain information on employer's plans as early as possible and have a first dis cussion with management; then consult its members; and finally come up with a set of demands emerging from the con sultation of the workers to proceed to collective bargaining. Of the two unions, the Federation of Electrical Machine Workers Unions stresses the equitable sharing of the ad vantages of technological development, i.e. that greater productivity should be used for reducing working hours, im proving working conditions, and main taining the human aspects of work. Ad verse effects should be prevented, and the introduction of the new equipment 1 Koichi lio, 'Introduction of new technology and labour-management relations'; report prepared for the Commission of the European Communi ties, mimeo, 1986. a The rate of unionization has declined to less than 30%. 70 ",
        "TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS IN JAPAN should not be accepted if it may pro duce direct negative effects on employ ment. Prior consultation procedures should be established, and the introduc tion should not be accepted until they are completed. The Japanese Metal In dustry Workers Union, while putting for ward similar principles, stresses the aspects of planning and consultation, requesting the companies to present medium- and long-term production and labour force plans for consultation, which is equally requested for any re allocation of the workers to different job assignments. Clauses concerning the internal mobility of workers and the reabsorption of workers displaced by the technology in other departments are important in the platforms of both unions, as well as all related clauses on how to smooth the transfer, i.e. training courses, the improvement of skills, and some guarantees for the workers most difficult to retrain. Making full use of already employed workers and moving them to new tasks is common practice in Japanese firms: in one of the companies quoted in the report 500 employees (out of a total of 3 600) have been reshuffled each year since 1978 and 14% of the total workers are annually placed in new positions. Moreover, the positions of at least the largest companies are not in sharp con flict with union demands. A significant example which may be quoted is that of a note jointly signed by the automobile company Nissan and the Motor Trade Union in connection with the introduc tion of automated labour saving equip ment. In this document, the company and the union undertake to make efforts to introduce new technology smoothly on a joint basis, and to consult with each other with a collaborative attitude. The company undertakes to present its plan, including the expected effects on the workers; it also undertakes to main tain the current employment level and working conditions. The reassignment of workers following the introduction of new equipment will be done by fully tak ing into consideration the abilities of in dividual workers, and will provide them with adequate opportunities of educa tion and training.

        "New production systems: Implications for work and work organization in the factory of the future A Conference on new forms of production was organized jointly by FAST, Cedefop and the City Council of Torino. 1 It referred to issues of technology, organization, small and medium-sized enterprises, and their implications for long-term oriented aspects of work and training as well as for research and development demands. The conference was held in the framework of a research ac tivity of the FAST programme (Fore casting and assessment in science and technology), DG XII of the Commission of the European Com munities, and was co-sponsored by Cedefop (Berlin). The main task of FAST is to ana lyse scientific and technical change in its many dimensions \u2014 econ omic, social and political \u2014 so as to identify new priorities for a com mon R&D policy and for long-term action in the Community. In addi tion, FAST aims to strengthen the bases of European forecasting and forward thinking by exploiting long- term research undertaken in the Member States and encouraging the setting-up of ad hoc coopera tion networks between researchers and potential users. In the framework of robots and new production systems, research studies have been carried out by IREP (Grenoble), ISI (Karlsruhe), ISF (Munich) and the University of Ros kilde addressing the question of the consequences new information technologies and their potential flexibility and integration of the pro duction process might have on work and training. The research has concentrated on the so-called flexi ble manufacturing systems (FMS). At the symposium discussion cen tred on the results and comparisons carried out by an international audience of 150 experts from all member coun tries. Over 40 contributions were re ceived referring to the questions: (i) To what extent will development lead to full automation and compu ter integration? (ii) Do computer-based highly inte grated production systems lead to more flexibility, or will this aspect mainly be ensured by human quali fications and work organization? (iii) Which new man/machine relation ship will arise? (iv) Which measures have to be taken to meet future requirements? This article will present the results of the discussion which took place in the working party on 'Organizational factors of production, work organization and division of work'. Highlights of the discussion of the working party on Organizational factors of production, work organization and division of work' The discussion revolved principally around flexible machining systems \u2014 specifically, metal cutting \u2014 for small and medium batch sizes. The chief conclusions were: (i) the quickening pace at which flexi ble manufacturing systems (flexible cells and small flexible workshops) have spread since the early 1980s has been a cause of deep-reaching changes not only to the machining process but also in the general operation of the businesses con cerned (particularly in the mechani cal engineering industry); (ii) for the most part, the introduction of flexible cells and workshops repre sents an extension of numerically- controlled machine tools, and more strictly reflects a search for produc tivity gains rather than for the ability to achieve maximum product diver sity from a single production line; (iii) case studies reveal no causative link between technology and work organization: the existence of a marked or weak division of labour is determined less by technological demands than by existing labour uti lization practices at plant and indus try level. These conclusions were the out come of an engrossing, often impas sioned, debate in which some 50 partici pants were actively involved, and which revolved around a handful of contribu tions of particular interest. The automation of machining in Denmark, France and the Federal Republic of Germany (M. Hollard - IREP, Grenoble) Profound changes were observable in the companies studied in all three countries, beginning in the late 1970s and gathering pace in recent years. In novations in metal cutting were less re lated to machining techniques in the narrow sense than to loading, fixing and unloading workpieces, linking the ma chines together, production scheduling and management, part engineering, quality control, and machine supervisory techniques ... The first major changes were necessitated by the introduction of numerical control techniques, which are now fairly commonplace. The spread of flexible cells and workshops is essen tially an extension of numerical control. The situation, however, presents a very different picture depending upon the size and complexity of the system used; a trend towards standardization using equipment selected from manufacturers' catalogues is now beginning to emerge for basic, two-machine systems.

        "NEW PRODUCTION SYSTEMS A flexible machining system is not a flexible manufacturing system. The sur veys conducted in Denmark lead to the conclusion that manufacturers see the ability to respond rapidly to demands for new products and the installation of integrated automated production sys tems as irreconcilable opposites. Flexi ble cells and workshops in France and Germany have by and large simply re placed numerically-controlled machine tool workshops. The conclusion is that what is being sought here is simply in creased productivity rather than 'econ omy of scope'. This apparent paradox seems to stem from a degree of confusion as to what 'flexible automation' actually means: (i) Computer control of a manufactur ing line does not, of itself, diversify the range of parts that line can pro duce. On the contrary, it actually re stricts the range of operations to those which the computer can be programmed to handle. The diver sity of products which can be manu factured depends first and foremost on the type of machines used. Com puters offer a twofold benefit: they enhance productivity, and they can control highly complex systems. In this case, the scope of new pro ducts which can be manufactured can only be widened where the manufacturing system is already au tomated, but it is a situation in which the integration of machines itself creates severe rigidities. A careful distinction must therefore be drawn between automation by linking to gether what were previously 'stand alone' machines and the host of changes needed to transfer lines (constitution of 'just-in-case' stocks, the potential for changing the se quence of operations ...) to enable them to widen the scope of their production potential. (ii) The concept of flexible automation also embraces the ability of a sys tem to change from working one product to another over longer peri ods. Here, the flexibility is linked to the type and cost of changes needed. Major advances are being made in this field, particularly with the development of CAD techniques and just-in-time process control. The spread of flexible manufacturing systems is only very loosely con nected with this kind of flexibility. An examination of the educational qualifications of workers responsible for flexible cells and workshops reveals a wide variety of forms of division of la bour among companies, at the core of which is a general trend towards higher Copyright REA/D.

        "SOCIAL EUROPE levels of qualification, to which the size of training programmes, in particular, bears witness. The situation in Germany is divided along broadly equal lines be tween robotic installations with a marked division of labour and others where a higher degree of versatility is required from operators. It would there fore appear that the rising levels of qual ifications are not necessarily causally re lated to the technical characteristics of the system installed. Other factors must also be taken into account, such as company policy, established demarca tions within the workshop which may also exist in other parts of the factory, and the power relationships between the various occupational groups con cerned. All these findings point to the need for a comprehensive analysis of the technical and social changes wrought in the workplace. The reason for the wide variations between the situations in dif ferent companies is a question which must be addressed. The first point to emphasize is that the differences are heightened because virtually all the companies involved are very much feel ing their way gingerly through an experi mental stage; as yet, therefore, the nec essary distance for a satisfactory analy sis is lacking. An initial informed guess, however, might be that the differences in question stem to a large extent from fac tors internal to the companies and that the differences between firms are more marked than those between countries. That, at least, is the general impression which emerges from the comparisons of French and German firms. Account must be taken, however, of the fact that those internal factors cannot be separated from the national context. For one thing, the demography of the firms by indus trial sector and size is not identical in the countries studied. And for another, the strength of the various occupational groups within the firms is also condi tioned by national factors, such as the structure of the vocational training sys tem (particularly crucial with regard to operators), the relative industrial clout of the different categories of engineers and system experts, and certain broader cul tural factors. Organizational aspects of FMS in the United Kingdom (B. W. Haywood \u2014 Brighton Polytechnic, Brighton) The conclusions of this British study among 50 manufacturers, trade users, research bodies, and others brought to light a number of prerequisites for the successful implementation of FMC/ FMS: the need to examine the techno logical and organizational structures within the company (around 50% of the benefits of introducing FMC/FMS arise not from the system itself but from a general reappraisal of the organization); the integration of manpower and skill re- sou'ces in the preparation stage, includ ing manpower planning and a less de marcated job structure in the workshop; the fostering of closer industry/univers ity cooperation and the promotion of cross-disciplinary research on systems and engineering aspects; the establish ing of closer links between companies and their sub-contractors, and the de velopment of a new form of 'compatibil ity' between the organization of produc tion and the organization of work (as ex emplified by 'just-in-time' deliveries). Flexible manufacturing systems and work organization (A. Rosenvallon - IREP, Grenoble) This piece of research into the French situation concludes: (i) with regard to job content, that the ideas of the 'polarization of skills' and 'the workerless factory' are not borne out by the case studies; what they do reveal, in contrast, is the in creasing complexity of the opera tives' work ('new mental stress' \u2014 classifying, ranking and retrieving data) and the need for more collec tive management of work activities: (ii) that there exists a great diversity of forms of work organization: it finds 'no strict determinism between tech nology and modes of work organiza tion'. The case study does, however, reveal a high degree of division of labour/functional specialization and a hierarchy of skill levels within the work teams in the workshop, des pite a general tendency towards 'up- skilling'; additionally, the workshops are only relatively autonomous, with maintenance and programming being done outside the workshop; methods of work organization tend to develop over time: after a period of years the relative autonomy of workshop teams becomes more firmly established; leadership and supervisory tasks are redistributed and carried out by the workers more capable of managing the flow of in formation; and lastly, there is a gen eral increase in flexibility, flowing outwards from the workshop to change the work organization of the company as a whole. The present state and development tendencies of FMS and FMC in the Federal Republic of Germany (J. Fix-Sterz, G. Lay, R. Schultz-Wild - ISI, Karlsruhe and ISF, Munich) This study analyses the installation of 85 FMC/FMS systems in the Federal Republic. The predominant objective was found to be automation (85% of the systems surveyed were introduced to achieve productivity gains). The authors also found a marked trend towards the installation of flexible cells and small flexible workshops (no more than five machines) particularly since 1983, an in creasing use of shiftwork (two \u2014 and in creasingly, three \u2014 shifts), but no ident ifiable causality between technology and work organization. Methods of work organization are classified as being based on a strong or weak division of labour. In the former, different tasks are performed by different workers: opera tor, pallet loader, team leader, etc.; while in the latter, the operator is responsible for the immediate machining functions \u2014 machine loading and unloading, to changing, supervision and/or gauging, minor repairs, machining tests and qual ity control. Their analysis reveals that 56% of the systems studied are based on strong job demarcation. This fairly equal balance between the two forms of division of labour suggests that work or- 74 ",

Maillac ganization is conditioned less by tech nological imperatives than by esta blished labour deployment practices in the companies and industries con cerned. Technological projects and organizational changes. The dissolution of strategies and structures in Danish firms working towards flexible specialization (P. H. Kristensen, Roskilde University, Roskilde) The particular interest of this contri bution lies in its setting of the technol ogy/organization ontology against the wider backdrop of an industrial econ omy confronted with the choice be tween two fundamental models: neo- Fordism and flexible specialization.' Kristensen portrays neo-Fordism as a form of mass production in which the re sponse to competitive pressure is to re duce production costs. The strategy of flexible specialization, in contrast, seeks to avoid price competition by continually shifting to the production of batches of specialized goods catering to changing market niches. Flexibly specialized firms aim for the capacity to produce the wid est possible range of products at any given time \u2014 but particularly for the abil ity to switch between specialized pro ducts at will. Flexible specialization ex cludes the use of high-powered ma chines dedicated to a single task; it de mands general-purpose machines op erated by skilled workers, capable of switching between different products at short notice. All of which means that each stage of the manufacturing pro cess retains some autonomy with re spect to the whole. The identifying fea tures of work organization uncer a flexi ble specialization strategy can be summed up as: general-purpose ma chines, qualified workers, and decentral ization. The author postulates that Danish firms are moving along the road to a form of flexible specialization, although as yet no coherent, uniform model typi fying that trend has emerged. He starts not from an analysis of the technical system used, but rather from a consid eration of the firm as a whole, with tech nological change being seen as a con tributory component in the development towards flexible specialization. The question is: to what extent are the tech nical and organizational structures of the firm compatible with the general pat tern? M. Piore and Ch. Sabvel in The second indus trialdivide (Basic Books, New York, 1984). 75 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE He isolates a number factors which he identifies as prime movers behind the trend to flexibility: (i) workers must be sufficiently highly- skilled to be able to cope with pro duct changes at short notice, which may occasionally involve the com plete reorganization of the workshop (transferring machines from one workshop to another, for instance), and be sufficiently well-informed about the company's business for the high degree of autonomy they enjoy not to conflict with the general organization of production; (ii) the established pattern of work or ganization must not be incompatible with the new forms of organization, particularly where influenced by the 'just-in-time' concept. Kristensen places particular empha sis on the importance attached to the continuance of the collective or ganization of labour along the lines of the established Taylorist model, and on the need to master the new technologies in the production shop itself; (iii) consensus between the different groups within the company is a cru cial factor. The build-up of tensions may come to a head in the form of breakdowns in the organizational system, particularly where the con flict involves those groups most ex posed to the new developments: unskilled workers and the lower and middle management often trained on the shop floor. This analysis suggests that one ex planation of why Danish industry offers such a fertile soil for the growth of flexi ble specialization may reside in the rela tionships between the individual and au thority. That so few flexible automation systems are as yet to be found can be explained by the contradiction which currently exists between the potential flexibility of production based on micro- workshops linked by a flexible informa tion system, and the rigidity which would be imposed by integration within automated systems. This is borne out by the author's finding that, since 1979, the spread of numerically controlled ma chine tools has continued far in advance of the increase in the country's robot population. Recommendations In principle, basic choices with re gard to the organization of work and the generation of skills continue to exist un der new technology, and in concrete de tails, they acquire new forms and defini tions. It may even be that the range of choice becomes larger with new tech nology. The crucial problem is therefore not to focus on new consequences of technical change but redefine, discuss and implement organization and skilling options which are not radically new in principle. In the field of research and develop ment this means that in flexible and inte grated manufacturing, organization is a key issue for the future. This has to be taken into account when formulating in dustrial innovation policies and devel oping production technology and manu facturing facilities. R&D policies have not only to rely on 'technocentric' con cepts, which are guided by a develop ment logic of technology. In this way the demands of prospective production might not be met. What is required now is a new R&D approach, which is based on organization and skills for the elabo ration of adapted technologies. On the basis of the working group's discussion and research results the fol lowing recommendations are proposed by the reporter (Prof. T. Charles, North Staffordshire Polytechnic, Stoke-on- Trent) which relate to issues where clear strategic choices are available and to possibilities for future research: (1) FMS, FMC and integrated manufac turing technologies lead to job dis placement; the danger of further marginalization of the labour force indicates a need for new labour mar ket policy initiatives and training Initiatives to promote qualifications for all workers. (2) The new technologies in manufac turing will not be effectively devel oped within the obsolete framework of hierarchic, Tayloristic forms of work organization. The option of rel atively autonomous work groups and project-based or participative forms of organization are more likely to meet enterprise needs for in creased flexibility and a multi-skilled workforce and at the same time re duce worker resistance and in crease joint worker involvement in technological innovation. (3) Participation strategies to be effec tive require shop-floor and trade union involvement in the early stages of system design which is of potential benefit to all the social parties. This entails real influence of all the social parties at the decision stage through appropriate procedu ral and substantive legislation and increased access to information and external expertise. (4) The continued predominance of technicist forms of systems design indicates the need for further re search into the training of engineers and systems designers and possi bly the need for joint research into new technology design and imple mentation involving collaboration between engineers, computer spe cialists and social scientists in order to identify and elaborate the human side of technological change. (5) Developments in FMS/FMC and in tegrated manufacture are still in their infancy and further fundamental re search will be needed into work or ganization and the quality of work as well as relations between enter prises. There is a need to compare research techniques and consider additional research methods to the survey-case-study approach in or der to span the whole process of technological innovation from the early stages of design to post- implementation and identify innova tive forms of work organization. This entails equal research consideration of both the organization of work at the point of production and mana gerial practices in the enterprise as a whole.'

        "New forms of work and activity initiating a new research programme 1 New ways of organizing work in order to adapt to changes in de mand for products and services, different patterns of behaviour and continuous technological develop ment, coupled with worrylngly high unemployment figures, call for a re- evaluation of the labour market and a redefinition of the concept of work. For many people work in the sense of paid full-time employment has lost its original meaning. To gain a better understanding of the changes taking place, the European Foundation initiated in 1985 a research programme on new forms of work and activities. The purpose of this pro gramme is to investigate both the ways in which the labour market is reacting to new conditions and the new forms of work that are evolving, and to measure the social and economic consequences of these developments. New forms of work include employment at home and working at a VDU at a distance from the actual place of employment, i.e. activi ties which have an element of spatial flexibility compared to what were for merly the physically separate worlds of work and home. They also embrace concepts such as weekend work, the 12-hour shift and working 'on-call', which introduce different patterns of time use. Working in isolation at a VDU also comes into this category. Fundamental changes are also tak ing place outside the labour market proper. As it becomes increasingly diffi cult to find paid employment, more and more people are turning towards other types of activity which do not have the same status, e.g. charity work, family welfare work, membership of environ mental action groups, to give but a few examples. In a society where a person's social status has long derived from the type of work he or she did, such activi ties merit reappraisal. The Foundation has approached the theme of the research from a number of different perspectives. Its aim in so do ing is to come to a broader understand ing of the specific factors typifying the developments outlined above. The work carried out so far encompasses the fol lowing areas: (i) external and internal labour mar kets and job flexibility; (ii) development of job-sharing; (iii) development of terminal/VDU- based work at home; (iv) effects on families and social or ganization; (v) psychological effects of new forms of work and employment; (vi) legal and contractual aspects on the limitations of working time; (vii) labour law and social insurance legislation \u2014 questions arising; (viii) the organization of work in cooper ative enterprises; (ix) changing patterns of time use. The above topics were the subject of working papers which were discussed at a seminar in Brussels in April 1986. In order to comprehend the wider political and social significance of the problems at hand, the seminar was preceded by a number of brief statements outlining the position of the European Commission, the Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, employers and employees, by the former member of the Commis sion Ralph Dahrendorf, who chaired the meeting. Jean Degimbe, Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Edu cation and Chairman of the Administra tive Board of the European Foundation, emphasized the great interest ex pressed by the Commission in the questions raised. A joint effort on the part of all concerned was needed to find workable solutions to the apparent con flict between economic reality and peo ple's needs, desires and expectations. It was the desire to see this conflict re solved that resulted in the endeavours, reflected in the moves to revive and in tensify the 'social dialogue' between un ions and employers, to heighten aware ness of the fact that only by joint action could the labour market evolve to meet changing requirements. This lent even greater importance to the task of acquir ing valid knowledge and insight, a pro cess in which the European Foundation could play a significant role. Michael Welsh, the Chairman of the European Parliament's Social Affairs and Employment Committee, pointed to the common ground that existed be tween the Foundation and his Com- 1 by Eberhard K\u00f6hler, Research Manager, Euro pean Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Dublin, Ireland. 77 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE mittee, given the fact that the themes of their work were closely related. He went on to say that while we in the EC coun tries had reached an unprecedented level of material and social prosperity, large sections of Europe's population found that their direct access to this ma terial well-being was impeded. In Welsh's opinion the phenomenon of un employment was not a temporary irritant affecting our social and economic sys tems but a structural problem that could only be tackled and overcome by far- reaching changes in people's attitudes and expectations. The logical step for ward was to cease classifying and defin ing various kinds of jobs and forms of employment according to a hierarchical system, but to see them In absolute terms, as a continuum, thus tackling at the root the problem of social discrimi nation against 'atypical' forms of em ployment. Steps had to be taken to pre vent the formation of a new class sys tem, and in particular to avoid the danger posed by the creation of a new 'lower class' which would consist of people with little or inadequate edu cation and training and who, in a more competitive labour market, would find themselves left standing by the wayside, their prospects nil. Recognizing this danger and taking measures to counter act it, whether or not this meant calling for adaptation and change on all sides, was one of the most important political tasks of our time, for, Welsh declared, a society that is unable to integrate its weaker members into its framework is a society without a future. It was Welsh's hope that the close cooperation estab lished between the European Foun dation and the Committee of which he was chairman would provide the im pulse towards finding a political solution to the problem posed by the need to re vive and reorientate the labour market. This collaboration was intensive and mutually beneficial outside the confines of the seminaras well. Speaking on behalf of the European Community's Economic and Social Committee, Enrico Kirschen underlined the interdependence and interrelation of social and economic trends. The gen eral level of social security achieved throughout the Community should not be casually put at risk. If technological innovations in production led to costly investment which in turn resulted for reasons of cost and business efficiency in a reorganization of work and working hours to exploit new capacity, the out come should not be a deterioration in working conditions for those who made greater productiveness possible. This meant that there should be no discrimi nation against part-time work or periodic working. It also meant that matters such as health and safety at work might have to be reconsidered. In other words the social aspects of the revolution now tak ing olace in electronics and technology should not take a back seat to the macroeconomic aspects of worldwide competition. This perspective had been reflected in important work undertaken by the Economic and Social Committee such as the report 'Europe and the new technologies: research, industry, social', which was published in June 1986. Within this scenario as a whole the Eu ropean Foundation had an important part to play by helping to elucidate the social consequences of technological developments. The Foundation believed that its research programme was broad enough to meet the challenge posed by the task of finding solutions, and that a contribution could be made towards en suring that technological change evolved along lines that were accept able to society as a whole. Finally, Ralf Dahrendorf, who was present in his capacity as Chairman of the seminar and as head of a high-level group of experts convened by the OECD, drew a line between global prob lems and possible European Com munity solutions, which merited wider- ranging discussion. The constantly high level of unemployment made it neces sary to consider the future of work in the widest possible context. The structural problems of the labour market had to be regarded as supplementary to global macroeconomics. According to Dahren dorf, who based his views on his work with the above-mentioned OECD group of experts, and its May 1986 report en titled 'Labour market flexibility', the question of labour market reorganization and reorientation was caught between four interconnected problem areas; each of which can be defined separately (quoted from the above report, p. 6): (1 ) The need for economic adjustment. The 'shocks' of the 1970s (energy, inflation, interest rates, and chang ing patterns of international trade) have underlined the importance of greater responsiveness in labour markets, as well as product and factor markets, to minimize the ef fects of such shocks on economic growth and to promote a more competitive and efficient environ ment. (2) The need for technological innova tion. New inventions and new forms of human organization ('infor mation society') have combined to open up economic and social op portunities. (3) The need to deal with new social problems. Persistent unemploy ment has become the dominant social issue in many OECD coun tries; it is often accompanied by other social problems (inner-city squalor, crime) which require re sponses. (4) The need to enhance the quality of life. Changing expectations and aspirations of people as em ployees, but also in their lives be yond the world of employment, create demands for action. In Dahrendorf's opinion there is no panacea for these problems, neither if treated individually, nor if treated as a complex whole. It should nevertheless be possible to outlire certain strategies for change which might lead to a solu tion, without these being considered the cure-all that so many people seem to long for. This meant recognizing and ac knowledging that it may not be desir able to search for an all-round effective remedy, that indeed, the attraction may lie in a variety of possible and different solutions. Differences did not necessarily need to be overcome but could indeed be preserved. We ought not to look for an American solution or a Japanese solu- 78 ",

In other words, a Euro pean solution which would preserve, even strengthen competitiveness in world markets without breaking the his torical, cultural, economic, political and institutional framework by which Europe Is defined. Admittedly, finding the right balance will be difficult, even painful, but the search should not be regarded as impossible. The Foundation intends, by creating and preparing scientifically reliable infor mation, to play its part in enabling de cision-makers at every level to recog nize what, in the search for balanced so lutions, is socially and economically de sirable, worthy and feasible, and in intro ducing, overseeing and implementing the changes required both on a Europe- wide scale and in the individual member countries without serious social disrup tion. The first phase of the task lay in de fining and measuring the problem. The position papers which were commis sioned for this purpose by the Foun dation and which are reproduced in a European Foundation publication of September 1986,' are intended to give the initial 'feel' of the problem and its manifold nature. The position is influ enced by the views put forward by the two sides of industry. The question of defining the concrete scope of the ac tual field research to be undertaken by the European Foundation is at the mo ment the focus of intensive discussion by two consultative committees, one 'technical' and one 'political'.

        "Cooperation between trade unions and universities A German experience A better mutual flow of infor mation and greater cooperation be tween universities and the business world is an objective that is now being pursued in all the advanced industrial States. The efforts that are being taken to achieve this ob jective include mostly companies, trade associations and chambers of commerce; however, they are also or could be open to the workers' representations. It was against this background that in 1985 the German Federal Government decided to support a project to Improve cooperation be tween universities and trade unions as an initial phase and for a limited period of time. 1 The project which was carried out by the Social Policy Department of the Federal Executive Board of the German Trade Unions Feder ation (Deutscher Gewerkschafts bund \u2014 DGB) from 1 September 1982 to 31 August 1985, was en titled 'Regional opening of univers ity research to workers' problems by establishing cooperation offices \u2014 an examination of the possibili ties for continuous cooperation be tween universities and trade unions'. It was mainly financed with funds from the Federal Ministry of Education and Science and the DGB. The total volume of finance was DM 3.16 million for the first three years. Objectives of the project The objectives of the project were to research the organizational conditions and the contents needed to open uni versity research to workers' problems on a regional basis, and to try out forms of continuous cooperation between trade unions, workers and universities in research, teaching and further training, in crder to open the universities more to the problems of workers and so to part of their regional environment. Five regional projects \u2014 their organization For that purpose five university/trade union cooperation offices were set up in the university areas of Dortmund, Ham burg, Kassel, Oldenburg and T\u00fcbingen. When choosing the cooperation regions the aim was to have as wide a range as possible of university and trade union conditions. The following were the main criteria: the structure of the universities and the range of subjects represented, the union infrastructure and attempts at cooperation hitherto. The cooperation offices were to pro mote the development of continuous cooperation between the workers and their unions and the universities in the region. Each cooperation office had two lo cal project leaders, one from the union side and one from the university. The work, of the cooperation office in the re gion was followed by a regional advi sory council, half of whose members were representatives of the university and the other half union representatives from the region. A national coordination office was also set up at the DGB Fed eral Executive Board to coordinate the work of the offices and support the cen tral direction of the project. The provision of funds was the same for all the cooperation offices in the three-year period. It amounted to around DM 185 000 a year, with a further DM 152 000 in staff funds. The organization has proved its worth As mentioned, the main focus of the project was the working out of organiza tional forms of research transfer for workers. A decisive factor in its success proved to be the integration of the coop eration offices in tne existing regional trade union structures. This together with the offices' close ties to the national unions were their greatest structural ad vantage. They found out what the need for cooperation was, initiated and fol lowed cooperative projects and helped to implement the results. With their ties to the workers and their organizations they were in a position to establish the need for research and articulate this to the universities. However, the work of the cooper ation offices was much supported by the regional councils in which union representatives from the region and re presentatives of the universities to gether laid down focal areas for cooper ation; this played a very positive role in shaping and building up channels of cooperation. The communication pro cesses in the regional councils brought research and the world of work closer together. Thus the participation of the researchers in the regional councils made the workers aware of the difficult ies of producing research results, while on the other side the participation of the trade unions in the region, and the pos sibility this offered for them to give an account of their main areas of work gave the researchers a greater understanding of the difficulties and problems facing the workers in the region. The work of the cooperation office closely followed by the regional coun cils enabled cooperation between the various individual unions to open uni versity research in the area. Up to then ' The project followed on from the results of the research project carried out from 1977 to 1980 in the University of Bielefeld and financed by the Federal Ministry of Education and Science, 'Workers' living and working conditions as a subject for university research'. 80 ",
        "COOPERATION BETWEEN TRADE UNIONS AND UNIVERSITIES the workers and their unions in the re gion very often were not acquainted with either the research facilities or individual academics who might be interested in cooperation, nor did cooperation with universities play any part in local and re gional union work. Since care was taken in appointing members to the regional councils to en sure that the whole range of university subjects in that region was represented, membership of the regional council pro vided the first contacts for academic dis ciplines that had so far played little part in channels of communication. Altogether it can be said that the or ganizational form used so far in the pro ject has proved its worth. It has also proved flexible enough to cope with the differing degrees of maturity of the cooperation channels. Whereas in T\u00fcbingen, for instance, the cooperation office still had to perform a considerable amount of initial work in building up channels of cooperation, the Oldenburg office could draw on a traditional coop eration structure. But in both cases the basic principle and organizational form of the cooperation office with regional project leaders and a regional council proved effective. Although the starting conditions dif fered, all the cooperation offices suc ceeded in building up and widening channels of cooperation. With the exist ing differences in the state of cooper ation there were disequilibria in the starting conditions at first, but as the work went on, channels of cooperation developed in university areas which had previously had no experience of this at all. In addition to trying out and re searching the organizational conditions necessary for lasting channels of coop eration, great emphasis was laid on red ucing structural obstacles to access for workers to regional university research and the promotion of applied research which would take into account the prob lems of workers. Impact on research The impact of the cooperation of fices on university research can to date only be described as minor, since the length of the project was too short to al low larger cooperative research projects to be carried out. However, so far it can be said that the need for cooperation expressed by the workers through the channels of communication to university research facilities, some of which is al ready emerging in research orojects, has raised new questions in the re search institutions involved. So the cooperation has helped to make uni versity research more oriented towards the problems of workers in the region. It was also evident that the channels of cooperation changed the degree to which the research workers involved penetrated problems and opened up new perspectives for the university re searchers. More than anything, the cooperation offers the opportunity, to a degree of in tensity not otherwise easily matched, to gain an insight into social processes by involvement in the real social con troversy and to check and correct this insight in dialogue with those directly in volved. This can then be followed by a process of mutual analysis. Of course, such proximity to social reality is not possible, or methodologi cally appropriate, in every case of scien tific analysis. However, it is not limited to specific subject areas. The project proved it possible to in clude workers' problems in some scien tific disciplines that had so far had no experience of cooperation through the channels opened up. Such activities can very greatly widen the circle of university staff and the number of university disci plines participating in cooperation. Student counselling A further consequence of the project was the greater recourse to the co operation offices for student counsel ling. Students who were looking for a suitable subject for a diploma or doc toral thesis in the field of labour studies in the regions where cooperation offices have been set up now frequently contact the offices for this purpose. Students also need contacts with trade unions and workers for the purposes of their work. A further group who came to the cooperation offices with requests for ad vice were teachers and pupils who needed help in developing teaching modules. Increasing interest in cooperation Altogether It can be said that in the five regions involved, with their very dif ferent conditions, interest in this kind of cooperation has grown: (i) workers have learnt to make their own demands on research workers and put new questions to them; (ii) trade unions have received answers from research workers to a wide range of problems; (iii) research workers have learnt to come to grips with new questions; (iv) there has been a joint search for new forms of cooperation, not only in defining problems but also in publishing and handling the results of research; (v) new social dimensions have been opened up for research that are re lated to practical experience and in inter-disciplinary cooperation; (vi) a great deal of mediation and trans lation work has been undertaken to make the cooperation between the universities and the trade unions profitable and beneficial for both sides. Much still has to be learned The project also encountered a num ber of difficulties, such as: (i) workers have difficulty in formulating their research and transfer require ments, so that it is scarcely possible to work on these; in some cases they do not even know that it is pos sible to carry out research on these issues; 81 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE (ii) research results that are available and that affect workers' problems need to be put into practice so as really to reach those concerned; (iii) research workers often have little di rect contact with workers' practical problems and so they can receive no stimulus from these for their work; (iv) workers often have little experience of contact with research facilities, and so are unfamiliar with the time horizons, working methods and possibilities of research; (v) the organizational structure of the trade unions according to industries and sectors requires greater coordi nation between the unions to group workers' problems together and en able them to be presented to the re search facilities as a common prob lem; (vi) so far neither workers, trade unions, research workers nor universities have much experience of translating the everyday problems of workers into questions that can be handled in research. Continuation of the project Initially the German project was planned for three years only; however, in the course of the work it became evi dent that a longer-term institutionaliz ation of the cooperation offices was essential and it is evident that an institu tional framework with a minimum provi sion of staffing and equipment is a pre requisite for a cooperation process. As a first step the promoters of the German project have therefore agreed to finance a continuation of the project up to 31 August 1987. Considerable amounts of public money are spent on the transfer of knowledge, research, etc. from the uni versities to the economy, much of which goes to company counselling. The Ger man project demonstrates that much still remains to be done in the interests of the workers ard their trade unions and the union representatives in the plant in cooperation with the universities and other research establishments. So far there have been only a few practical cases of workers and their rep resentatives participating in an institu tionalized research process and the type of cooperation, as applied in the German case, is only an example of how cooperation between unions and universities or other research institu tions can be carried out. EEC conference In order to carry the matter a stage further the European Commission is or ganizing a conference on 15 and 16 June 1987. At this conference a number of cases, such as the German one, will be presented and experiences dis cussed. Lars Erik Andreasen 82 ",
        "Cedefop conference on the vocational education and training, and employment prospects, of young people in the European Community 22 and 23 September 1986 The aim of this conference was twofold: to present a balance-sheet of current Community action, parti cularly concerning the education and training of young people and to raise, with participants, the issues and challenges for future action. On current issues, reports were given by the Commission on the second Community programme on the transition from school to work ing life, on the implementation of the 1983 Resolution on vocational training for the 1980s, and the 'six- month training guarantee' for young people in particular. The role of the European Social Fund and Cedefop projects on 'Social and vocational integration' and on 'new forms of training and employment' and 'vo cational training and job creation programmes' were outlined. Despite continuing high youth un employment, the mid-1980s were see ing a change of emphasis. As the emergency programmes to deal with large numbers of jobless young people became a permanent feature of training provision, the central theme of political debate was shifting to training the adult workforce and to the problems of the long-term unemployed. The European Community, however, numbered more than 53 million young people (14\u201425) many of whom contin ued to face longer and longer periods of transition into the labour market, includ ing ever longer periods of unemploy ment. The European Council, meeting in Milan in June 1985, recognizing the need for a continuing commitment to young people, adopted the Adonnino Report asking 'Member States to do their utmost, within national policies, wherever possible in association with enterprises and social partners, to en sure that all young people wishing to do so receive one year's or if possible two years' vocational training in addition to their complusory education'. The Commission was asked to implement this commitment in concrete form and to this end discussions had al ready taken place in the Advisory Com mittee for Vocational Training, whose opinion was discussed in working groups during the conference. The conference also addressed some specific questions, fundamental to any consideration of action to be taken by the Member States and by the Com mission to implement the Milan commit ment. The conference, taking as a starting point the commitment already made by the Heads of State or Government, con sidered that a number of important issues of principle needed to be ad dressed by the Commission in carrying out its mandate: (i) It was generally accepted that an ex tended period of up to two years access to training following compul sory education was of value to young people, provided that quality was guaranteed and that this was not simply a means of keeping young people off the labour market. (ii) In providing vocational education and training in general terms for all 16\u201418 year olds, the systems needed to be flexible enough to cope with all the needs of young people, while being sufficiently coordinated to appear coherent to the young people entering and mov ing through the system. (iii) Experience to date of previous tem porary programmes showed the need to set higher standards and ensure the provision of recognized qualifications. (iv) More account needed to be taken of the views of young people them selves, particularly with regard to their social and material status as they move towards full indepen dence. (v) Attention needed to be paid to ren dering guidance and counselling more effective to ensure that young people most in need of guidance re ceived it and received it in a motiv ating form. (vi) More concern was being ex pressed, particularly by employers, that large numbers of young people leave school lacking the basic skills, (literacy, numeracy and communica tion skills). This was a problem that needed to be tackled within the school systems, while recognizing that for many young people already leaving school specific provision needed to be made. (vii) The role of social partners and em ployers needed to be more active particularly in so far as young people still within the compulsory education system was concerned. The conference, in general, en dorsed the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Vocational Training as the outline of a way forward for the 83 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE Member States and the Community as a whole. The importance of concrete ac tion in this area was underlined and great interest expressed in particular in the stimulation of partnerships between all the bodies and organizations in volved with young people. Closer coor dination was an objective, particularly of education and training authorities to gether with employers, in many Member States, and additional impetus from the Commission would serve to emphasize the importance of this coordination. The organization of an exchange of experi ences in this context and across the range of issues discussed at the confer ence was considered vital, particularly for Member States where the training process was under examination or in a stage of development. The Commission was asked to take account of the views expressed during the conference in the implementation of the Community's pol icy commitment to young people. Copyright REA/P. Nieto 84 ",
        "Education in the European Community Charting the differences The education systems in the Member States of the European Community vary widely: from the locally organized and delivered, to the centrally structured and con trolled. This variety reflects the cul tural diversity and richness of Eu rope: it is a richness which cannot be harmonized out of existence, but must be preserved for the future.' Fine words \u2014 and received wisdom, indeed. No one in the Community's in stitutions wants to see the education systems reduced to a low-grade com mon denominator, which is all that a compromise between our various Mem ber States would come to. After all, not only with 12 Member States, but also with 11 different and independent sys tems in the Federal Republic of Ger many alone, and three in the United Kingdom, and with Spain with its proc ess of devolution in this field under way, it becomes difficult to compute the num ber of educational systems within the European Community at all. On the other hand, the Community is interested in sharing the experience of this diversity \u2014 in building channels for the passage of information between neighbouring Member States, whose historical links may not have been with their current partners in the Community. This is one of the foundations of Com munity activity, foreseen as such in the education action programme in Febru ary 1976, as well as being a primary reason for the existence of the Com munity's network of information centres \u2014 the Eurydice network on education policy, the European network of centres for information on the academic recog nition of degrees and diplomas ac quired abroad, the Euryclee network on the new information technologies in the schools systems, to give but three examples. But merely recognizing the differ ences is not enough. Two studies launched by the Commission and re cently come to fruition chart particular ways in which aspects of the system vary \u2014 the first deals with the condi tions of service and career development of teachers, and the second with their in-service training. There is little more sensitive in edu cation than the questions of who can be counted as a teacher, and how much do they get paid. Are all teachers university graduates? If not, should they be? Should they earn more than the average industrial wage, and how much more? And how does their perceived income level affect their status in the eyes of the public? The study on the conditions of service and career development of teachers, which is funded jointly by the Commission and the Netherlands Minis try of Education and Science, and car ried out by the Leiden-based 'Stichting Research voor Beleid' (the Dutch Gov ernment's administrative research foun dation) consists of 11 'national mono graphs\" (Scotland, for this purpose, counting as a separate part of the United Kingdom), and one comparative and analytical report at European level. Much of the basic work on the na tional monographs has been carried out by and through the national Eurydice units; it is they who have provided the mass of factual information that has had to be gathered, and it is through them that national agreement has been deliv ered to the final text of each monograph. But the analytical and comparative study is purely the work of the research insti tute, and as such provides interesting and neutral food for thought on the dif ferent ways in which teachers are treated and regarded in the different Member States. The national monographs cover: the structure of education in the country; teaching appointments; salaries; nature of duties expected of the teacher; other conditions of employment (e.g. pen sions or health insurance), and career development prospects. The study pro vides a mass of detailed, and verified, factual material and represents the first comparative study in this detail in Eu rope. But if this study is purely factual, the study carried out through the Labora toire de P\u00e9dagogie Exp\u00e9rimentale of the University of Li\u00e8ge by one UK and one French expert, on the in-service training of teachers, is different in nature. True, it demonstrates with admirable clarity through seven coloured diagrams just how the in-service training of teachers functions in the Member States, and in what context. But it seeks above all to set this within a policy context; to see what answers have been given in the various Member States to the two great questions: 85 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE (i) The critical mass: how can in-ser vice training provision be developed and diversified so as to reach a number of teachers sufficient to make the activity worthwhile in terms of its impact on the education system as a whole? (ii) Changes in attitude: how can the re sources, content and types of in- service training be organized and delivered so as to bring about a real change in the professional practice of the individual teacher? Given the 'diversity', the 'richness' of our educational systems, there can be no simple or generalizable response. But the report sets out the major prob lems and suggests what may be the main conditions for effectiveness of pro vision. It is in this respect that it pro vides food for continuing thought and discussion at Community level, and may lead, in due course, to some further col laborative efforts.

        "The drive against illiteracy in the Member States In line with the conclusions adopted by the Ministers for Educa tion on 4 June 1984 on methods of combating illiteracy in the Commu nity, the Commission has asked 'Lire et Ecrire' ('Read and Write' \u2014 a literacy campaign body) to con duct a study on 'the pathways of il literacy'. The agency acts as an umbrella organization for the bodies involved in a wide-ranging literacy campaign, coordinating the work of the var ious agencies throughout French- speaking Belgium offering commu nity-based assistance to help adults and young people improve their literacy skills. The purpose of the research was to explain the process by which adults who have completed their basic formal education can emerge from the school system without having learned to read or write. The authors of the study con ducted a survey among people with impaired or no literacy skills under going literacy tuition at the time of the survey. 'Lire et Ecrire' also gathered comparative data from lit eracy resource agencies in a variety of countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United King dom). The survey is split into two sections: the quantitative aspect, and a qualitative analysis based on structured group recall interviews. From an analysis of the data gath ered, the researchers advance proposals for the prevention of illit eracy at school, using both educa tional and social tools. These pro posals form the third section of the research report. Copyright REA/D. Maillac Conclusions of the study In their analysis of the data pro duced by the structured group recall in terviews, the authors sought to bring to the fore the mechanics of illiteracy as they spring from the conflict between the sociocultural heritage of the child and the very different sociocultural logic of the school. Starting from the visible face of illiter acy \u2014 opting out of school \u2014 the au thors move on to an analysis of the 87 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE ways in which the school system stig matizes children with learning difficulties (being sent to the back of the class, public humiliation, punishment...) and which seeks to legitimize that discrimi nation by throwing the blame on the child. The same type of discrimination re curs in the child's peer relationships, superimposed by class discrimination against children whose outward appear ance and attitudes do not reflect the 'of ficial' social norms. The authors have also sought to an alyse the values and behavioural pat terns transmitted to the child by its par ents; for instance, the leisure of the child, like that of its parents, is centred on communal recreational activities, where form (togetherness) is more im portant than content (which tends to be non-cerebral). Their analysis leads the authors to formulate the following hypothesis. The values and rules of the school (competi tion between individuals, the suppres sion of freedom of movement and ex pression, the primacy of intellectual ac tivities over physical ones) are in open conflict with the values and behaviour learned at home (importance of manual labour, little intellectual activity, commu nal leisure). Children from working class backgrounds are thus confronted with two sets of values. Their successful inte gration into the school system will there fore be decisive for (or decided by) which of those two cultural systems they finally accept (or the degree to which they succeed in reconciling the two). A child who rejects the school cul ture will manifest his rejection in ways of avoiding writing (cheating, indifference, creating disturbances,...) and by seek ing other outlets for the assertion of self- esteem (manual activities, fighting,...). He thus develops a learning block \u2014 what the authors describe as creat ing 'an illiterate self: to resolve the con flict between the individual's view of his ideal self and the way in which society regards impaired literacy, those with lit eracy problems withdraw into them selves, identifying only with those sim ilarly afflicted, or externalize their conflict in aggressive behaviour, which re inforces and legitimizes the discriminat ory attitude of the school. Pointers towards the prevention of illiteracy at school Particular attention should be de voted to children with learning difficul ties \u2014 what the authors describe as 'positive discrimination'. This pivots on the attitude of the classroom teacher, on the need to pay special attention to those in the greatest difficulty, those in danger of 'opting-out'. Assessment could be a valuable tool for this: not used to brand children as under achieves, or to drive them into 'low at tainment' social roles, but as a continu ous diagnostic tool for determining the child's progress not in terms of the volume of work produced but rather of basic skills acquired. With the method and attitude to wards the child decided, the next task is to define the content. And faced with the wide cultural divide between the home and school environments, the content of literacy tuition must more firmly comple ment what the child learns at home, it must build on his own life experiences to create learning structures which both open up to him, and allow him to domi nate, his immediate environment and the reality which is his own world within the network of relationships by which it is criss-crossed. In this respect, nursery provision has a role to play not only in preparing chil dren for reading (familiarizing them and bringing in the connection with writing), but also in the realm of self-discovery, realizing their own potentials and learn ing about the world around them. In view of the importance of the par ental role in successful education, and the lack of social confidence of working class parents in the school context, the authors have sought to map out tracks or pointers for a community education project in which parents would be com mitted partners in the education of their children. Such a project can only suc ceed by 'de-schooling' parent/school relations to the maximum, by opening the school up to the family and personal experiences of the child, by making the school more accessible to parents (an outreach approach), by a project for training parents in an expanded edu cational framework and by involving parents in school life. The authors conclude with a few re marks specific to two groups of student: migrant workers' children and the chil dren of gypsies and itinerants for whom schools must apply themselves to the task of providing structures and content relevant to the realities of the children's everyday lives.

        "International symposium Workplace air monitoring Diffusive sampling \u2014 an alternative approach Luxembourg, 22\u201426 September 1986 This symposium was organized by the Commission of the European Communities in cooperation with the World Health Organization, the Health and Safety Executive and Royal Society of Chemistry of the United Kingdom. The 1978 action programme of the European Communities on health and safety at work stresses the need of a common method ology for monitoring both pollutant concentrations and measurement of environmental conditions at places of work; to carry out inter- comparison programmes and to es tablish reference methods for the determination of the most impor tant pollutants. A diffusive sampler is a device which is capable of taking samples of gas or vapour pollutants from the atmosphere at a rate controlled by a physical process such as diffu sion through a static air layer or permeation through a membrane, but which does not involve the ac tive movement of the air through the sampler. The objectives of this symposium were: (i) to review the state of the art of diffu sive sampler techniques; (ii) to stimulate the exchange of tech nical information; (iii) to assess the suitability and range of applications for workplace moni toring; (iv) to promote the further development of this technique and its wider use. The following main topics were covered: (i) philosophy of diffusive sampling; (ii) current field applications; (iii) role of diffusive sampling in work place air monitoring; (iv) current trends in the development of diffusive sampling and analyses systems. The symposium was attended by more than 200 participants (industrial hygienists, occupational physicians, an alysts, researchers, employer and trade union representatives, and off cials from regulatory agencies) from all Member States of the European Communities and a number of other countries such as Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Nor way, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America. On the basis of 23 invited papers and oral presentations, 55 poster pres entations, extensive discussions and a panel on the acceptability of diffusive sampling as a monitoring technique, the symposium reached the following con clusions and recommendations. Conclusions and recommen dations 1. In recent years there has been: (i) a very significant increase in use of diffusive samplers in var ious circumstances (wide range of applications, including ep idemiological studies); (ii) a continuous evolution of new designs; (iii) an increasing interest among manufacturers for the produc tion of diffusive samplers. 2. The theoretical basis for diffusive sampling has been confirmed by laboratory and field trials. 3. Active and diffusive sampling are complementary approaches each one having areas of applicability which may overlap. Each have their roles in a strategy for monitoring workers' exposure. 4. The suitability of diffusive samplers for short sampling times and/or con centrations should be further investi gated. 5. The follow-up analysis of diffusive samples does not appear to present specific problems. 6. Cost-benefit analysis with respect to other monitoring systems is a com plex procedure due to the many par ameters involved. In routine operations when compar ing with active systems diffusive sampling presents usually: (i) higher costs in terms of the sampler; (ii) no costs in relation to pump and maintenance; (iii) less manpower requirements for system handling. 7. In general there seems to be no significant difference between the accuracy and precision of diffusive sampling and other monitoring sys tems such as active pumped sam pling. 8. Validation of all sampling systems is essential both in the laboratory and in the field. For diffusive sampling, on the basis of theory and experience, the follow ing main parameters must be in cluded in a validation procedure: humidity, face velocity, ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE temperature, concentration, exposure time, storage, shelf-life, interferences, orientation. The currently used protocols have many features in common, which should facilitate the elaboration of a unique, simple validation protocol, adaptable to future needs. The exist ence of such a protocol will help us ers interpret performance data pro vided by manufacturers. Intercomparison programmes and the availability of certified standards should complement the validation studies. On the basis of validation protocols, acceptability criteria for the perform ance of diffusive samplers can be established by appropriate authori ties as a function of the applications (such as compliance with limit values). 9. Quality assurance in the production and preparation of diffusive sam plers, and in particular for the sor- bent material is essential. Such quality assurance should be based on elements of the validation proto cols; the quality assurance proce dures and results should be avail able to users. 10. Manufacturers of diffusive samplers should provide users in addition to the validation and quality assurance date, information on applications and limitations of use. 11. To better identify the possible range of application (in terms of chemi cals) of the various types of diffusive samplers, it would be advisable to establish a widely agreed list of chemicals, (including suitable sor- bent materials), monitor types, prac tical uptake rates and diffusion co efficients. The establishment of such a list should assist with the prediction for other suitable systems and/or chemicals. 12. The use of diffusive samplers may introduce flexibility in the monitoring strategy. 13. An increasing range of direct read ing (colour) diffusive samplers is be coming available; they are likely to play an increasing role in the future as no laboratory analysis is re quired. The development of such monitors for both organic and inor ganic substances should be en couraged. 14. Diffusive samplers do not interfere with worker activity and are unlikely to affect the behaviour pattern of the wearer. In this connection, at no ex tra inconvenience to the workers, two or more diffusive samplers with different applicabilities are often used simultaneously. The use of these samplers, and es pecially direct reading monitors, can help to lead to safer work patterns. 15. It was agreed that as a general principle, any method is'acceptable by regulatory authorities and hy gienists if used by experts within its defined limitations; this applies equally to diffusive samplers. 90 ",

        "Overall developments Greece: Applying the 1986-87 programme In pursuit of its 1986-87 programme for improving the balance of payments situation and the rate of inflation, the government is now orientating its action towards new measures specifically for creating new jobs and improving the competitiveness of enterprises. Unemployment is not only a quanti tative problem of those currently seek ing work. Various studies show that the Greek labour force is increasing annu ally by some 30 000 new job-seekers, these being both school-leavers/gradu ates and returning migrants. These studies also indicate that to eradicate unemployment by 1990, 90 000 new jobs are needed in addition to those for the currently unemployed. The increase in unemployment, as shown by statistics, mainly affects women and young persons under 25 years of age. In the light of this situation the gov ernment is taking measures to enhance the solidarity of the labour market. The concept of increased labour market flex ibility is being examined by employment officials. The following measures are going to be implemented following the necessary legislative arrangements: (i) Pre-retirement status: Employees over 60 years of age or those over 55 who have not completed the req uisite years of employment to qual ify for retirement, can make an agreement with their employer to remain part-time in their job. These part-time jobs are of at least four hours a day and paid accordingly; they last until all the conditions needed for retirement are fulfilled. Both employers and employees pay social security contributions ac cording to the time actually worked, with the National Manpower Agency, OAED, making up the dif ference with full-time contributions. Employees who thus have full social security coverage are nat urally not allowed to take on a se cond job. The employer should hire a per son in receipt of benefit to fill the re mainder of the full-time job. The government will appraise the results of the measure after six months and thereafter decide on its continuation. (ii) Employing pensioners: Pensioners are not allowed to work in the pub lic sector except in cases of special consultants. Nor is their employ ment allowed in the private sector if their pension exceeds a certain threshold. Exceptions are foreseen in some cases of their being hired as advisers. (\u00a1ii) Implementing shift-work: Following agreement at the enterprise level, a fourth shift can be introduced for taking on new employees. (iv) Overtime: Working overtime will not be allowed in the public sector. In the private sector the upper limits of overtime are unchanged, but it will start after 45 hours of work per week, rather than 48 hours as to day. (v) Implementing local initiative pro grammes: The creation of a special committee for local initiatives is foreseen for each region. This will cover technical, financial infor mation etc. assistance to small lo cal enterprises, municipal firms, producer cooperatives and all other efforts covering local needs. ( vi ) Enhancing worker mobility. (vii) Improving vocational training. (viii) Self-employment initiatives: A Presidential order has been pu blished enabling OAED to finance those in receipt of unemployment benefit to set up in business on their own. France: Abolition of administrative authorization prior to dismissals (Law of 3 July 1986) This law dealing with the abolition of the need for prior authorization when declaring redundancies comprises two sets of measures. The first come into force immediately whereas the others become effective from 1 January 1987. After having briefly gone over the situation as it was until the new law came into force, this article reviews suc cessively those measures which are of immediate effect and those which come into force later. I. The previous situation Ever since the law of 3 January 1975 any individual or collective redundancy for economic reasons, whether cyclical or structural, required the authorization of the competent public authorities. Only companies which were being wound up or whose affairs were under court ad ministration were exempt from this rule; in these cases the public authorities were only consulted. The law furthermore distinguished two cases: (i) where enterprises were considering the dismissal of at least 10 employ ees within a single period of 30 days; (ii) where enterprises were considering the dismissal of less than 10 em ployees within a single period of 30 days. In both cases the public authorities were required to monitor the validity of the grounds for redundancy. But in the first case they had furthermore to check the adherence to the procedure for con sulting employee representatives as well as the scope of the redeployment measures ('social plan'). In the second case monitoring dealt solely with the validity of the grounds for redundancy. Furthermore, any employer who, dur ing the 12 months following a dismissal for economic reasons, wanted to recruit personnel, had to request authorization from the competent authorities. II. Measures taking immediate effect These measures, three in number, concern: 94 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES (i) the abolition of the procedure to ob tain prior authorization for recruit ment in the 12 months following re dundancy; (ii) the abolition, in all cases, of the public authorities monitoring the validity of the grounds for redun dancy; (iii) the abolition of consultation with public authorities over redundan cies declared in the context of a recovery procedure or a winding-up procedure by court order. (1) The first immediate measure con cerns the abolition of the require ment to obtain prior authorization for recruitment and dismissals in the 12 months following redun dancy, a requirement which stemmed from the 24 May 1945 Order on controlling employment. Thus there is no longer any em ployment control except the sole requirement for establishments and professions specified in an inter departmental decree to inform pub lic manpower services of any hiring or termination of an employment contract. The current monthly state ment of manpower flows which con cerns establishments with more than 50 employees is thus main tained. In its new version, the law neverthe less keeps open the possibility of recruitment monitoring but on a ne gotiated basis between government and companies when the latter re duce their manpower while drawing on special early retirement allow ances from the National Employ ment Fund. (2) The requirement to monitor the val idity of the grounds for redundancy and, in consequence, to obtain prior authorization for redundancies affecting less than 10 employees in a single period of 30 days has also been abo'ished. 2.1. Abolishing the monitoring of the validity of the grounds for redun dancy has two aspects. For redun dancies affecting at least 10 em ployees within a single period of 30 days, prior authorization will still be required until 31 December 1986 but will only involve the adherence to the rules of consulting employee representatives and the scope of the social plan drawn up by the em ployer. For redundancies affecting less than 10 employees in a single period of 30 days, the procedure which involved only monitoring the validity of the grounds for redun dancy has been abolished since publication of the law. In other words, until 1 January 1987 when the authorization procedure will completely disappear, the only enterprises or establishments which are subject to public authori ties' authorization are those falling under Article L.321.3 of the Labour Code: those which usually employ more than 10 employees and when the number of redundancies en visaged is at least equal to 10 dur ing a single period of 30 days. 2.2. In cases where the authorization procedure disappears, i.e. dismis sals of less than 10 employees, the law seeks to ensure that the em ployees concerned receive all the requisite information of the grounds for the redundancy and give Ihem an opportunity of making known their views on this subject. It does this, as in the case of individual dis missals, by requiring there to be a previous interview with the em ployer for employees with at least one year's seniority. This requirement is being pro visionally extended until 31 Decem ber 1986 to cover redundancies in all enterprises or establishements, including those with less than 11 employees. (3) The third measure with Immediate effect concerns the abolition of the consultation with public authorities over redunancies declared in the context of a turn-around or a wind ing-up procedure by court order. Under the new law, in cases of turn arounds or winding-up procedures by court order the administrator or, failing him, the employer or the liquidator, depending on the case, must inform the competent public authorities prior to declaring redun dancies. III. Measures to be carried out later (1 ) The entire procedure to obtain prior authorization for redundancies will be abolished from 1 January 1987. Before then, the government will put a Bill before the first 1986-87 ordi nary session of parliament. Taking into account the results of collective bargaining on this subject between the social partners, the Bill will set out the procedures aimed at ensur ing the adherence to the rules con cerning the information and consul tation of the employee representa tives and the drafting of redeploy ment measures and compensation envisaged by the employer for re dundancies. This same Bill also has to define the changes to be made to labour law to respect the EEC Di rective 75/129 of 17 February 1975 on collective redundancies. (2) Article 6 of the law provides for the Ministry in charge of labour and employment to present to parlia ment on 30 June of each year, from 1987 onwards, a report on dismis sals and hirings which occurred in the course of the past year. This re port should include in particular ex act indications on the numbers, reasons, size of enterprises and in dustries to which they belong. France: 1986 budget of the national employment agency (ANPE) Deciding on ANPE's annual budget is a fundamental act which conditions its action and collective intentions as well as sets out its limits. ANPE's room for manoeuvre is not unlimited: it falls within the framework of general directives for preparing the budget of the State and 95 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE the internai constraints of on-going ac tivities. The draft budget is the outcome of collective thinking which takes account of multiple local and national data, the medium term orientations of the IX Plan as well as ANPE's own multi-annual plans. It seeks to closely espouse the objectives defined with the programme contracts. Moreover, it is the outcome of pro gressively bringing together the needs expressed by the network and pro gramme coordinators and the resources made available at the end of the arbitra tion process through State grants and ANPE's other resources. Representing 0.3% of the State's budget, the ANPE budget has exceeded from 1985 the figure of FF 3 billion (bn), amounting in 1986 to more than FF 3.3bn. Compared with the recent past (the 1980 budget amounted to FF 1bn) this is a considerable sum, the manage ment of which is, to a large extent, de centralized. It has to be rationally di vided up, managed with rigour and its utilization at all levels monitored. (i) Preparing the budget In conformity with the decisions taken in 1984 concerning financial reor ganization, ANPE's budget is now pre sented in the form of a programme bud get. Its preparation, implementation and monitoring are divided up between pro gramme coordinators at the national level, the centres having budgetary responsibility (these being those in charge of regional centres, of d\u00e9parte mental sections, of regional computer centres, of training centres and of some divisions and local offices), and DABCB, the directorate for administration, the budget and budgetary control. This recent approach, which is being continuously improved, aims to bring closely into line the operational objec tives and the management of budgetary and material resources. It renders man agers responsible at the same time as guaranteeing the overall financial equi librium of the agency. Drawing in 1985 on manual management information systems, the approach is being com pletely computerized from the first quar ter of 1986 through implementing the computerized application of SAGA-Pyr- amide. Hardware is currently being brought in to the central office, regional centres and departments. This is being accompanied by the completion of the decentralization of the budgetary pro cess and the implementation of the first elements of the policy of budgetary con trol. (ii) Overall orientations The programme contracts and the budget were prepared on the basis of the following orientations: (i) developing actions on behalf of job seekers, in particular those starting their fourth and thirteenth month of unemployment; (ii) strengthening actions towards en terprises with a view to improving matching job offers and developing services to enterprises, particularly related to alternance training meas ures; (iii) continuing the programme of com puterizing the agency both for op erational needs and internal man agement; (iv) improving the reception areas of employment offices and continuing the programme of refurbishing the premises. Each of these main areas of action was the subject of an analysis in terms of operational achievements and subse quently of a budgetary study taking into account the new resources made avail able to ANPE in 1986. (iii) The programmes The programme of services for job seekers is receiving additional finance amounting to FF 35m. This will cover the development of various programmes described in issues 9 and 12 of Infor- misep: SOA (in-depth guidance ses sion), TRE (job search techniques) and ENCP (appraisal of the level of voca tional competence), as well as taking over young people at the end of the scheme aimed at preparing their inser tion into working life. These resources also enable the activities of the agency concerned with industrial restructuring to be continued. The 'prestations-interventions' pro gramme consists both of activities which are included within the agency's budget (FF 208m in 1986) as well as ac tions financed by the State through the national employment fund (FNE) or through the (new) alternance training fund. On FNE financing, ANPE can draw on FF 287m in 1986 to continue running modular training periods for the long- term unemployed (a scheme which is really successful by exactly meeting the needs of the users). On the other hand, the 'up-grading' actions [actions de mise \u00e0 niveau) will be continued at the same rhythm as in the past, with a bud get of FF 50m. ANPE will play a central role in carrying out the scheme of train ing periods providing initiation into working life, the necessary resources having been written into the initial budget. The programme for developing ANPE's computerization is being given significant additional funds: FF 107.9m. This is being used in the area of compu terizing operations by running GIDE ('computerized management of jobs sought') in all units (the hardware having been acquired in the time allotted), and bringing the Nord-Pas-de-Calais plat form into operation. The 1986 budget also enables new projects and applica tions: GIDE 2, SAGE 2 [computerized job offers' management system), the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur regional platform, extension of CTIN [national computing centre) and vocational infor mation technology and the general public. For its internal management, ANPE will be able to provide its d\u00e9partemental services with micro-computers linked in to the major information systems: GIP (computerized personnel management); SAGA (system for helping administrative management); FAR (file for analysing the 96 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES network); and SAO (system for helping guidance). These micros will also be able to operate on their own, in line with the orientations of the information tech nology plan (plan bureautique). The sum available amounts to FF 12.7m. For the whole of its computerized programmes, ANPE is receiving an ad ditional endowment of FF 107.9m, which raises its 1986 operational budget for computerization to FF 236.3m. As re gards investments, the amount of au thorizations for programmes for pur chasing computer hardware and soft ware and for studies amounts to FF 49.5m. The modernization of offices and in stallations will be actively pursued in 1986 at the same rhythm as in 1983 and 1984. This is because the amounts made available for operations and in vestments will enable some 13 500 m 2 to be refurbished and brought into use. ANPE intends, over and above the strictly necessary refurbishings, to em phasize adapting the premises to new services, improving the public reception facilities and enhancing the quality of the facilities which contribute consider ably to ANPE's image. The training budget (FF 25.2m) en ables the action of past years to be maintained at a high level. These parti cularly concern recurrent training and ensuring the operating of the training centres. Finally, there is a need to stress that management will be further tightened during the year, drawing in particular on computerization. The development fore seen in the level of activities will thus be made possible despite a more difficult budgetary situation brought about by a 3% reduction in the State operating sub sidy. It should also be stressed that per sonnel remains the largest budgetary item, amounting in 1986 to FF 1,72bn. Italy: Agreement on decimals On 8 May 1986 Confindustria, the Confederation of employers, and the trade union confederations CGIL, CISL and UIL signed an agreement on the cost-of-living 'decimals', sanctioning the social partners' rediscovered willing ness to negotiate. The parties thereby agreed on the timeliness of overcoming the contentious issue of the decimals in the cost-of-living index by: (i) reintroducing into the pay packet the two additional contested points in the index, the one in May and the other in September; (ii) paying a compensatory one-off amount of 100 000 lira in two part payments of 50 000 lira each with the September and December 1986 pay packets. This same principle was subse quently adopted by the Confagicoltura (20 May) and the Confapi (24 May) agreements. The agreement was necessary to clarify uncertainties concerning the ap plication of the agreement of 22 January 1983 between the government and the social partners and of the draft agree ment of 12 February 1984. The agree ment also provided the opportunity for laying down a regulation to accelerate the procedure for approving training- cum-work contracts for member com panies of Confindustria. Italy: Fiscalization of social security contributions (DL No 328) The decree-law No 328 of 3 July 1986 proposes the same reliefs in social security contributions which had been fixed with the two preceding decree laws: DL 34 of 20 February 1986 (see In- formisep No 14) and DL No 123 of 26 April 1986. The application of the mea sure has been extended to 30 Novem ber 1986. The rates of the relief are fixed at: 1.60 points for male personnel; 4.00 points for female personnel. The additional reliefs have been maintained at 5.24 points for industrial and craft firms in manufacturing and mining and for firms in the mechanical engineering sector, and at 2.54 points for companies operating in the Mezzo giorno. In agriculture the additional relief has been maintained at 17.50%. Netherlands: Draft resolution on assistance to the self-employed In the future, interest-bearing loans granted to the self-employed to provide them with working capital will be limited to HFL 200 000. If the self-employed person's own assets are valued at more than HFL 250 000, assistance will no longer be given in the form of a non-refundable capital grant, but as a loan which will bear interest once the assistance granted has expired. If the self-employed person's assets are more than HFL 75 700 but less than HFL 250 000, he/she will be given a non-refundable capital grant only if his/ her own funds amount to less than 30% of the total investment. As a rule the subsistence allowance is paid to the self-employed person at the outset as an interest-free loan. Sub sequently a settlement is made taking into account the actually earned income. If the income in the first two years following the granting of the loan has re mained below the assistance level, relief in interest charges may be granted. Aid to the unemployed Spain: Revision of the regulation governing 'community' work The Basic Employment Law of 8 Oc tober 1980, amended by law 31/1984 of 2 August on unemployment protection, instituted works of social assistance. This allows works and services of public interest and social value to be carried out by unemployed persons receiving 97 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE compensation under the unemployment insurance or the unemployment assist ance scheme. To this effect the public administrations can request INEM to provide the unemployed workers they need on condition that the jobs pro posed are of social value, benefit the community, are temporary, correspond to the person's physical ability and oc cupational skills and do not involve a change of regular residence. If the worker in receipt of unemploy ment benefits does not accept the pro posed job, benefit rights will be sus pended for six months for a first refusal and will be cancelled altogether in the case of a second refusal. INEM pays the unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. This sum will be topped up by the public administrations to the ref erence amount on which the calculation of the amount of benefit is based, or to the collective wage, depending on each case; the public administration will also cover travelling expenses the workers might incur and take over the corre sponding contributions for accidents at work and occupational diseases. The government has just approved an amendment to the regulation govern ing 'community work' on the duration and workers' remuneration. Firstly, whilst maintaining the temporary nature of such jobs, the amendment provides for the possibility of a longer duration than that previously foreseen, i.e. five months, the maximum duration allowed being that which the worker needs to be entitled to unemployment benefit or un employment assistance. Secondly, the public administrations will top up the un employment compensation to the refer ence amount on which the contribution- related benefit is based which the worker receives or received before com ing under the assistance scheme, with a guaranteed minimum amount equal to 100% of the national minimum wage in force at any one time. Netherlands: Bill on unpaid work for persons in receipt of benefit The intention of the Bill on unpaid work for persons in receipt of benefit (WOAU) is two-fold: on the one hand, to make working whilst in receipt of benefit legal; for many jobseekers want to do unpaid work as long as they do not have a paid job. On the other, a monitor ing procedure will be introduced to en sure that doing unpaid work will have no detrimental consequences on others. WOAU provides for the establish ment of a number of regional inspection committees to approve or reject applica tions tor doing work whilst in receipt of benefit. Such activities are only ap proved if they entail no distortion in competition or lead to regular workers being made redundant. The inspection committees will be composed of representatives of trade unions and employers' organizations, of all municipalities in the region and of or ganizations involved in activities for the unemployed. Anyone considering that his interests have been damaged through such jobs or through the per mission of carrying out unpaid work, can appeal to the committee and subse quently to one of the five review commit tees to be set up. Under the WOAU persons who can claim benefits and have been registered at the regional employment office (GAB) for over a year will be allowed to work whilst in receipt of benefit. In principle, the authorization for doing unpaid work is valid for one year. The validity of the law has been provi sionally fixed at four years. Training Spain: Establishment of the General Council for Vocational Training The General Council for Vocational Training (CGFP) was set up on 26 June in accordance with law 1/1986 of 7 Jan uary. It is an advisory body to the gov ernment on both 'regulated' vocational training (i.e. that which falls under the re gulations of the Ministry of Education and Science (formaci\u00f3n profesional reg lada) and recurrent vocational training (formaci\u00f3n profesional ocupacional, see Informisep 14). Council members represent institu tions: 13 representatives each of the most representative employer and trade union organizations as well as 13 from public administration. The last are drawn from the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, of Education and Science, of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, of In dustry and Energy, of the Prime Minis ter's Office, of Economics and Finance, of Culture and of Defence. During the first year of operations the Council will be chaired by the Minis ter for Labour and Social Security, who will subsequently rotate on an annual basis with the Minister for Education and Science. Two plenary meetings have so far been held. The second was devoted to drafting the Council's by-laws which must now be submitted by the two min isters to the government for its approval. These by-laws lay down that the Council will operate in plenary sessions and as a standing committee in addition to which there will be working groups. The standing committee will be made up of four representatives each of trade unions and of the employers elected from among the plenary members. Plenary meetings will be held at least twice a year and the standing com mittee will come together at least once a month. Decisions will be taken by an ab solute majority of those present. Spain: Taller' schools 'Taller' schools are vocational train ing centres mainly for young people. They can contribute to work schemes promoted by any kind of institution with a view to providing integrated training for young people. This integrated train ing combines practical experience on the scheme with theoretical training, opening up access for the young per son to stable employment. These schools are thus employment-cum- training centres having four aims: (1) to facilitate the integration of young unemployed people into working life 98 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES by providing them with training and some work experience; (2) to train specialists for some vanish ing crafts for which there is still some demand and some specialists who are holders of a degree to en able them to find jobs as wage- earners, self-employed or members of a cooperative society; (3) to promote the restoration and con servation of the artistic, architectural and physical environment, thus con tributing to make the cultural heritage better known; (4) to stimulate and start up various art istic, cultural and social activities by making them known and heighten ing awareness of them. For their work of restoring the histor ical, artistic, cultural and natural heritage in question, 'Taller' schools are able to draw on the aid provided by municipal authorities, the autonomous communi ties and other institutions through their own investment budgets. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security provides the requisite resources for the establish ment and smooth functioning of the schools through additional and coordi nated activities of the Solidarity Fund for Employment and INEM, the national em ployment institute. The 'Taller' schools are involved in the areas of restoring ar chitectural and archeological sites, crafts, ceramics and the environment. 'Taller' schools' vocational training and integration of students in the labour market takes place in three steps which combine measures for training and em ployment promotion: (1) During the first stage (four months) students aged between 16 and 25 years rece ve a study grant and as such do not have an employment contract. These grants are given by the Solidarity Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. This is a training stage of initiation and quali fying. (2) During the second stage (eight months) students become student- workers spending one part of the day working and the other undertak ing qualifying and specialization training. The wages of the student- workers are paid by INEM by virtue of an agreement concluded with lo cal corporations for 1986. This stage can subsequently be extended by new arrangements. (3) During the third and final stage, stu dent-workers can use their training to become wage-earners in enter prises specialized in restoration or set up as groups of self-employed workers within a cooperative or any other type of enterprise entitled to offer their services both to local units as well as to individual initia tives. For this purpose the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has developed a set of incentives aimed at facilitating their vocational integra tion. Each 'Taller' school consists of one or more training modules. Each module has 24 students. There are four teachers for theoretical subjects and four voca tional training instructors or monitors for practical training. Each 'Taller schools furthermore has a director of training, a studies' tutor and a tutor for practical training. The overall 'Taller' schools' pro gramme has developed in two phases. The first started in February 1986 with the approval of 37 schools. In June 1986 the second phase got under way with the recognition of a further 77 schools and the extension of 7 of the first. A total of 5184 students has been trained by 1 959 teachers. The budget earmarked for the two phases is 11 993 million pe setas of which 6 500 million come from various local and regional administra tions, 2 100 million from INEM and 3 393 million from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (Social Fund for Employ ment). The average annual training cost per student is 65 400 pesetas. France: Preliminary evaluation of 'modular traineeships' In July 1985, the Minister for Labour, Employment and Vocational Training decided to launch training and aid ac tion for the vocational integration of job seekers. Priority was given to those who, enrolled at ANPE (the national em ployment agency) for more than one year, were experiencing problems in finding work. At the same time the aim was also to respond better to the needs of enterprises hiring them. Within this context, ANPE was given the job of putting on 50 000 'stages modulaires'. Lasting some 600 hours on average (which varies from 300 to 1 200 hours according to the needs), these modular traineeships meet a set of cri teria laid down by ANPE on the basis of an analysis of the difficulties of re integration and local employment opportunities. The aim is to build up, with the train ees in question, a 'path to integration' passing through various stages of eval uation, 'retraining' for employment, broadening knowledge, training periods within enterprises and help in job search. With this in mind, the training body (or the enterprise) in question must design a method for training and help towards vocational integration which at the same time takes account of the real situation of the users so as to meet their needs and is adapted to lo cally available employment openings. Setting up a coherent system of evaluation This scheme, which reached some 70 000 job seekers in 1985, brought about the setting up of an evaluation system to appraise the extent to which the objectives were being achieved, the methods used as well as their relevance and effectiveness. Thus, two files are opened at the be ginning of each traineeship. One con cerns the main characteristics of the traineeship: name of the training body, number of trainees, length of the trainee- ship. The other is for each trainee. These individual files enable both a sta tistical analysis to be made of the char acteristics of the trainees and an enquiry to be launched on what happens to a sample of trainees. 99 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE Copyright Irish Times A qualitative follow-up of the imple mentation of the measure in four regions (Upper Normandy, Rhone Alpes, Nord- Pas-de-Calais and Paris) is being car ried out by four research teams and ANPE's directorate of studies. First lessons from the preliminary evaluation The preliminary evaluation of the measure carried out jointly by ANPE's directorate of studies and statistics and that of actions ('interventions') brings out that: very different training bodies have responded to the call for tender launched by ANPE: AFPA (the adult vocational training association), GRETA (the group of training esta blishments), independent bodies of the chambers of industry and com merce, professional bodies, joint training bodies and enterprises; the quantitative objectives were reached: more than 79 000 trainees really did start on a traineeship over an eight-month period. Furthermore, it is clear that training has been given to the target group in line with the objectives; (iii) to help the integration of adults since the majority of trainees (86%) are aged between 25 and 50 years, with 20% more than 40 years and 40% more than 50 years; (iv) to help the target groups facing inte gration problems, in particular women, since a majority of women (57%) has entered modular trainee- ships; (v) to give priority to the long-term un employed since a majority (55%) of trainees has been registered be tween one and two years at ANPE, but 35% have been so for more than two years ; (vi) to give priority to enhancing the vo cational skills of those needing them most (since 87% of the train ees had a training level between VI andV); (vii) to take account of all types of skills which are neeced by companies. Thus, 35% of the participants were skilled employees, 18.5% skilled workers and 42% had no qualifica tions at the outset. The training periods organized ap pear to have focused on three main types of approaches according to the characteristics of the target group and the nature of the objectives striven for. These were: (i) 'insertion' training periods aimed at re-instilling trainees with confidence and synergy, emphasizing both re training for employment, particularly through in-company traineeships and upgrading their general and vo cational level; Level V corresponds to leaving school after the last class of the first cycle of secondary edu cation or giving up the short form of the second cycle of secondary education before the terminal year. Level VI corresponds to those leaving the first cycle of secondary education before the last year, those leaving vocational education lasting one year or education of the 'lightened' or prac tical type. 100 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES (ii) specialization traineeships focused on jobs available and technical knowledge; (iii) vocationally broadening training periods emphasizing the hetero geneous character of the groups and aiming to impact on vocational mobility by moving towards adja cent occupations through the trans ferability of skills. Furthermore, despite some problems in implementing the programme (for in stance, as regards learning as such, given the current situation as regards the supply of training, there are some obstacles, essentially organizational, limiting the development of the individu alization and the modularization of the training), the result of the scheme has been positive, provided that its original character is kept. Moreover, in addition to the consider able mobilization of all those concerned at various levels and the recognition of the firm as a training place, the following should be pointed out: (i) that the open and positive stance of firms towards the scheme contri butes in particular to modifying the often negative image which the company manager has towards job seekers and to associating the en terprise both socially and economi cally in the reintegration of the un employed; (ii) that significant behavioural changes have taken place in the majority of trainees who have reasserted their self-image and thus have been able to find entry points which previously seemed to be beyond their grasp (the training period itself being structured as a cluster of resources with an emerging spirit of mutual help and solidarity); (iii) that the strong commitment of train ing bodies to the training objectives and structures proposed (individual ization, modularization, hetero geneity of the trainees, alternance) augurs profound change within the landscape of the supply of training as well as in the development of the relationships between employment technicians and trainers. Ireland: Youth traineeship initiative AnCO \u2014 The Industrial Training Authority have introduced on a pilot ba sis a youth traineeship initiative in two areas, one rural and one urban. The tar get set for each area is to achieve 80 employer/employee training agree ments. The objective of this scheme is to fill a gap in the training needs of young people in first-time employment whose jobs do not provide any real opportunity of structured training. This is particularly relevant to the needs of early school- leavers with little or no qualifications. The main elements of the scheme are: (1) Training agreements will be ar ranged between each participating employer and employee. (2) Training will consist of two ele ments: (i) 'on-the-job' training provided by the employer with assistance from AnCO on programme struc tures and content. (ii) 'off-the-job' training provided through a combination of AnCO training centres and local edu cational-colleges (Regional Tech nical Colleges, Vocational Edu cational Committees, etc.). Progress and effectiveness in the operation of this pilot scheme will be considered in 1987. Netherlands: Management course for women re-entering the labour market The Centres for Administrative Vo cational Training for Adults (CAVVs) which are the training institutions of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employ ment, will soon be organizing courses in the field of management. These will be aimed at 'reintegrating' women, i.e. helping women who have not done any paid work for a number of years and are looking again for a job on the labour market. The courses are organized in connection with an experiment which was carried out in East-Groningen in the autumn of 1985. The experiment has shown that former course participants have succeeded very quickly in finding a paid job. The courses are essentially geared to the requirements of working-life and last for six months. Subjects dealt with are job-hunting, marketing, financial management, informatics and skills in social matters. Lessons are given in 10 blocks, each of four days with a concluding traineeship in a company. Participation is open to women be tween 25 and 40 years of age who are looking for a job and who have at least a higher vocational education (HBO) background. Courses are free of charge, the costs being borne by the Ministry's Directorate-General for Manpower. United Kingdom: Developments in vocational education and training On 2 July, the UK Government pub lished a White Paper' which made two major announcements concerning vo cational education and training. The first is the intention to make the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative avail able to all 14\u201418 year olds in Great Bri tain; the second is the establishment of a National Council for Vocational Qualifi cations. Technical and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI) TVEI was launched in 1983, to widen and enrich the curriculum for 14\u201418 year olds of all abilities. Each education authority in Great Britain has been given the opportunity to run a pilot scheme to ' 'Working together \u2014 education and training' (CMND9823). 101 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE Copyright REA/P. Nieto explore and test ways of stimulating the provision of technical and vocational education. There are currently 74 pro jects involving nearly 40 000 pupils in some 500 schools and colleges. By 1987, 98 of the 116 authorities will be in volved, and over 100 000 pupils are likely to benefit from the pilot schemes, at a total programme cost of around UKL 250 million. From the pupil's point of view, the main features of TVEI are its emphasis on practical learning using problem- solving techniques and the close rela tion between the curriculum and the world outside the school. TVEI aims to equip young people more effectively for entry into employment at whatever age they decide to leave full time education. The TVEI projects have been popular with pupils whilst at the same time cap turing the enthusiasm and commitment of both teachers and education authori ties. The extension of TVEI will begin in 1987 and the Government has commit ted itself to substantial funding for this development averaging UKL 90 million a year over the next 10 years. The exten sion, like the pilot phase, will be admin istered by the Manpower Services Com mission in close association with the Education Departements. All education authorities in Great Britain will be invited to take part. It is seen as a significant step towards the Government's objec tive that all young people in schools should have the opportunity of following a more relevant and practical curriculum leading to the achievement of reorga nized standards of competence and qualifications. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) In 1985, the Government established a Working Group to review vocational qualifications in England and Wales. Its remit was to put forward proposals de signed to bring coherence, and compre- hensibility to a system which was over due for reform. Emphasis was also to be placed on the need for accessibility and progression within the system, together with the demand that qualifications should reflect a person's competence and capability in the application of knowledge and skill. The main recommendations of that Working Group have now been taken up by the Government, which has decided to bring vocational qualifications in Eng land, Wales and Northern Ireland within 102 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES a new national framework to be called the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ). It will also be setting up this au tumn a new National Council for Voca tional Qualifications (NCVQ) to develop the NVQ framework. The NVQ framework will initially con sist of four levels. Each level will reflect increasingly complex levels of practical competence as well as theoretical knowledge \u2014 from that needed for jobs now entered by 16 and 17 years olds up to that required at higher technician le vel or equivalent. The standards these qualifications represent will then be ap parent and the routes of progression to other full or part qualifications will be come clear. The aim is to have the new four-level framework in operation by 1991, and to begin discussions immedi ately to clarify the relationship between these levels and higher professional qualifications. The new National Council will pro mote quality and the recognition of competence in the field of qualifications. It will also accredit qualifications to form part of the new framework. So the Coun cil will not itself be an examining or vali dating body. The existing bodies will continue to develop their qualifications, and if the qualifications satisfy National Council criteria they will be accredited for a limited number of years, and as signed to one of the levels of the frame work. The National Council will have a ba sic annual budget in the initial years of some UKL 3 million. The Government will provide pump-priming funding but the aim will be for the National Council to become self-sufficient after three years, from income received from bod ies whose qualifications it accredits. United Kingdom: College of the Air The Government has announced plans for an open college, the College of the Air. It is hoped that it will be able to start broadcasting from September 1987. Both radio and television will be used to help deliver and support open learning courses in all areas of voca tional competence. Aim The aim of the college would be to promote a large-scale increase in access to open learning, providing up to one million people with training opportu nities within the first five years. Both em ployed and unemployed people could benefit from a wide range of general and specialist vocational training courses. The development would thus extend to a new and much wider audience the benefits of open learning, which takes education and training outside the classroom and puts the student in con trol of his or her own studies. The col lege would build upon previous devel opments in open and distance learning \u2014 particularly the Government's Open Tech programme \u2014 and upon the expe rience of educational broadcasters and private and public sector colleges in volved in open learning techniques. Structure The college itself would be a com pany limited by guarantee, registered as a charity and independent of govern ment. It would attract industrial and commercial sponsorship and become self-financing. It is intended that the col lege should have access to as many television and radio stations as possi ble, to ensure its needs for a wide audi ence are met. Both the Independent Broadcasting Association and the BBC have expressed a willingness to be in volved in the project, as have a number of companies, and discussions are pro ceeding on how best to pursue these opportunities. A small central unit would bring to gether into active collaboration those or ganizations already involved in open learning including broadcasters, col leges and employers. Through them the Unit would make use of existing training, information and marketing materials and develop new ones. It would also arrange for students' enrolment, tutor support, practical training facilities and assess ment and certification of performance. The college would work to ensure that the highest quality of materials and sup port services was maintained and achieved. Courses Over the initial five years it is hoped that a full range of courses would be de veloped in such broad areas as: (i) basic education, including training for learning and attracting students back into vocational education and training; (ii) general education, including lan guages, general science and health, leisure and welfare; (iii) subjects of general interest, includ ing budgeting, consumer rights; (iv) vocational education and training, including support and encourage ment for the would-be entrepreneur, and new technology skills; (v) technical and business updating provision, including in-service teacher training in key and shortage skills. Students would be able to choose which courses they wanted to under take, paying for materials, tutor support, assessment and certification services to the extent that they needed them. They could be funded by their employers, or if unemployed, by government training schemes, and would be able to gain a qualification or a credit towards one where these were relevant. Next steps The next step will be for the Govern ment to appoint a Chairman for the col lege. His or her first task will be to hold detailed discussions with interested parties with the aim of drawing up more definite plans for the formation and de velopment of the college. It is hoped that these will be announced later this year. United Kingdom: Career development loans The UK Government is testing de mand from individuals for a greater role 103 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE in choosing their own training courses. Career development loans are intended to make it easier for people to undertake training of their own choice independ ently of an employer or the government. A three-year pilot project was launched on 15 April by the Secretary of State for Employment. Initially it is op erating in four areas (Aberdeen, Bristol and Bath, Greater Manchester and Reading and Slough) selected to reflect socioeconomic variations in the UK as a whole. Unlike many training schemes there are very few conditions attached to the scheme. Anyone over 18 who lives in or intends to train in one of the four pilot areas can apply for a loan, provided the course is vocational and likely to im prove their employment prospects. They must intend to work in the UK or else where in the EEC after the course and must not be receiving any government grant for education or training or any help from an employer for the course. The scheme is administered for the Government by three commercial banks: Barclays and the Clydesdale in Aberdeen, and Barclays and the Coop erative in the three English pilot areas. Their local manager decides whether or not the applicant is eligible and whether he or she is likely to be able to repay the loan. So far, nearly 6 000 information packs have been distributed to people seeking further information. Question naires to a sample of these suggest that some 14% have taken out a loan or are thinking of doing so. A further 14% have yet to decide. Comments from all re spondents were overwhelmingly favou rable suggesting that there is a signifi cant interest in this more independent approach to training. Of the approved loans notified so far by the banks to the Department of Em ployment an equal number are from those in work and those who are unem ployed. (The scheme is open to both.) A wide range of courses are being taken from chiropody to computer program ming. The average length of the courses so far is 31 weeks and the average size of loan nearly UKL 2 000. Most of these trainees are taking full-time courses and the proportion of men to women is about 3:1. The Department is arranging a fol low-up survey of trainees after the end of their 'repayment holiday', that is the period during which the Government pays the interest on the loan (the length of the course plus up to a further three months). The repayment holiday is the key incentive for potential trainees and makes the cost of borrowing signifi cantly cheaper than for normal personal bank loans. Career development loans have been publicized through advertising on local radio and in local newspapers, using a Freefone and Freepost facility to obtain further information. Direct contact with local training providers is thought to be a key way of reaching potential trainees who may have had difficulty in obtaining funds from other sources. The banks taking part publicize the scheme through leaflets in their branches and at local exhibitions. The Department itself is able to arrange publicity through min isterial visits, articles and its Action for Jobs Campaign. Job creation Italy: Programme to encourage initiatives aimed at enhancing and salvaging cultural assets Article 15 of Law No 41 of 28 Febru ary 1986 concerned the areas of priority for initiatives aimed at enhancing and salvaging cultural assets. By a decree of 27 March 1986 the Minister for Cultural Assets and the Environment, in agree ment with the Minister for Labour and Social Security, approved the pro gramme guidelines for interventions. This decree specifies that projects are eligible which: (i) provide for companies or consor tiums of companies to be entrusted with the execution; (ii) aim at enhancing cultural assets in areas foreseen under Article 15, Law 41/86; (iii) aim at creating additional employ ment, by young persons under 29 years of age who have been unem ployed for more than 12 months being recruited under a limited term contract. These workers may be chosen directly by the employer (un like the normal arrangement which obliges the employer to accept the candidates proposed by the labour exchange). Technicians and gradu ates who are older than 29 years and have already worked on cultural assets can also be hired; (iv) set out the contents and arrange ments of the training activities in tended for the recruits; (v) make use of'new'technologies; (vi) foresee a minimum duration of six months and a maximum of 36 months and costs of not less than 3 000 million lira and not more than 50 000 million lira; (vii) are immediately feasible. The request for finance had to be submitted not later than 31 May 1986 to the Ministry of Cultural Assets and the Environment and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, containing all infor mation necessary, as set out in the de cree, for the project to be approved. A special committee, set up ad hoc by decree of 21 March 1986 checks on adherence to the eligibility conditions and monitors the effects of the project on enhancing cultural assets, reducing youth unemployment, using the most advanced technologies, and contribut ing to economic development, by apply ing cultural, employment, technological, economic, quality and reliability param eters. Portugal: LEIs IEFP supports DN No 46/86 of June 1986 lays down the first legal framework for local em ployment initiatives. It sets out the con- 104 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES ditions for drawing technical and finan cial help from the IEFP, the national em ployment and vocational training insti tute. Priority in support is given to pro jects fitting the following situations: (a) highest percentage of applicants looking for their first job and unem ployed persons to be hired in the LEI; (b) highest percentage of persons cooperating in, associated with or partners of the total initiative; (c) location within regions most af fected by unemployment or least favoured by economic and social development; (d) the lowest capital-intensity of the in vestment envisaged. Absolute priority will, however, be given to projects meeting conditions (a) and (b) taken together. DN No 46/86 also foresees the eval uation of the results of actions being un dertaken on the basis of annual reports. Special categories of workers Denmark: Women in the labour force In the public debate which has been taking place in Denmark over the last decade, the increase in unemployment has been linked with women's entry to the labour market. In the last year, devel opments have shown that the rising em ployment has only had a minor impact upon women's unemployment. By the end of 1983 there were some 2.6 million Danish females. Half were in the labour force. Of the 1.3 million out side the labour force a little more than 1 million were not economically active because they were children, young per sons undergoing education or training, or elderly persons receiving pension or voluntary early retirement pay. The re maining 1/4 million women outside the labour force were not economically ac tive without belonging to any of these categories. This last category of women outside the labour force must thus be more or less identical with the group of women working in the home. About 100 000 women in the labour force were employed in their own or their husband's business. Furthermore, there were about 130 000 unemployed women. This means that there were just over 1 million female employees in employ ment. Of these a little more than 700 000 were working full-time, while more than 300 000 were working part-time. Since 1977 the unemployment rate of women has been higher than that of men, but the number of unemployed women only exceeded the number of unemployed men in one year before 1984. That was in 1979 when the intro duction of the voluntary early retirement pay scheme removed a considerably larger part of male unemployment than of female unemployment. Female unemployment not only dif fers quantitatively from that of men \u2014 it is also different in its structure since it is somewhat more concentrated. This is reflected in the fact that the average de gree of unemployment was significantly larger for women than for men. On the other hand, there is no difference as re gards the average number of unemploy ment periods. The fact that women are experien cing a disproportionately large share of unemployment and that female unem ployment is concentrated on a compara tively small number of persons means that there is a group of women shoul dering a very large share of total unem ployment. Thus about 125 000 women were unemployed for more than half of 1984. Germany: Enhancing the employment opportunities of the severely handicapped The Federal Parliament ('Bundestag') has passed a Bill on the revision of the Act on the Severely Disabled. The most important goal of the amendment is to enhance the hiring and employment op portunities of the severely disabled on the employment and training places market. The new Act includes the following changes: (\u00a1) The concept of 'reduction of earning capacity' ('Minderung der Er werbsf\u00e4higkeit') has been replaced by that of 'degree of disablement' ('Grad der Behinderung'). This is be cause the former was misleading and hampered employability. (ii) Employers who fail to meet their legal obligation to employ the se verely disabled or do not employ the required quota have to pay a compensatory levy. The monthly amount of this levy for each compul sory job has been increased from DM 100 to DM 150. This increase is in line with the rise in gross income since 1974. The intention is to get employers to hire and employ the severely disabled to the prescribed quota of 6% of those employed by the enterprise. The levy should also create cost compensation between those em ployers who employ the severely disabled and those who do not comply with hiring requirements and thereby have cost advantages. With out the adjustment made by the law, the compensatory levy could not properly fulfil its functions. (iii) Training places are no longer to be counted in the computation of the number of jobs which have to be re served for the severely disabled. The aim here is to increase the wil lingness of enterprises to provide training. The job quota for the se verely is 6% of all employees, so that as from 16 jobs there must be at least one reserved for a severely disabled person. Assistance to the severely disabled undergoing training ('Azubis') is be ing increased. Generally speaking, one severely disabled Azubi should 105 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE Copyright REA/D. Maillac count for two compulsory places. This rule is valid until 31 December 1989. (iv) The special protection against dis missing the severely disabled re mains in force. However, to provide employers with the opportunity of testing a severely disabled person on a given job, the special protec tion against dismissal has been adapted to the general one. Thus, the special protection against dis missal of the severely disabled will, as with the general dismissal pro tection, come into force after six months of employment. Special protection against dismissal remains necessary. But it could im pact negatively on hirings if it comes into operation too early and im pedes employers from testing suffi ciently the severely disabled in spe cific jobs. Hence special protection against dismissal is being adapted in its time dimension to general dis missal protection. (v) The hiring and employment of the severely disabled is being finan cially supported by the compensa tory levy. Support from the compen satory levy will be given in priority to those groups of the severely dis abled who because of their disable ment have particular problems on the employment and training market. Those falling into this category are the severely disabled who could not do a job without additional assist ance (visual and movement aids). Furthermore, employers will be reimbursed for the additional costs incurred by employing a particularly badly disabled person (costs for a personal reader for blind people). In this way the good experience gleaned from the previous four spe cial programme is turned into reli able permanent ailes. (vi) The legal status of the representa tive for the severely disabled has been strengthened. The representa tive is given the right of participating in checking whether vacant jobs can be filled by the unemployed who are severely disabled. In this way he/ she can contribute to the severely disabled being offered a job or train ing place. France: Employment measures for 16-25 year-olds On 16 July 1986, the Minister for So cial Affairs and Employment submitted to the Council of Ministers a draft ordi- 106 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES nance on the employment of young people between 16 and 25 years of age. This was an application of the Law of 2 July 1986 authorizing the government to take various economic and social measures. Since every third unemployed per son is under 25 years of age, the fight against youth unemployment is a na tional priority. I. This scheme mobilizes significant resources FF 4 billion (bn) were allotted under the modified finance law adopted by parliament. This amount is added to funds already earmarked for the long- term unemployed, in particular adults, representing a total effort for 1986 alone of FF 4.5 bn. II. This plan relies on enterprises In order to encourage enterprises to make massive hirings of young people and to participate in their training, social security exemptions are being granted by the State for each wage-earner or trainee between 16 and 25 years of age recruited. There are three cases of exemption: (1) Exemption of 25% on employers' contributions to social security for each hiring of a young person between 1 May 1986 and 31 January 1987. This relief holds until 30 June 1987. (2) Exemption of 50% of the same con tributions for any hiring of a young person during the three months fol lowing the end of an apprenticeship contract, alternance training, a train ing period for a young long-term un employed person or extended mili tary service with vocational training. This exemption, valid for training completed by 30 June 1987, holds for all hirings made from 1 June 1986 for the whole of the year follow ing the recruitment. To enable this scheme to get under way without delay, the exemption is increased to 100% for the 30 days following the publication of the ordi nance. (3) Exemption of 100% of employers' contributions to social security for all apprenticeship or alternance training contracts ('adaptation' or 'qualification' contracts). Further more, no employer or employee contribution is due on the supple mentary allowance paid by the em ployer to persons finishing within the enterprise a training period pro viding initiation into working life. The length of these training periods will moreover be increased to six months. As from the publication of the ordi nance, this 100% exemption will hold for all contracts in operation and new con tracts concluded by January 1987. III. The formalities which enterprises have to comply with in order to benefit from these aids have been deliberately cut down All employers (enterprises and in dividuals) compulsorily insured with Unedic (the national social security ad ministration) can claim these exemp tions. Only the State, local communities and public establishments for adminis tration are excluded. For the employer, the administrative formalities consist of a declaration to the d\u00e9partemental directorate of labour and employment within 15 days following the hiring and of a deduction of the amount of the exemptions at the time of the normal payment of contributions to the URSSAF. These exemptions are reimbursed by the State to the Social Security. Finally, the arrangements for alter nance training, including apprentice ship, are simplified at the same time. They are in particular being opened without any restrictions to all those aged 16-25 years. This whole set of measures should enable enterprises to participate effec tively in the national effort for employing young people. Ireland: Survey of the young long-term unemployed The Youth Employment Agency (YEA) have recently published the re sults of another survey on young people. This survey which was con ducted by the Economic and Social Re search Institute (ESRI) on behalf of the YEA examines the young long-term un employed, their characteristics, labour market and training experiences and use and attitude to State manpower and training programmes. The survey was carried out in May and June 1985 using a random sample of young people aged between 19 and 25 years who were unemployed for more than a year. One of the most significant findings of the survey was that the young long- term unemployed tend to be the unqual ified and lesser qualified early school- leavers. (This confirms one of the find ings of the YEA follow-up survey of 1981/82 leavers.) The results of the sur vey also indicate that the young long- term unemployed come from families which encounter well above average levels of unemployment and that these young people are predominantly male, single and in their early twenties. The survey also showed that the young long-term unemployed have few skills. Only slightly over one-third had received training since leaving school and participation on State work experi ence and temporary employment schemes was found to be low. The young long-term unemployed do not appear to have high career aspirations, the majority of those looking for work at the time of the survey were seeking rela tively unskilled jobs, those who had been previously employed had occu pied such jobs. Other findings of the survey were: (i) the average duration of unemploy ment was around two and a half years; (ii) over half of the respondents had not been unemployed prior to their cur rent spell of unemployment; (iii) just over a quarter had never worked since leaving school. 107 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE Italy: Implementation of the special youth employment scheme provided for under Law No 113 of 11 April 1986 The decree implementing the spe cial youth employment scheme, pro vided for by Law No 113 of 11 April 1986 was passed on 23 June 1986. The decree elucidates the opera tional details for enforcing the law. Un der Article 1 it reaffirms that projects for hiring workers by means of a training- work contract can be submitted by pri vate firms, public enterprises and their consortiums, as well as by associations and foundations carrying out research or providing technical assistance to companies. Persons to be hired for the projects must be aged between 18 and 29 years and have been registered at the employ ment office for at least 12 months. Pro jects have to specify the time to be de voted to training and work and the way in which training and work activities are to be carried out. They furthermore have to outline the training programmes and indicate what vocational qualifications are to be acquired. Projects have to be submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security whose approval takes account of the advice of the Technical Evaluation Committee with respect to the priority criteria fixed by law No 113/86 and detailed in the implementing decree. According to the criteria laid down in the decree of implementation, priority is given to projects which: (i) are to be carried out in provinces where the rate of youth unemploy ment is higher than the average re gional rate; (ii) provide for hiring women for jobs leading to managerial positions, for which a university-level diploma is required with technical and indus trial qualifications; (iii) provide for the recruitment of man power with higher education for highly specialized jobs which imply a training programme of at least 200 hours of technical training in new technologies and a diploma of not less than higher secondary educa tion level; (iv) foresee the recruitment of workers from particularly disadvantaged groups, such as young persons who have been unemployed for more than two years, young person as heads of household without any income, or young disabled persons; and (v) which are prepared in agreement with the regional associations of trade unions or of the categories of workers who are members of the most representative organizations on the national level; such agree ments have to be backed up by a requisite declaration of the parties concerned. Netherlands: Act on work for the disabled (WAGW) The Act on work for the disabled (WAGW) came into operation on 1 July 1986. This law obliges employers, em ployers' organizations and trade unions to take action within three years at the latest aimed at maintaining or (reinte grating disabled workers into working life. If they fail to do this or do it only in sufficiently, the employers will be com pelled to employ a certain quota of dis abled workers. This quota ranges from a minimum of 3% to a maximum of 7%. The purpose of the WAGW is to fos ter and ensure the participation of the handicapped in working life. It further more aims at reducing the number of disabled who have to depend on social berefits. The law improves the opportunities for the disabled to enter working life dur ing the first year of sickness. Any em ployer who refuses to offer suitable work in the first year of sickness can now, through a modification of the Sickness Benefits Act, be forced by the industrial insurance board to pay the wages not paid. The act contains a clause enabling an allowance to be granted for adapting the workplace and corporate facilities in line with the possibilities of the dis abled. In this context the package of measures provided for under the Gen eral Disablement Benefits Act (AAW) and under the laws on State pensions has been broadened. Working time Netherlands: Reductions in working time A survey of Dutch enterprises shows that in about 40% of enterprises, cover ing some 70% of all persons employed, working time reductions were made in early 1985. It is mainly the small com panies which have not yet introduced working time reductions. The form most frequently used is the so-called 'roostervrij' (off-duty periods) which means a reduction in working time over two weeks, one month or over one year. The overall impression of the employers asked was that the average compensatory hiring for all enterprises amounted to 20% or 25% in early 1985. The employment effects of working time reductions seem to increase with the size of the companies. Netherlands: Educational leave in collective agreements (CAOs) A recently published report indicates that most collective agreements contain provisions on education/training leave for employees. Some provisions apply to all employees and others to specific groups of employees. In most of the col lective agreements concerned the em ployer continues to pay the salary dur ing the leave. The report surveys the clauses on education and training. In virtually all cases the employees can have leave to participate in a vocational training course or to take a vocational exam. 108 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE MEMBER STATES Some collective agreements also con tain clauses on general courses and/or exams. Many collective agreements in clude clauses on educating and training young persons. This mostly consists of one day's paid leave for taking part in schooling, mainly vocational training and in a number of cases general edu cation. Placement Germany: Equality of treatment in the placement activities of the public employment service BA, the Federal Employment Insti tute, has introduced some new regula tions on equality of treatment for male and female applicants for jobs and train ing places. The original idea came from the Federal Ministry of Labour. This min istry welcomes the advances contained in the new regulation to pay still more attention than previously to the basic legislation on the equality of treatment between men and women in BA's place ment activities. BA's now circular lays down that job and training placement should be guided above all by the aptitudes of the job-seeker and should not take into consideration the person's sex. Even when an employer gives instructions to look for only a man or a woman, the placement officer is required to make suggestions for jobs and training places without reference to the sex of the per son. The most appropriate candidate, irrespective of sex, should be given a chance. This is for the benefit of both those seeking and offering jobs and training places. As regards placement for train ing in particular the range of occupa tions for young women can be broad ened, for at present employers only offer them a part of the available training openings. To achieve the aim of placement which takes no account of the sex of the applicant, BA is stepping up its efforts to ensure that its officers are even more knowledgeable of the rules or equality of treatment laid down in the Civil Code. These rules prohibit sexual discrimina tion when hiring, promoting and dis missing employees. Vacancies will in future be publicized without reference to the sex of the person. France: Ulysse \u2014 A computerized service on specialized job offers ANPE, the national employment ag ency, has started jointly with the T\u00e9l\u00e9 syst\u00e8me company a computerized ser vice on specialized job offers: Ulysse. This is aimed at enhancing its service to key economic users and sectors. Through a nationwide network, Ulysse will significantly contribute to fill highly qualified vacancies or those from specific industries, these at the moment being air transport, cultural jobs, the press, health care, agriculture and teaching as well as job offers for manag ers, engineers and technicians. The aim of the scheme is two-fold to enable: (i) on the one hand, job-seekers to ex tend, rapidly and effectively, their search to the national level, both from their home (if they have a 'mini tel' ') and from certain ANPE loca tions where they can use such term inals; (ii) and enterprises on the other to dis seminate their job offers at the na tional level to give them the greatest possible catchment area. By making use of this information technology, ANPE not only demon strates its own innovative capacity but also shows its willingness to increase its part of the employment market and its concern for improving its image, both towards the general public and enter prises. Furthermore, since the on-line data service will be fed with job offers from ANPE (drawing on SAGE, the computer ized operational management system of job offers \u2014 see \u00a1M No 9, and Liera, the linking between regional centres of ANPE) and its partners (Apecita for in stance, the association for the employ ment of managers, engineers and tech nicians in agriculture), the success of Ulysse will to a great extent depend on the ability of ANPE's staff to back up this new system of matching labour supply and demand. Thus, after the user chooses a job offer, he will apply by letter, enclosing his curriculum vitae, to the local employ ment agency which has registered the offer. The details of the offer and the agency in question are given after the wording of the offer as such. The em ployment officers will then short-list the candidates and submit their applica tions to the employer without delay. It is essential that applicants should be in formed rapidly of the result of the short listing and then of the employer's choice. The system came into operation on 8 September 1986. In addition to job of fers the new service is also providing general information on employment, such as job promotion schemes de cided by public authorities. Furthermore, it will be the source of statistics on job offers and the use made of the on-line data service. Netherlands: 1977 relocation aid scheme The 1977 relocation aid scheme (BVK) has been modified from the be ginning of January 1986.

Miscellaneous Denmark: Nordic cooperation in the area of labour market policy On the basis of an agreement on a common Nordic labour market there has traditionally been a very close coopera tion on labour market policy questions among the five Nordic countries: Ice land, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. This cooperation takes place within NAUT, the Nordic labour market policy committee. It comprises organized cooperation concerning labour market services/employment services, voca tional training, etc., employment meas ures and labour market research. In order to ensure the exchange of information between the national labour market administrations, an information service has been set up. This is inte grated into the information activities of the Nordic Council of Ministers. An annual catalogue is published of addresses and telephone numbers of Nordic labour market authorities. Fur thermore, 'NAUT-information' is pub lished three times a year. This publica tion provides information on national and Nordic pilot projects, research, pro posed legislative reforms and changes in the practical administration of the la bour market policy in the Nordic coun tries. Furthermore, an annual survey, the 'NAUT-catalogue' is published with in formation on current projects, activities and cooperation bodies in the labour market policy field. Since 1982 the publication and dis tribution of these labour market policy publications have been systematized in a special 'NAUT report series'. 110 ",

Banking and retail trade Introduction Growing trade union concern about the employment effect of technological change is being more and more fre quently taken up in collective 'technol ogy agreements', signed at national or sectoral level in many countries. In this respect, the main event in the first months of 1986 has been the stipulation of a new intersectoral, cooperation agreement in Denmark, covering infor mation and consultation rights as re gards the introduction of technological innovation. Denmark was one of the first countries to have, since 1981, a technol ogy agreement; over time, the unions came to judge its coverage unsatisfac tory so that the new agreement, which should correct the shortcomings of the previous one, may be of interest to the two sides of industry in other countries only now embarking upon a negotiated approach to the problem. Negotiation on the introduction of new technology is sometimes linked to negotiations on working time reorgan ization and flexibility. As a matter of fact, information technology may offer the possibility of a more flexible organiz ation of production, making compatible a better utilization of equipment and re duced and more flexible schedules of individual working time. This may also have positive effects on employment, as shown by some studies on the implica tions of planned or achieved working time reductions in different countries. These are reported in the second sec tion of this survey, together with some studies on employment, on working conditions and industrial relations, and the recent surveys of the diffusion of in formation technology. The first section deals with the positions of the two sides of industry, and gives some information on technology agreements recently signed, and on some industrial conflicts on new technology, whether eventually settled by an agreement or still open. The third section reports about recent experiences in some sectors: much is happening in all countries in the field of telecommunications services, and in the automation of banking and retail trade, while the introduction of computers in the education system continues with some new developments. I. Social groups 1. Positions of the two sides of industry In France, the Anact carried out an enquiry with the two sides of industry on their expectations concerning new tech nology agreements. 1 J. P. Jacquier, na tional secretary of CFDT, believes that, despite the difficulties of negotiating in vestment choices having uncertain con sequences, it is important to set up ne gotiating procedures enabling the par ties to take all necessary measures for a positive implementation of the technol ogy. These measures include a joint evaluation of the effects, and the prepar ation of the employees. On the employ ers' side, P. Guillen of the Union des In dustries M\u00e9tallurgiques et Mini\u00e8res, though stating the need for negotiation, particularly of training, qualifications and job changes, believes that this negotia tion should take place at enterprise, rather than at branch, level. This opinion is not shared by the Metalworkers trade unions FMT/CGT, which believe that both the workers directly concerned and the trade union should be involved in the design and introduction of new tech nologies in the enterprises.

Lespinasse independence of entrepreneurial deci sion-making is an essential requirement for the prosperity of enterprises and the national economy,' the trade unions adopted a softer position at a confer ence on technology policy held in Sep tember 1985. The attitude emerging from the conference was to reject both dema gogic optimism on new technology and the approach of considering technology as a catastrophe. It was clearly stated that union opposition is not against technology, but rather against a policy at enterprise and societal levels which only favours the interests of the employ ers. The leader of the DGB (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund) concluded that co-determination is the most important guarantee of a human development and use of new technology. He put forward the demand for an R & D policy which fo cuses on technology assessment and on the use of all alternatives for a human and social design of technology. 2 2. Trade unions On another occasion, namely the 11th Federal Conference of DGB women (Bundesfrauenkonferenz), the German union discussed telework and its consequences for women and for the employment contracts. In contrast with the moderate policy line expressed by union leaders, the majority of women put forward a hard line against telework, and launched an appeal not to use ser vices like videotex, electronic credit cards, homebanking, cable TV, and computer-assisted instruction at school. They voted for a legal ban on telework. 3 A hard line against distance work has also been expressed in Denmark by the Salaried Employees Federation, HK. At its last congress, the Federation decided to collect local, national and in ternational experiences about telework, in order to develop a trade union strategy on how to stop the spread of distance work. The reason why the Fed eration is strongly against distance work is mainly to be found in the lack of regu lation of this type of work. According to the trade union, the clauses concerning working conditions, health and safety etc. in existing laws and collective 1 Frankfurter Rundschau, 17 October 1985. 2 Frankfurter Rundschau, 13, 14, 16 September 1985. 3 Frankfurter Rundschau, 18 November 1985.

        "NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE agreements do not sufficiently protect distance workers. Until a collective agreement regulates distance work, the Federation refuses to accept even ex periments in the field. In June 1986, the Dutch Trade Union Federation FNV published an action programme 'Labour and technology', which systematizes the positions devel oped in the past few years and trans lates them into demands to the govern ment and to the employers.' The docu ment remarks that the Netherlands is not in the front line of technological de velopment, and does not use its eco nomic potential as much as it should, due among other reasons, to the lack of coordination and coherence of techno logical and innovation policies. It stresses the central importance of hu man factors in technological innovation, and puts forward a strategy of influen cing decisions beforehand, rather than regulating the negative consequences afterwards. The objectives of the action programme include: economic growth stimulated by product innovation; an ac tive government policy with the partici pation of the FNV; an increase in R&D funds to reach 2.5% of GNP; the crea tion of a system of technology assess ment in which the two sides of industry would participate; the acceleration of the process of European unity in the economic, technological and social fields, in cooperation with the social partners; a model of shorter working time, technological innovation and in creased vocational training; more active participation of the employees to renew firms' strategies and closer cooperation between -trade unions and works coun cils; and finally, positive actions in fa vour of women. In the United Kingdom, the TUC is setting up a strategy group, consisting of officials from various unions and the TUC, to coordinate the application of computer technology in the trade union movement. The group will examine the possibilities of common approaches to major computer suppliers and will dis cuss with British Telecom the concept of inter-union communication. As yet, the TUC does not have its own system but 21 of its largest affiliates have al ready installed systems and the TUC has plans to do so soon. 3. Collective agreements A new cooperation agreement con cerning the whole of the private sector has been signed in Denmark by the Confederation of Trade Unions LO and the Employers' Organization DA. The agreement replaces both the the Coop eration Agreement of 1971 and the Technology Agreement of 1981; both had been denounced by the trade un ions in December 1984, since many pro visions were considered outdated and the implementation of the information rights included in the technology agree ment was judged ineffective. The main provisions o : the new agreement are the following: (i) Cooperation committees (Samar bejdsudvalg) will be set up, at the request of one of the parties, in all companies having more than 35 em ployees (the lower limit in the previ ous agreement was 50 employees). If neither party requests that a com mittee be set up, the agreement ex plicitly suggests that at least a tech nology working group should be set up when major technological changes or reorganizations are tak ing place. The committees will be made up of an equal number of re presentatives of management and of employees, the latter elected from among the shop stewards. (ii) The main aim of the cooperation committees is to develop the daily participation of the employees. The agreement stresses the importance of applying the employees' knowl edge, competence and experience to the daily planning and organiza tion, so that work can be carried out in a rational and efficient way. (iii) The cooperation committees have the following functions: to set princi ples on working conditions, social welfare, personnel policy, education and training in new technology, the collection and use of personal data; to exchange viewpoints and discuss proposals concerning the organiza tion of production and of work and concerning major changes in the company; to assess the impact of technological change on the em ployees, on education and on work ing conditions. (iv) Management shall provide the cooperation committee with informa tion concerning the economic situa tion of the company, employment, important changes and restructuring including those linked to the use of new technology in production and administration. The information shall be given at an early stage, so that employees' ideas and proposals can be taken into account in the de cision-making process. The informa tion will not include facts that can harm the interests of the parties. (v) If a reduction in the number of jobs is foreseen as a consequence of the introduction of new technology, the company shall first try to transfer the employees concerned to a different workplace, and retrain them for the new tasks. Workers who are about to be dismissed shall be entitled to periods of leave to participate in training courses relevant to a new job and the training costs shall be paid by the company, unless they are covered by public funds. (vi) The agreement fixes the procedures in cases of grievances, and sanc tions for breach of agreement. The introduction of sanctions responds to a trade union demand, being one of the reasons why the previous agreement has been denounced. 2 Information rights are an important part of the trade union platform for the national collective agreement for the engineering sector in Italy. Being the lar gest industrial sector in the country, its ' Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging, Aktiepro- gramma 'Arbeid en Technologie', Amsterdam, FNV, June 1986. 2 Landsorganisationen/Arbejdsgiverforeningen, Samarbejdsattalen, 1986. 113 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE collective agreement, which will cover the next three years, is expected to be come a reference for trade union federa tions in other sectors. The platform was submitted to a referendum in June 1986, which is an unusual practice in the Ital ian trade union movement, and obtained the approval of 60% of the workers (whether or not unionized). Preliminary information and consultation on all inno vations concerning technology, work organization or the production mix, are demanded for all firms employing more than 150 operatives. The agreement should define a fixed term for the period of consultation, during which the union would refrain from any industrial action, while management should avoid a unila teral implementation of the innovation. A joint committee should be appointed during this period, the unions having the right to appoint experts external to the firm; the committee will examine all the implications of the innovation for man ning levels, work loads and organiza tion, and initiate negotiations on the ad justment of working hours, the use of solidarity contracts, part-time and early retirement schemes, and training re quirements. The platform also includes clauses on the reduction of working time and the introduction of flexible schedules. A framework agreement on flexibility was stipulated in Belgium by the Con seil National du Travail (National Labour Council) in April 1986. The agreement opens the way to acceptance of continu ous work when it is introduced for econ omic reasons, including investment in new technologies. It stresses the need for negotiation and for the agreement of all trade unions on all changes concern ing working time flexibility in enter prises. It applies to all sectors except commerce. The agreement innovates in relations to Royal Decree No 179, which introduced the so-called 'Hansenne ex periments' of night and weekend shifts. Like these experiments, the agreement fixes a number of conditions for intro ducing new working time patterns, namely: that they have a positive effect on employment, that the workers con cerned have an indefinite time contract and volunteer for the change. In addition to what was required under the 'Han senne experiments', however, a collec tive agreement at firm or at sectoral le vel, signed by all trade unions con cerned, is necessary before any change in working time is implemented. The German trade union economics research institute (WSI, D\u00fcsseldorf) published two reports on collective agreements containing specific clauses on the impacts of computers on the workplace and on employment. Two types of agreements were analysed: (i) the 'Tarifvertraglicher Rationalisie rungsschutz', i.e. the agreements meant to protect employees from the loss of their jobs and earnings in the case of technological rationaliza tion. These agreements usually state the priority to be given to the economic aspects of the rationaliza tion; however, they also declare the common obligation to cope with its social consequences. Conse quently, they include clauses on in formation and consultation in the case of intended technical innova tion. The most comprehensive agreement of this type is that of the printing industry: signed in 1978, it fixed the rules for the introduction of computer systems in the industry, and job and wage guarantees for the typesetters; (ii) the 'Arbeitsplatzgestaltung' are agreements on the organization of the workplace, which include rules on ergonomics, working time ar rangements, and clauses concern ing the possibility of controlling em ployees by electronic means. Most of the recent agreements contain regulations on the use of VDUs, breaks (15 minutes every second hour of work) and maximum working time at the screen (4 or 6 hours a day).' A sectoral agreement in the French dairy industry was signed in January 1986 by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale de l'In dustrie Laiti\u00e8re (Dairy Employers Feder ation) and the sectoral federations of the trade unions CFDT and CNSF (CFTC and CGT-FO have not signed). The agreement concerns working time and technological change, besides some other issues. On working time, it regu lates the forms of non-standard working time, including intermittent work, fixing an annual minimum and guaranteeing the workers concerned the same rights as those of other workers. As far as new technologies are concerned, the firms shall provide the Works Council (Comit\u00e9 d'entreprise) and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (Comit\u00e9 d'Hygi\u00e8ne, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 et Conditions de Travail) with information on the type, amount and aim of planned investment, expected productivity gains and produc tion and marketing objectives, and the expected consequences of new invest ment. The Works Council may set up an ad-hoc committee, with the participation of an external expert. The training plan of the firm shall also include measures aimed at the adaptation and retraining of the workers concerned. An agreement reached at the Italian firm FIAT concluded the long-lasting controversy on a large group of workers made redundant in December 1980 and paid since then by the 'Cassa Inte grazione' (Wage Supplement) Fund. The firm agreed, within the framework of its 1986-89 investment plan, to reabsorb into production some 5 500 laid-off workers; trade unions, on their part, agreed not to oppose innovations such as night shifts in the automated depart ments, and other measures allowing greater flexibility and productivity. It may be noted that total employment at FIAT- auto declined to 99 000 from the peak 1979 level of 164 000. An agreement was reached, in Janu ary 1986, in Denmark, to conclude the conflict initiated in summer 1985 at the United Breweries (De Forenede Bryg gerier). 2 The brewery workers accepted a cut in employment levels of 850 work ers in three years, to take place through ' I.

        "NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE natural wastage and through subsidies for the early retirement of workers hav ing more than 10 years of service. Dur ing the coming three years, the com pany will invest DKR 600 million In new production systems. In the United Kingdom, the Civil and Public Services Association (CPSA), the largest union of civil servants, signed an agreement in May 1986 on full coopera tion in the introduction of new technol ogy in return for special pay rises. Under the deal, some 150 000 clerical and data-processing workers will get rises of between 1.8% and 19.3% in return for working with computers. The long-lasting dispute in the British press, on the other hand, contin ued throughout 1986, without any satis factory solution for the over 5 000 work ers sacked at News International.' Other newspapers, however, reached nego tiated solutions to the same problem, i.e. the introduction of computer-based technology in the composing room. At News International, the trade unions continued to picket the new-technology- based Wappping plant, with occasional clashes and eruptions of violence, while talks concerning union representation at the plant were inconclusive. The final of fer of the company to conclude the dis pute, put for\u00f8ard in May, included the offer of one of the old printing sites of News International to the unions pro vided it was not used to produce exist ing newspapers; on the issue of dismis sals, the company offered some redun dancy payment to the sacked workers and a commitment not to exclude any sacked worker from the chance of being employed by the company in the future. The issue of union recognition would be reviewed next year, while News Interna tional would withdraw all outstanding le gal actions against the unions. Follow ing a ballot of their members, the trade unions rejected the offer; the dispute is at a standstill. The hard line initiated by News Inter national is however being followed by another national newspaper, namely the Daily Telegraph, which has put forward proposals for labour relations at its new printing plant similar to those that pro voked the dispute at Wapping, including a legally-binding no-strike agreement and changes in working practices. The Financial Times and the Guardian, how ever, adopted a negotiating approach to the introduction of direct inputing. The Financial Times announced a series of agreements with the print unions cover ing, among other things, direct inputting of all regular FT statistics. At the Guard ian, the unions agreed in principle to ac cept direct inputting, job reductions av eraging 20%, compulsory retirement at 65, and a pay increase of 3.5% this year. II. Studies 1. Diffusion of information technology The annual report of the Association of Italian firms operating in information technologies (Assinform), published in May 1986, outlines the main market trends in 1985. The growth, in money terms, of the market for computer hard ware and software was 25.3%, slightly lower than the corresponding figure in 1984; software grew more than hard ware, to reach one third of the total value of the computer business. Investment in computer hardware accounted for 16.7% of total investment in machinery and equipment in the national economy; the trade balance was in a deficit, al though it showed a slight improvement with respect to 1984. Compjter-related business employed, at the end of 1985, 49 500 persons, with an increase of 2 500 over the previous year. As far as specific segments of the market are concerned, some 150 000 personal computers were sold in 1985 (as against 92 000 units in 1984). Upper segments of the market, comprising 'super-per sonals' for the business sector, had higher growth than lower segments, such as home computers. In the field of big mainframe computers, large users appear to have accelerated their rate of substitution of older equipment: the av erage length of use of a computer is now estimated at less than four years. The demand for general purpose com puters is concentrated in industrial en terprises and banks (70% of the total), while the public sector accounts for only 15%. 2 The Irish National Software Centre, the IDA subsidiary founded in 1984 to help promote the software industry, published a comprehensive survey of computer usage in Ireland in December 1985. The main findings of the survey, which was based on a poll of 2 120 computer users in both private and pub lic sectors, are the following: IBM domi nates the mainframe market and holds 40% of the microcomputer market; data- processing departments of most organi zations are mainly equipped with mini and supermicro computers; traditional accounting applications were computer ized in 60% of cases studied, while larger organizations are planning inven tory control, purchasing, and personnel management systems over the next year; in office automation, financial mod elling and word processing dominate; computerized manufacturing systems, on the other hand, show a very low ratio of penetration; companies of less than 50 employees have virtually no compu terized manufacturing systems. The sur vey also suggests that the semi-State sector compares favourably with the pri vate sector in terms of installed compu ters. 3 On the supply side, a recent quar terly report from the Irish Productivity Centre shows that output in the Irish electronics industry has risen from just over 5% of total manufacturing in 1980 to over 15% in 1985, although both out put and employment had a slight de cline in 1985 due to the world slump. As a result, Irish output of computer sys tems accounted for nearly 6% of total European computer system production in 1985, up from 4% in 1982. Moreover, productivity in the electronics sector has ' See Social Europe, No 3/1986. 2 Rapporto Assinform sulla situazione dell' infor matica in Italia, Milan, May 1985. 3 'Survey of computer usage is published by NSC', Irish Times, 19 December 1985: 'MRP sys tems a top computer option for manufacturers', Technology Ireland, October 1985. 115 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE risen by 21% per annum since 1980, compared to 5% in all manufacturing in\u00ad dustry. While employment grew much less rapidly than output, the electronics industry now represents over 4% of manufacturing employment. However, the traditional weaknesses of Irish in\u00ad dustry remain the short product life cy\u00ad cles and the fact that local operations are manufacturing only with no local R&D or design input.' In the UK, the National Economic Development Office (NEDO) has pro\u00ad duced a number of reports and press statements about the diffusion and use of new technology in UK industry. In February 1986, a press release revealed that the trade deficit in IT had grown from about UKL 189 million in 1978 to UKL 1 170 million in 1984. The figures show that the UK has the largest trade gap of all OECD nations. In March, NEDO published a report on advanced handling systems \u2014 me\u00ad chanical handling hardware controlled by computer. The report warns that UK manufacturing industry is in danger of being left behind by foreign competitors in its use of advanced handling sys\u00ad tems, and suggests that more technical specialists are required at board level. 2 In another report, NEDO suggests best pracitices for the successful intro\u00ad duction of new technology, including: developing long-term training pro\u00ad grammes rather than training for imme\u00ad diate needs; developing pay structures to reward workers taking on extra re\u00ad sponsibilities and skills; discussing with workers and unions future changes in products, processes, equipment and in\u00ad vestment plans; reducing demarcations and distinctions between groups of workers. 3 In the Netherlands, a study by Heli\u00ad view shows that almost all of the 1 000 largest firms in the country have in\u00ad vested in automation. Only 1 % had made no investment by the beginning of 1986. Non-automated firms are mostly to be found in the construction industry (2%) and in transport (6%). Most auto\u00ad mation projects have been carried out in-house. Only 30% of these firms have mainframe computers, and less than 12% have more than one mainframe; 78% of the firms indicated that they had some investment in automation planned for 1986. 4 Another Heliview study examines the diffusion of automation in wholesale trade. Most firms with 10 employees or more were found to have some form of automation, while in the smaller firms 65% have not yet introduced automation at all. Most firms use in-house computer equipment, and about half use only standard software packages. 5 One study, carried out by the Neth\u00ad erlands Foundation for Psychotech\u00ad nique (Nederlandse Stichting voor Psy\u00ad chotechniek), examined the use of com\u00ad puters in personnel management divi\u00ad sions in firms having between 300 and 1 000 employees. By dividing the tasks of the personnel management divisions into three groups, namely personnel ad\u00ad ministration, recruitment, and policy de\u00ad velopment, the study found that compu\u00ad ters are mainly used in personnel ad\u00ad ministration and are almost completely unused in policy development. The procedure is in fact first to computerize simple tasks, in which input, processing and output can be determined accu\u00ad rately beforehand. In the majority of sur\u00ad veyed companies, almost the whole of the computerization projects had been carried out by the employees of the per\u00ad sonnel division itself, using microcom\u00ad puters. 6 2. Studies on employment In the UK, a study from the Institute of Manpower Studies suggests that de\u00ad mand for information technology work\u00ad ers could grow by 25 % by the end of the decade. Among other findings, the re\u00ad port discloses that only public sector employers and service companies such as computer bureaus and software con\u00ad sultancies tended to recruit school-leav\u00ad ers and retrain other workers for infor\u00ad mation technology jobs. Most employ\u00ad ers tried to recruit ready-trained workers and this was contributing to the skill shortage problem \u2014 about half the companies surveyed suffered skill shortages. 7 The problem of skill shortage, how\u00ad ever, does not concern only information technology jobs. A survey from the As\u00ad sociation of British Chambers of Com\u00ad merce found a chronic shortage of skilled workers in some parts of the country. For example, 79% of compan\u00ad ies in the Thames Valley area reported difficulty in finding skilled manual staff, 57% reported difficulty in finding office staff and 50% found it difficult to recruit other manual workers. The survey covered some 3 000 companies in manufacturing, services and distribu\u00ad tion. 8 On the other hand, workers in the in\u00ad formation technology sector are not ne\u00ad cessarily protected from unemployment. A French study carried out by the 'Agence Nationale pour l'Emploi' throws some light on this little known aspect of the labour market. 9 In September 1985, there were in France 22 479 job seekers in information technology, i.e. 9% of the working population in the sector; more\u00ad over, unemployment increased more for this occupational group ( + 30% in 1984; + 10% in 1985) than for all occupations. Keyboard staff, programmers and ma\u00ad chine operators rank high among the job seekers. The unemployed informati- clan is young (41 % are less than 25 years old), and has an above-average education level. Two types of unemploy\u00ad ment are identified by the study: as far ' Irish Productivity Centre, Business Bulletin 'Pro\u00ad ductivity-competitiveness', 1 Quarter 1986. 2 Advanced handling systems \u2014 exploiting the opportunities.

        "NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE as analysts and analyst\u00adprogrammers are concerned, it is a problem of first job search, made more difficult by the rejec\u00ad tion of geographical mobility and by the high degree of availability demanded by the employers. On the other hand, in the case of programmers and keyboard op\u00ad erators, unemployment can be defined as structural: they are older, have lost their job, and have been registered as job seekers for a long time. The changes in skill requirements and their relatively low level of training are the main reasons for their difficulty in finding a job. Two Dutch studies on different in\u00ad dustrial branches conclude that new technology affect employment levels through a change in required qualifica\u00ad tions. A study from the Department of Sociology of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam ' came to this conclusion by interviewing personnel managers in 13 firms in 8 industrial sectors. A slightly lower volume of employment is ex\u00ad pected, and the decrease will mainly oc\u00ad cur in the administrative tasks and in low\u00adgrade, unskilled jobs. The rise in the level of qualifications is thus mainly caused by the disappearance of lower functions. A similar study carried out by the Foundation for Economic Research of the University of Amsterdam (SEO) and TNO for the Ministry of Social Affairs, fo\u00ad cused on the chemical and construction industries. One of the most important qualifications demanded by the firms is the ability to adapt quickly to new pro\u00ad duction processes. Specific skills are not demanded by firms at recruitment, but can be acquired through training courses provided by the firms them\u00ad selves. A significant decrease in em\u00ad ployment can be expected in smaller firms, while larger firms have already cut the number of employees in earlier auto\u00ad mation projects. In these latter firms, in\u00ad novations are more likely to lead to new employment. 2 In Greece, a study carried out by a private consultancy firm estimated that 3 000 people are employed in the area of information technology. Of these, more than half are in manufacturing, and 16% in public administration, the other being found in education, telecommuni\u00ad cations and computer trade. 3. Work organization and working time A report prepared by D. Taddei for the French Ministry of Industrial Rede\u00ad ployment and Foreign Trade on work or\u00ad ganization and the utilization of equip\u00ad ment has recently been published. 3 The report points to the continuous decline since 1974 in equipment utilization, ac\u00ad centuated in the most recent period by the decrease in working time. There after, it proposes a better utilization of existing equipment, via a reorganization of production accompanied by a flexible and reduced pattern of working time. It draws from a number of experiments re\u00ad cently agreed on at enterprise level (20% of collective agreements at firm level in 1983 and 1984 concerned a re\u00ad organization and reduction of working time), such as individual working time schedules, different patterns of shift\u00ad work, 4 days/3 shifts working weeks, var\u00ad iable working time on an annual basis. The report concludes, on the basis of a statistical simulation, that one extra hour of machine time and a reduction of one hour in working time, with full com\u00ad pensation, would create 100 000 addi\u00ad tional jobs in the first year and 365 000 new jobs after five years. It stresses, however, that the implementation must be based on negotiation between the two sides of industry, at branch and at firm level. The first reports about the impact of flexible working time in the Federal Re\u00ad public of Germany, introduced in April 1985 on the basis of the collective agreement for the metal industry, point to favourable effects on employment. The collective agreement limited work\u00ad ing time to 38.5 hours per week, with the possibility of arranging individual work\u00ad ing time at between 37 and 40 hours per week. An inquiry carried out in 5 000 en\u00ad terprises in the metal industry, represen\u00ad ting about one fifth of all employed in the sector, found that 64% of the enter\u00ad prises have used the right to stipulate contracts with flexible individual working time. 18% of the enterprises using flexi\u00ad ble working time reported an increase in employment, whereas only 7% of the other enterprises created new jobs.\" The Belgian Stichting Technologie\u00ad Viaanderen (STV \u2014 Flemish Tech\u00ad nology Foundation) published in March 1986 a survey of social research linked to new technology and the process of social change. Some 600 research insti\u00ad tutes have been surveyed, linked both to universities, and to the two sides of industry and public administration. The survey shows that most research on economic development carried out in the Flemish part of the country concerns microeconomic studies on investment, innovation and market changes. Few studies were found at macroeconomic level, and the employment aspects are not systematically covered. On the other hand, many studies deal with work orga\u00ad nization in specific sectors using spe\u00ad cific techniques. In these studies, the is\u00ad sue of industrial relations when new technologies are introduced is exten\u00ad sively covered, as well as the relation\u00ad ship between training and the labour market. 5 An inventory of research on the so\u00ad cial aspects of office automation was carried out in the Netherlands by the In\u00ad stitute of Social and Business Psychol\u00ad ogy (ISBP) of the University of Amster\u00ad dam. 6 The survey concludes that current research in the Netherlands is mainly of ' A.

        "SOCIAL EUROPE a descriptive character, is directed to the quality of work and the decision making process, often follows the case study method, and uses many different methods of data collection. It often lacks a sound theoretical basis; moreover, the case study methodology creates pro blems of comparability. Research is mainly carried out by labour psycholo gists and sociologists, and in any case the amount of research on the social ef fects is very small, compared with the amount of investment in software and equipment. 4. Working conditions, health and safety The problem of working condition in the information technology sector is an alysed in a publication of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, which contains the proceedings of a seminar held in Ni velles in 1984.' The publication is based on the results of research and experi ences carried out at enterprise level, and deals not only with traditional er gonomie problems, but more broadly with ergonomie issues in system design and in software. The health and safety aspects of VDUs continue to be the object of stud ies and surveys. A British report claims that most of the problems associated with VDUs stem from misuse of the equipment rather than through any in herent problems with the technology. The report says that causal links be tween health problems and VDUs are rarely proven although some symptoms such as epilepsy and dermatitis do af fect some people and appear to be caused by VDUs. The report recom mends far greater attention to job de sign for workers including joint planning by management and workers on the in troduction of VDUs. 2 In the Federal Republic of Germany, the State Minister for Social Affairs in Hessen presented a study on 2 344 workplaces equipped with computer terminals. Almost 20% of these work places were found to be equipped with noisy printers and other noisy peri pheral equipment, and 80% were classi fied as badly organized from an ergo nomie point of view. The producers of technical equipment and office furniture, however, stated that many users nullify the ergonomie design, by locating and arranging the equipment inefficiently. 3 5. Industrial relations The automation policy of the Dutch trade unions is the subject of a study of the first graduate engineer in Technol ogy and Society (Tema) of the TH Eind hoven.\" The main conclusion of the study is that trade unions are rather ac tive in developing policy in the field of automation, but that their coherent pol icy at central level is not reproduced consistently at branch and enterprise level, nor in collective bargaining. Thus actual policy options at local level may differ from the central policy, and be tween one region and another. Of the three union organizations, the policy of the FNV (Federal Trade Union) and of the CNV (Christian Trade Union), are ba sically in agreement with each other at central level; for the FNV, the aims are more efficient procedures and participa tion in the works councils, and a greater right of initiative for the works councils themselves; the CNV is more radical and demands the right for the works councils to give their agreement on all automation projects. On the other hand, the MHP (Trade union for higher-grade personnel) rejects the right of employ ees to participate in the automation pol icy of the companies. The study con cludes that a more coordinated policy at all levels and among all organizations is necessary in order to turn information technology into a positive challenge for the trade union movement. At sectoral level, a German study which compares industrial relations' is sues on the introduction of automated equipment in the automobile industry in three countries (Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, UK) concludes that the level of conflict in regard to new technol ogies is rather low. In spite of their differ ent political stands, the shop stewards have never adopted an inflexible stance against technical change, nor have they demanded general technology agree ments, or delayed the technological change for the sake of job protection. In only one German case was the intro duction of robots opposed by the shop steward, due to the lack of timely infor mation. 5 In the Netherlands, the Foundation Big Brother (Stichting Grote Broer) pub lished a book Automation on a human scale, describing 10 successful cases of automation processes in the private sector. In all cases described the end- users had participated in the project and the personnel representatives had influ enced firms' policy. Although jobs had been lost in the process, the experi ences are considered successful in so far as work organization has improved and the participation of employees has increased. 6 III. Experiences in specific sectors 1. Telecommunication services The spread of Minitel in France has induced a differentiated marketing strategy: telephone subscribers located in certain areas (called 'Emeraudes') re ceive it in replacement of the telephone directory; those in other areas (called 'Rubis') have to hire it. The former are ' R. Patesson (ed.), Ergonomie et conditions de travail en informatique, Brussels, Editions de l'U.L.B., 1986. 2 C.

        "NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE rapidly increasing, the number of Mini tels in use being expected to reach 2.5-3 million by the end of 1986. Minitel is also used to circulate infor mation on job vacancies in the firm Saint-Gobain-Pont-\u00e0-Mousson. The firm plans to eliminate some 16 000 jobs in the next four years but, at the same time, cannot fill more than 5% of vacant posts though internal mobility. By using Mini tel, the personnel department of each establishment circulates information on its vacancies to the other establish ments of the group. Vacant posts are re served for internal transfers for a period ranging from a month in the case of workers to three months in the case of executives. The firm expects to be able thus to fill 40% of the vacancies through internal mobility. In March 1986, the videotex service of the Belgian RTT was inaugurated. It is a Prestel-type videotex, accessible to telephone subscribers through a termi nal or an interfaced microcomputer. In the first stage, this new service is meant to be only for professional users. In Italy, the Itapac network (a special ized public network for data trans mission based on package-switching) will be extended by the end of 1986 to all large towns in the country. Data files already available for consultation in clude reports on 700 business areas, the employers' association Confindus- tria's information system (available to its members), and balance sheet data on 500 000 Italian firms. Istat, the Central Statistical Office, is setting up terminals available for the general public to re quest current statistical information. The Itapac network may be interconnected with similar networks in other European countries and in the USA. Ireland's packet-switching network \u2014 Eirpac \u2014 inaugurated in 1985, was quickly taken up by large-scale users, such as multinationals, banks, universi ties and computer companies, but Te lecom Eireann is trying to expand the number of customers in order better to exploit Eirpac's capacity. It launched an international electronic mail service known as Eirmail, which gives access to 150 000 other users in 12 countries. In- Copyright REA/C. Lespinasse tended for mass consumption, it will open the way to many proposed new services which will include specialized credit card transactions, videotext access, teletext, and high speed fac simile services. The first Greek public network, called DATA, will be installed by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organiza tion in 1987. It will support a series of services, such as videotex and fac simile. 119 ",
        "SOCIAL EUROPE In Germany a broader debate is tak ing place on telecommunications ser vices, following the recommendation from a board of counsellors that postal and telecommunications services should be separated and competition should be introduced in the telecommu nications market. At present, the two services are organized together as a monopolistic public enterprise, employ ing 461 000 persons. This allows funds to be transferred from the profitable tele phone service to the non-profitable postal service. Those who support the separation of the two services argue in favour of the reinvestment of profits in the telecommunications sector; more over, a number of economic groups are interested in entering the telecommuni cations market. The opponents insist on the public use and interdependence of the two services. Whatever the institu tional pattern, the rationalization of the postal services, and the increased use of computers may have considerable ef fects on employment. The trade union (Deutsche Postgewerkschaft) calculated that some 30 000 jobs will be lost in the next few years, due to the rationalization of delivery services, the introduction of desk terminals, the automation of the postal bank services, and the automa tion of telephone information.' Education and training After the programme 'Informatics for everybody', the French authorities have launched a new programme called 'Telematics for everybody'. More limited than the former, it concerns some 700 schools, equipped to different degrees of sophistication. Some schools will only be able to access external net works, by using their school computer; others will be able to produce informa tion and documents. Moreover, telemat ics is going to be used in the adminis tration of the schools: information on the school and the pupils will be accessible through telematics to the other schools and to the families. In the vocational training field, the Neuilly centre of the association for vo cational training of adults (AFPA) has started a course to train technicians in office automation and informatics for management, specifically addressed to small and medium-sized enterprises.

        "NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE will attend courses both on the applica tions of information technology, and on the specific problems of computeriza tion of small enterprises. At the end of the five-month course, the trainees are expected to be suitable for employment in small software and consulting firms, or in small manufacturing firms. The introduction of computers in schools continues in all countries, but some problems are emerging. As an ex ample, in Denmark, where decisions about computer purchasing are decen tralized, between 10 000 and 20 000 computers have been bought, represen ting at least 20 different types running on not less than five different operating systems, with all the related problems of lack of compatibility.' There are also some other prob lems, which make the introduction of computers in education less successful than generally expected. A study of the Institute for Research on School Devel opment of the University of Dortmund (FRG) found that the students who own a programmable computer for educa tional purposes perform less well than the other students. They also watch much more TV. Computer freaks sit at the screen up to eight hours per day, half of the time at the computer, the other half watching TV. 2 3. Banking and retail trade The first on-line shared automatic teller machine network for British build ing societies went live in February 1986. The Anglia, Bradford & Bingley and Leeds Permanent were the first three to join and four others will join the network over the next few months. Still in the UK, the first phase of Bar- claycard's electronic shopping system, designed to cut costs and deter fraud, got underway in March 1986. The scheme, called Darts \u2014 data capture and authorization retail transaction ser vice \u2014 is in operation in a shopping complex in North London; it eliminates much of the paperwork usually involved in the credit card business and eventu ally will accept other credit cards in ad dition to Barclaycard. The National Westminster Eftpos scheme, based on Texaco service sta tions, also got off the ground in the same period. The scheme accepts pay ment by Access via a personal identifi cation number, but will also take other credit cards provided a voucher is signed in the normal way. In Denmark, the Dan card, i.e. the national payment and credit card sys tem, introduced in 1983 with the expec tation of a wide diffusion, is only slowly taking off due to a number of problems. It first raised many criticisms on the ground of a possible threat to civil liber ties, until the Government passed some regulatory measures in 1984; it was then rejected by the retail sector, which did not want to bear the costs of the system. An agreement has only recently been signed by the Banks' Payment and Credit Card Limited Company (Penge- instituternes Koebe og Kreditkort Aktie selskab, PKK), which manages the sys tem, a major supermarket chain and the professional organization of grocers; ac cording to the agreement, the shops will have to finance the purchase of POS- terminals, but neither the shop nor the cardholder will be charged for each transaction. On the contrary, retailers will receive until 1989 a special market ing subsidy to promote the system. Two big Irish banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, launched a pilot scheme based on a new type of automated teller machine located inside retail outlets and which issues vouchers for presentation to a cashier instead of supplying banknotes. This system Is be lieved to be much cheaper than conven tional ATMs; the latter require at least 1 500 transactions per week per ma chine to break even. The pilot study will evaluate the business implications and customer response to this payment fa cility. The Belgian credit institutions which run the two systems of ATMs and elec- tronic-point-of-sales cards, 'Bancontact' and 'Mister cash', have signed an agree ment to make the two systems compati ble, so that cardholders will be able to use both. Compatibility will first concern points of sale at petrol stations and supermarkets; automatic tellers will be made compatible in the first half of 1987. Home banking is being introduced on an experimental basis in the Nether lands. The Postbank started in February 1986 an experiment called 'Girotel', whereby small businesses and individu als can contact the Postbank and give orders for transactions through their computer from the office or from home. 1 000 bank account holders participate in the experiment, but people interested were much more numerous: only one out of ten applicants was accepted. Other banks are trying different elec tronic services. Since the beginning of 1986 AMRO Bank and NMB have intro duced a system whereby customers can use a floppy disc to instruct the bank for payment transactions. Clients use a special software package, and the disc is then delivered to the bank for au tomatic clearing. The service is intended for medium and small-sized businesses and organizations. These developments induce banks to increase their training efforts: AMRO Bank plans to train all its employees, i. e. some 23 000 people, in the coming years, and other banks are starting, or planning, similar in-house training programmes. As far as the effects on employment are concerned, the German trade union in the banking sector (DAG) states that one bankomat replaces 4 employees; overall, 10% of the jobs will be lost by 1993. 3 The employers, on the contrary, point out that in the past few years em ployment increased by about 3% p.a. For the near future they forecast an an nual growth of over 1 %. The increase in productivity had no negative effect on employment, in their opinion, because banking activities expanded more rap idly. Moreover, they point out that both qualifications and wages have risen alongside with productivity. 4 1 Weekendavisen, 14-20 March 1986. 2 Frankfurter Rundschau, 14 November 1985. 3 Frankfurter Rundschau, 3 September 1985. 4 Raban Freiherr Von Spiegel, 'Personalpolitik in Banken unter dem Einflu\u00df der neuen Technolo gien', Die Bank, 1/1986. 121 ",
