        "2 Statistical Requirements Compendium - 2010 edition Foreword to the 2010 edition The Statistical Requirements Compendium is a well-established reference document for the acquis communautaire in statistics. The Compendium is a tool for producers of official statistics, which summarises the key reference information for European statistical production. Eurostat updates this Compendium every year to take into account new legislation and other developments relevant for European official statistics. In April 2009, the new Statistical Law (Regulation no 223/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics) entered into force. As an immediate follow-up the Commission adopted in August 2009 the Communication on the production method of EU statistics: a vision for the next decade (COM(2009) 404 final). The Communication stipulates that Eurostat proposals for future EU statistical legislation would be formulated in such a way as to enable and to promote the emerging architecture of interdependent production systems drawing upon multiple sources. The new generation of statistical legal acts would deal with broader areas of statistics than had been the practice up to that time, emphasizing the use of multiple data sources, innovative data collection methods, the information available at the regional level and cross-domain concepts. Most of the technical aspects of the legislation would not be part of the basic legal framework of a particular statistical area, but would be laid down in implementing legislation. The structure of the 2010 edition of the Compendium generally follows the annual Statistical Work Programme of the Commission for 2010 which was adopted on the basis of the multiannual Community Statistical Programme 2008 to 2012 (Decision no 1578/2007 of the European Parliament and the Council of 11 December 2007). For each theme and module that belongs to a specific domain and that is relevant for European official statistics producers, the 2010 edition of the Compendium provides: \u2022 a description of the statistical theme, \u2022 the relevant legal acts with the Official Journal reference and other documents relevant for the compilation of statistics such as agreements between Eurostat and Member States, \u2022 the data requirements \u2013 i.e. the data sets to be provided by European statistics producers to Eurostat, \u2022 methodological information, \u2022 information on international cooperation. The electronic version of this Compendium can be downloaded from the Eurostat website at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu. For obtaining a paper copy or in order to suggest improvements of this publication please write to ESTAT-D1-REQUESTS@ec.europa.eu. This publication was produced by Eurostat unit D-1 \u2013 Statistical cooperation with European and Mediterranean countries, with the assistance of Mr. Andrei Sandoiu, in close cooperation with all subject matter units of Eurostat. The help and support of the subject matter units was indispensable for the compilation of this publication. Anton Steurer Acting Head of Unit Eurostat D-1 June 2010 ",

        "7 Statistical Requirements Compendium - 2010 edition Introduction The Statistical Requirements Compendium is a tool for producers of official statistics. The Compendium summarises the key reference information for European statistical production. The presentations of the statistical themes and modules in the Compendium are made from the perspective of a statistics provider in a country. This means that in general only those modules are included where there is a legal basis that influences the way statistics are produced in countries implementing the European Statistical System or where there are obligations to provide data to Eurostat. The presentation is organised according to domains divided into themes and modules. The structure generally follows the Statistical Work Programme of the Commission for 2010. Each theme and module, that is relevant for European official statistics providers, is presented as follows. Theme N.NN XXXX (Number and title of the theme) Description This section describes the content of the theme. Module N.NN.NN XXXX (Number and title of the module, for each module coming under a given theme) 1. Module description This section describes the content of the module. 2. Legal Basis This section includes the legal acts, formal agreements and other basic reference documents relevant for the statistical work coming under a given module. Legal acts: This sub-section contains all legislation published in the Official Journal that is relevant for the production of the statistics. These are Directives, Regulations, Decisions, Resolutions or Recommendations approved by the European Council and Parliament or by the European Commission. Agreements: This sub-section contains all kinds of agreements, i.e. agreements with Member States reached within Eurostat Working Groups, Gentlemen's agreements etc. Other basis: This sub-section contains all other documents that are considered as relevant for the production of the statistics in the particular area. The sub-section also includes legislation under preparation such as Draft Council Regulations or Proposals for a Regulation / Directive. It can also be Communications from the Commission to the European Parliament and Council, EU Action plans, Programs, Strategies and Memoranda. This sub-section may also include other ",
        "8 Statistical Requirements Compendium - 2010 edition relevant documents such as documents and minutes of Eurostat Working Groups, Manuals, Reference Guides, Handbooks or Web pages. 3. Data requirements This section lists all datasets that are to be provided from National Statistical Institutes to Eurostat via eDAMIS, the Eurostat single entry point for data. Registered users can access eDAMIS at https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/edamis Each data set description includes the code and the name of the data set. 'Timeliness' usually means the number of days between the end of the reference period and the deadline for the transmission of the data to Eurostat. 'Periodicity' expresses the length of the period for which the data is collected (e.g. 2 \u2013 every two years, A \u2013 annually, B \u2013 biannually, S \u2013 semiannually, Q \u2013 quarterly, M \u2013 monthly). 4. Methodology This section presents documents or links to interest groups that are useful for the production of the statistics for the particular module. Documents can be minutes of Working Groups, White Papers, statistical methodological manuals, etc. In general, this section contains material that is mainly for information whereas material presented under 'other basis' in the section 2.'Legal Basis' implies a degree of obligation. However, there is not always a clear borderline so that e.g. methodological manuals may be found in either this section or in section 2. 5. International Cooperation This section lists international organisations that in cooperation with Eurostat produce statistics for the particular module. ",

        "DOMAIN 1 Demographic and social statistics 21 Statistical Requirements Compendium - 2010 edition Theme 1.02 Labour market Description Labour market statistics provide short-term and structural descriptions of the labour market in monetary and non-monetary terms as well as in a time-use context. The focus is on both the supply (actual participation in its various dimensions, labour reserve, inactive persons) and demand side (job vacancies). The statistics cover the European Union, the euro area, Member States, candidate countries and EEA/EFTA countries. They support the conduct and coordination of policies in the fields of employment and economic and monetary policy. They also help the Commission to define, implement and monitor labour market policies within the revised Lisbon strategy and the European employment strategy. For the medium term, the focus is on improving labour statistics in terms of coverage and quality by (i) adapting and strengthening the Labour Force Survey (LFS) process so that it can better meet user demands for pertinent and timely data; (ii) improving the coherence and integration of employment statistics; (iii) further developing the structural indicators and the principal European economic indicators (PEEI) for the labour market; (iv) fully implementing job vacancy statistics; and (v) fine-tuning the integrated system of earnings and labour cost statistics.

Module Description The module covers the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS), job vacancy statistics and statistics on industrial disputes (strikes). The LFS, for which Regulation 577/98 is the basic legal act, provides quarterly and annual information on a wide range of labour market characteristics and socio-demographic variables of individuals and households. Based on quarterly/annual micro-datasets detailed tables, aggregate information, targeted indicators and time series are produced, analysed and disseminated. Tailor-made extractions using the micro-datasets are made and provided to users. Annual-ad hoc modules are developed; the results are processed and published. Based on the LFS monthly unemployment rates are estimated and released as headline indicators. Conceptual work and quality-related projects are undertaken across the entire domain. Job vacancy statistics are collected, processed and published under gentlemen's agreement. Work on conceptual and data collection issues is ongoing. Launching first data transmissions under regulation 453/2008 is planned in 2010 for reference quarter 2010Q1. Data on strikes are published annually on the basis of a voluntary data collection in the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 2.

Module Description The objective of this domain is to provide comparable data, statistics and indicators on education for the EU-27, the candidate countries, EEA countries, Switzerland, Albania, Japan as well as other countries available. The main data source is the set of joint UOE (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, OECD and Eurostat) questionnaires on education systems including some Eurostat-specific tables. The statistics refer to public and private, full-time and part-time education in school and university systems as defined in the UOE manuals. The international standard classification of education (ISCED), 1997 version, is used for defining education levels and fields. The statistics cover enrolments, entrants, graduates, personnel, language learning and expenditure. Regional data are also available.

Module Description This module covers vocational training and outcomes of education statistics. The EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) provides results on the levels of participation in lifelong learning activities (age group 15+). The production of education variables in the EU-LFS is covered by the Regulation (EC) No 1372/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community. The Adult Education Survey (AES) provides data on the structure of participation of adults in lifelong learning activities (age group 25-64 years old). It covers in particular the patterns of participation in formal and non-formal education and training, reasons for participation, obstacles to participation, costs of participation as well as types and intensity of participation. The 2005-2008 Adult Education Survey was a pilot exercise at EU level. The results are available for most EU countries (EU27 except Ireland and Luxembourg) as well as Croatia, Turkey and Norway. The next survey is covered by the Regulation (EC) No 452/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 concerning the production and development of statistics on education and lifelong learning (domain 2). A Commission Regulation (to be published by the end of 2010) defines the observation period and the deadline for the transmission of the results and provides information on the description of the variables as well as on the sampling, precision and quality requirements. The objective of the continuing vocational training survey (CVTS) is to provide comparable statistical results on training and non-training enterprises, the supply of and the demand for vocational skills, the need for CVT and the forms, content and volume of CVT, the use of enterprises\u2019 own training resources and of external providers, cost of CVT courses as well as initial vocational training from 2005 (e.g. apprenticeships). The survey covers enterprises with 10 and more employees in Sections C to K and O of the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE Rev. 1). Three rounds of surveys have been carried out with reference years 1993, 1999 and 2005.The production of CVTS data is covered by the Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council on statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises. A Commission Regulation (to be published by the end of 2010) amends Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 as regards the list of variables as well as the precision requirements (NACE Rev 2 and additional requirements for the representativeness of the results in large countries). Educational outcomes (educational attainment) is provided by household surveys carried out in Member States, notably by the EU Labour Force Survey but also by the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The objective is to provide comparable statistical results on the educational attainment of populations combined with other socio-economic variables. Ad hoc modules are attached to the EU-LFS on a yearly basis since 1999. Three modules concern education matters: Transition from school to working life (2000), Lifelong learning (2003) and Entry of young people into the labour market (2009). ",

The definition of cultural domain prepared by the EC LEG-Culture and adopted by the SPC in 1999 needs updating, also in connection with the new proposed framework for cultural statistics in preparation by Unesco. A methodology identifying cultural employment by crossing economic sectors and occupations should be revised, taking into account recent revisions of NACE and ISCO. The methodological work concerning cultural participation continues, taking into consideration new cultural practices related to the use of ICT. More methodological work has to be done in the domain of expenditure on culture, mainly public expenditure and financing of culture where specific administrative data collection could be envisaged. Economic statistics on cultural industries are available from the EU-Structural Business Statistics database but the coverage of this sector is very limited; new data sources for this theme should be explored. Statistics on cultural provision need more harmonisation. Cooperation with the Unesco Institute for Statistics is very important in this area. The Council of Europe, the OECD and many international organisations in the cultural domain are also interested in collaboration. ",

Module Description The objective of culture statistics is to provide harmonised data on culture and creativity, in the context of its contribution to employment, growth and intercultural dialogue in Europe. With the renewed concern for statistics on culture at the Council level in the context of the Lisbon strategy (Council Resolution from 16.11.2007), the work in this domain was re-launched in Eurostat in mi-2008. In September 2009 the ESSnet-culture has started its activities. Its work is based on better use of existing data sources (assessing the comparability of these statistics) and can provide proposals for new/better data collections in the fields of cultural industries, cultural expenditure and cultural participation.

Module Description The objective of this module is to produce harmonised data on income, social inclusion and living conditions at EU level. The data are the main source for the compilation of comparable indicators on social cohesion used for policy monitoring at EU level in the context of the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion. The data is based on EU-SILC, an annual survey covering about 140,000 households and collecting cross-sectional and longitudinal data on income, level of education, labour market, family situation and other living conditions. SILC was launched in 2003 by a group of voluntary countries and then gradually extended. As from 2007 onwards the EU-SILC data collection has taken place in 31 countries (EU Member States, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey). It is based on Regulation No. 1177/2003 of the Council and European Parliament and on implementing Commission regulations. An additional Commission regulation on an annual ad- hoc module is developed each year. Aggregated tables and indicators are available on the Eurostat website (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/living_conditions_and_social_protection/dat a).

Module Description Food consumption statistics will serve two main purposes: to use it in the context of risk assessments for 'food safety' and to monitor policies, actions and programmes on 'health and nutrition'. The overall aim is to develop a methodology for statistical data on food consumption in order to assist in the evaluation, monitoring and orientation of health and food safety policies of the EU. A first list of indicators for priority substances and priority foods and nutrients has been established. The Household Budget Survey has been identified as a possible source for calculating food consumption indicators related to health and nutrition. Following a first transmission of data on food quantities collected by Member States from their national 2005 Household Budget Surveys, Eurostat is using these data to calculate a set of indicators to monitor health and nutrition policy. 2.

In the field of social reporting, Eurostat is and will remain an active co-author together with DG EMPL of the report \u2018The social situation in the European Union\u2019. In addition to a holistic view, this report has a special focus from one edition to another. Eurostat also produces the statistical pocketbook \u2018Living conditions in Europe\u2019. The aim of gender statistics is to describe women\u2019s and men\u2019s different roles in society. A gender perspective should be integrated in all statistics on individuals. The strategy is to increase data collection by sex, to develop gender statistics, and to increase the effort to have a more extensive presentation of gender statistics. The political interest in young people is growing. With the Commission's new Youth Stratey (2010-2018) adopted in April 2009, there is a strong focus on evidence-based youth policy. In this context, the need for solid statistical and sociological data and analysis becomes obvious. At EU level harmonized statistical data are numerous but should be better exploited. Eurostat will therefore make the existing data sources on youth more accessible and user-friendly on its online database. The EPSS project is a three-year rolling programme of all social surveys. It aims to rationalise the existing household surveys and to reinforce the general social statistical infrastructure so that Eurostat is in a better position to answer new Commission demands. The aim of harmonising the core social variables is to implement in each EU social survey a limited set of common variables in order to allow more cross-sources analysis. The EPSS and the core social variables are cornerstones of a long-term re-engineering of social statistics. ",

The data are used by the Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB), as well as by national governments, social partners, financial markets, economic analysts and other institutional and private users. Annual national accounts also constitute the basis for many structural indicators required by the European Council.

The ESA revision work will ensure that the new ESA will continue to be the appropriate methodological reference for the production of high quality national accounts data required for major EU policies (e.g. own resources, excessive deficit procedure, structural funds, etc.) and for economic analysis. The work covers the elaboration of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules intended to be used for compiling accounts and tables on a comparable basis as well as a programme for transmitting, for Community purposes and on precise dates, these accounts and tables. Work on some specific methodological and implementation aspects (e.g. improved price and volume measures and the development of some supplementary tables and satellite accounts frameworks) will also be a key task. 2.

In cooperation with DG BUDG, Eurostat carries out a detailed verification of the figures and the calculations. Gross National Income (GNI, formerly Gross National Product \u2014 GNP) constitutes the basis for allocating the GNI-based \u2018fourth\u2019 resource.

Three important aims are to improve HICP quality in the medium term through the adoption of further minimum standards, to develop house price indices for housing and owner- occupied housing and to make available detailed price statistics for single market monitoring, the food prices monitoring tool and for assessing consumer outcomes (the Consumer Market Scoreboard). Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) are necessary for the allocation of structural funds by the Commission (DG REGIO). The PPP process is laid down in European Parliament and Council Regulation 1445/2007 (the PPP Regulation). The strategy is to enhance data quality by improving the data handling and production process of PPPs (in particular with the PPP database and related tools) as well as Member States\u2019 sources and methods.

        "DOMAIN 2 Macroeconomic statistics 114 Statistical Requirements Compendium - 2010 edition Theme 2.07 Trade in goods Description Statistics on international trade in goods comprise data on trade between the Member States (Intrastat) and data on trade with non-member countries (Extrastat). The statistical information is of essential importance for European economic and trade policies as well as for the analysis of market developments of individual commodities. The statistics contain detailed data broken down by reporting Member States and partner countries, by commodities according to the Combined Nomenclature and SITC, by mode of transport and by type of preference in the case of imports. The development work concentrates on making available to users harmonised statistics which meet the requirements in terms of quality and timeliness and which are relevant and matched to users\u2019 needs, including new needs arising in the framework of EMU and the changing international environment. The concepts and methods are adapted so as to integrate statistics on international trade in goods into the general statistical system at Community and international level and to respond to changes in the administrative environment. At the same time methodological principles and tools based on the latest technological advances are developed with the objective of minimising the reporting burden on businesses and enhancing data quality. The data are collected, processed and disseminated in accordance with the provisions laid down in Community legislation (Extrastat and Intrastat Regulations). The Modernised Customs Code, which shall apply at the latest on 24 June 2013, will allow lodging customs declarations (and then providing statistical data) through centralised clearance or self- assessment by authorised traders. The implementation of the new Extrastat Regulation will therefore imply appropriate mechanisms for the exchange of information between economic operators, customs and statistical authorities in such cases.

Other relevant policies are enlargement, the Commission\u2019s bilateral relations, the management of regional agreements and the completion of the internal market. The following statistics are of crucial importance here: (i) international trade in services; (ii) foreign direct investment; (iii) foreign affiliates (FATS); (iv) balance of payments (BoP) of the EU; (v) BoP of candidate countries; (vi) BoP of the European institutions; and (vii) remittances. Key customers are the ECB and Commission departments dealing with trade policy, economic monitoring and external relations. Member States\u2019 BoP compilers are also customers for the EU institutions\u2019 BoP. Ensuring the consistency of the BoP with national accounts and foreign trade is crucial. Harmonised implementation of new international standards in the EU will be coordinated and monitored. Work will be pursued in the years ahead \u2014 through the implementation of the BoP Regulation \u2014 to ensure that Member States keep on providing good-quality data to Eurostat and the ECB. It is also strategically important to implement the new Regulation on foreign affiliates statistics.

A White Paper and its mid-term review (\u2018Keep Europe moving \u2014 Sustainable mobility for our continent\u2019) set out the EU action programme on transport policy. Community transport statistics should constitute a comprehensive transport information system, including above all data on flows of vehicles, passengers and goods, but also on infrastructure, equipment, mobility, safety, enterprises, investments and employment. A key objective will be to measure the contribution of each mode of transport, used alone and in combination with others, to the global figures. It will be necessary to consolidate structural, sustainable development, modal split, energy and environmental impact indicators, and to develop indicators of quality and performance for all modes of transport. The increasing trends to optimise the high cost and investment in transport infrastructure will create more needs for statistics on them. Transport is also an important part of Community regional and environmental policies. The former will increase demands for spatially broken-down data on transport networks and flows. Taking into account the growing awareness of climate change and the significant impact of transport on this, more and more work will be required to measure the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, as well as the evolution of passenger behaviour regarding transport, particularly in European cities. The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) is very important for competitiveness and growth. Transport statistics should provide specific information on the development of the TEN-T infrastructure and on the services it provides. ",

Module Description The objectives of this module are to provide statistics on passenger mobility and road traffic. For the former, an inventory of the existing non-harmonised national surveys has been established and is regularly updated. For the latter, a voluntary regular data collection on Vehicle-Km performed on the national territories is in development. 2. Legal Basis Other basis: A harmonised EU survey in long-distance mobility (Dateline project) was carried out in 2001- 2002, within the 5th R&D Framework Programme. See at: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/dateline/ Eurostat has a project aimed to collect and update a non-harmonised database with the latest available information and results from the national travel surveys. This also includes a methodological analysis of the results of such surveys and the dissemination of the main existing results on passenger mobility in a Statistics in focus. The official data providers are the CNA (Competent National Authorities) like statistical offices or transport ministries. In 2008, Eurostat has launched a voluntary exercise for the collection of Vehicle-Kilometre (V- Km) data on road traffic under a common methodological framework. This would allow building a common framework to produce road V-Km every year, particularly for car transport, based essentially on existing sources and evolving towards a regular and harmonised data collection system. 3. Data Requirements Four tables have been designed for the provision of V-Km data with different breakdown: by type of vehicle, by type of road, by type and age of vehicle and by gender and age of driver.

It comprises a wide variety of products or services and destinations and many different stakeholders are involved with highly decentralised areas of competence, often at regional and local levels. Currently, statistics are collected on the supply of and demand for tourist accommodation, as well as on participation in tourism and tourism behaviour of EU residents. The legal basis for this data collection (Council Directive 95/57, the related Commission Decisions of 9 December 1998 and 10 December 2004, and Council Directive 2006/110) are being updated in order to ensure the quality of the data collection in terms of relevance, comparability, completeness and freshness of the data. A renewed legal act is scheduled to be adopted in 2010. Further, statistics on tourism employment and on indicators related to sustainable and competitive tourism are compiled using existing statistics. ",

Module Description The objective is to compile and publish harmonised and high-quality statistical information on tourism in Europe. Since 1995, the legal basis for tourism statistics is Council Directive 95/57/EC. The legal basis is under revision (with a Regulation expected to enter into force in 2011 or 2012). The current system of tourism statistics consists of two main elements. On the one hand the supply side statistics, giving information on capacity and occupancy of tourist accommodation establishments. On the other hand the demand side, giving information on tourism participation and tourism trips made by residents of the European Union. While the first is closer to the concept of business statistics, the latter has more affinity with social statistics. Both components together depict the state of affairs of tourism in Europe as well as tourism by Europeans. 2.

The theme also covers the definition of appropriate statistical units for observation of the production system in the Community (local units, enterprises and enterprise groups). The Business Registers Regulation (EC) No 177/2008 requires the exchange of individual data on multinational enterprise groups. This is needed as basic infrastructure for the establishment of a EuroGroups Register (EGR) of MNEs and their constituent units. The EGR is developed in phases. A pilot project for the EGR was carried out in 2006. In 2009 the first EGR production cycle started with coverage of 5 000 MNEs. An extension of the coverage to 10 000 MNEs is planned for 2011 and full implementation should be achieved by 2013. Measures used to achieve the objectives include implementing legal acts and the maintenance of a recommendations manual giving guidance for the implementation of BRs. ",

Crop production statistics cover, on the basis of existing legislation and the one adopted and to be published in 2009, agricultural land use, wine supply balance sheets and data on production for (i) cereals, (ii) other main field crops and (iii) fruits and vegetables. Supply balance sheets for other crop products and data on flowers and ornamental plants are collected under gentlemen\u2019s agreements. In addition, crop statistics also cover structural data on orchards and vineyards regulated under specific EU legislation. Animal production statistics cover, on the basis of existing legislation, livestock surveys as well as meat, milk and poultry statistics. Both crop and animal production statistics not only play a key role in the design, implementation and monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) but also contribute to ensuring food and feed safety/security in the European Union. These data are then used by the European and national authorities, third countries\u2019 administrations, stakeholders, scientists and the general public for policy making, risk management, market analysis, production forecasts, research, information, etc. Special attention is devoted to statistical relevance, timeliness and accessibility of data with a view to satisfying current and potential needs of users. Besides this, a considerable effort is undertaken to ensure accuracy through quality checks aimed at detecting and eventually correcting observed errors in the data. To make sure data is of high quality, appropriate validation procedures, placed between the collection and the dissemination of data, are continuously being implemented and reviewed. Several validation tools (e.g. AGRIS, eDAMIS/Webforms, Building Blocks) play an increasingly important role in the system of data processing and need to be further integrated and developed in close cooperation with other Eurostat departments.

Module Description The objective is to collect, process and disseminate regional, national and EU data on crop production and land use. Crop products statistics cover the production data for cereals, other field crops, fruits and vegetables and the supply balance sheets for a large number of crop products. They also include two specialised surveys, one on vineyards with a basic survey every ten years and an annual intermediate survey as well a fruit trees plantation survey every five years. Except for the specialised surveys mentioned, data is reported annually for all products. The revision of existing community legislation and gentlemen agreements will simplify and consolidate the scope of crop statistics (i.e. fruit, vegetables and early estimates will be included in the legislation, needs of the specialised surveys on vineyard and orchard will be reconsidered). Special attention is devoted to the collection, validation and dissemination of the data, to analysis of the used methods and to the update of the metadata information. 2.

This objective will be met by harmonising and integrating national land cover/use statistics and \u2014 at European level \u2014 by using the LUCAS data and other European-level data sources. The objective is to set up area frame surveys for the provision of (i) coherent and harmonised statistics on land use and land cover, (ii) information on agriculture, (iii) information on the environment, landscapes and sustainable development, (iv) ground evidence for calibration of satellite images, (v) a register of points for specific surveys (such as soil, biodiversity etc.) and (vi) for the core European in-situ data collection network.

Besides this, a considerable effort is undertaken to ensure accuracy through quality checks aimed at detecting and eventually correcting observed errors in the data. To make sure data are of high quality, appropriate validation procedures, placed between the collection and the dissemination of data, are continuously being implemented and reviewed. Several validation tools (e.g. AGRIS, eDAMIS/Webforms, Building Blocks) play an increasingly important role in the system of data processing and need to be further integrated and developed in close cooperation with the countries and other Eurostat departments.

The Commission departments, in close cooperation with Member States, have defined a list of indicators which address the three main objectives for rural development policy: improve the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry; improve the environment; enhance the quality of life in rural areas and promote diversification of economic activities through measures targeting the farm sector and other rural actors. Eurostat undertakes the compilation of the statistics used for these indicators, based entirely on data already available either in the Member States or within Eurostat. In addition, Eurostat works with other Commission departments and Member States to develop new indicators of rural development within the EU. DG REGIO published its Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion on 6 October 2008 (COM(2008) 616 final), from which it is clear that additional data will be required at NUTS3 level. Close cooperation with the unit responsible for regional statistics has therefore to be ensured. Further synergies between the rural development and territorial cohesion activities have to be identified to maximise the use of available data. In 2007, the Commission put forward the main elements of a new European integrated maritime policy, including its founding principles and main objectives, the required governance framework and appropriate tools for integrated policy-making (COM(2007) 575). One of the key actions set out in the proposal is the improvement of socio-economic data for maritime sectors and maritime regions. Good-quality information is required to monitor and assess the EU maritime policy and its programmes, to provide contextual information for sustainable coastal and ocean development, and to understand the linkages between socio-economic activities and the environment. In consultation with other Commission departments, Eurostat manages the development of a harmonised statistical database that brings together relevant regional and national statistics from different statistical domains.

An EU coastal region is a statistical region defined at NUTS 3 level, with a sea border or having more than half of its population within 50 km from the sea. According to this definition, 446 EU coastal regions have been selected. These regions belong to the 22 Member States with a coastline. Among these 446 coastal regions, 372 have a coastline and 73 meet the second criterion. Finally, the German region of Hamburg, which does not correspond to the definition criteria, has been added to the EU coastal regions list, taking into account its strong maritime influence.

Further efforts are now necessary to consolidate results achieved and to improve them in order to monitor the cyclical situation in the euro area, in the European Union and in major economic partners. Reliable business cycle analysis strongly depends on the availability and quality of infra-annual statistics. Eurostat is actively working to further improve the quality and the coverage of Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIs, COMM/2002/661) and to enhance their visibility. Traditional compilation approaches will be supplemented by sophisticated statistical and econometric techniques in order to increase the timeliness, length, frequency and reliability of PEEIs. Eurostat will continue increasing data readability and interpretability by supplying analysts, economists and policy makers with sophisticated statistical analysis. Eurostat will also step up its efforts in defining and maintaining a statistical framework for the assessment of the cyclical situation. Work in 2010 will focus on the construction of new high-frequency macroeconomic indicators and on improving the statistical framework for business cycle analysis to supply a better service to economists and analysts. Key priorities in 2010 will be: (1) integrating traditional methods with more sophisticated econometric techniques; (2) strengthening harmonisation by defining new guidelines and implementing seasonal adjustment guidelines for short-term statistics; (3) defining a comprehensive statistical framework for euro-area and European Union business cycle analysis to facilitate real-time economic assessment; (4) monitoring and assessing PEEIs.

Module Description The objective of the Eurotrend module is to develop and promote statistical and econometric techniques to improve the overall quality of PEEIs and to develop a sophisticated statistical framework for business cycle analysis. Such techniques will be applied to increase the timeliness of PEEIs (flash estimates), their length (back-calculation), and their availability at higher frequency (temporal disaggregation techniques). Moreover sophisticated de-trending techniques and methods for the construction of synthetic indicators are extensively used to derive an up-to-date and consistent picture of the cyclical situation. This module also deals with harmonisations of the production process of PEEIs by means of guidelines in key areas such as seasonal adjustment, revisions analysis and estimation. 2.

        "DOMAIN 5 Multi-domain statistics 219 Statistical Requirements Compendium - 2010 edition Theme 5.02 Europe 2020 strategy and sustainable development Description Key policy areas likely to shape the development of the EU in the coming years include two overarching and complementary strategies: while the goal of the Lisbon Strategy is for the EU to \u2018become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u2019, the Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) concerns the continuous improvement of quality of life, both for current and for future generations, through reconciliation of economic development, social cohesion and protection of the environment. Eurostat produces and disseminates indicators to monitor these two strategies, namely (i) the structural indicators (SIs) for the Lisbon Strategy are used to underpin the Commission\u2019s analysis in the annual progress report to the European Council, and (ii) the sustainable development indicators (SDIs) range across the multiple factors affecting quality of life, including environmental, social, economic and governance issues, and underpin the six-monthly monitoring report on the Sustainable Development Strategy. Those sets of indicators have been discussed and agreed at political level. Eurostat aims to continuously monitor, improve and review these indicators in order to be in line with evolving policy requirements and communications (in particular the \"GDP and beyond\" Communication 1 and the Stiglitz-Sen report. Recent developments in the world\u2019s economy have led to a need to monitor globalisation (mostly exchanges and links between EU and non-EU countries) and the well-being of people in addition to GDP. Two new sets of \u2018long-term\u2019 indicators are being developed or should be developed to satisfy this need: Globalisation Indicators (GIs) and Well Being Indicators (WBIs), both in close coordination with other international activities such as those of the OECD. 1 Communication of the Commission \"GDP and beyond.

Module Description The Europe 2020 is the new strategy for the European Union for the next decade and the successor of the Lisbon Strategy. It therefore sets out a vision for Europe's social market economy and rests on three interlocking and mutually reinforcing priority areas: \u2022 smart growth (fostering knowledge, innovation, education and digital society) \u2022 sustainable growth (making our production more resource efficient while boosting our competitiveness) \u2022 inclusive growth (raising participation in the labour market, the acquisition of skills and the fight against poverty) Similarly, like under the Lisbon process, the Europe 2020 Strategy will use a revised set of structural indicators for monitoring the progress made in achieving the objectives of the new strategy. The indicators will be compiled by Eurostat and will be used within the annual monitoring exercise. The proposed set of structural indicators should contain also some basic data on overall economic performance of the EU. For several of the indicators, target values at EU and individual countries levels should be determined in line with the policy objectives. The Europe 2020 strategy puts emphasis also on comparing EU performance internationally. The current list of non-EU countries within the existing set of structural indicators will thus be further extended to include additional countries, e.g. BRIC, if the data are available. 2. Legal Basis Other basis: For Structural Indicators: The Commission's documents as well as other relevant material are available on the following webpage: http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/index_en.htm At present, Eurostat D5 maintains a set of round 80 structural indicators (long list) on its website arranged within 6 themes (General economic background, Employment, Innovation and Research, Economic Reform, Social Cohesion and Environment). For further information: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/structuralindicators This set reflects the objectives and targets of the Lisbon strategy.

The four main policy areas identified by the 6th EAP are climate change; nature and biodiversity; environment and health and quality of life; natural resources and waste. The Treaties and subsequently the 6th EAP also emphasise the need to continue the process of integrating environmental concerns into all relevant policy areas and ensure better and more accessible information on the environment for policy makers, businesses, citizens and other stakeholders. Work on the collection, validation and dissemination of environmental data and the development of indicators will be harmonised in the framework of the Environmental Data Centres (DCs) for Natural Resources, Products and Waste, as agreed by the Group of Four (Directorate-General Environment, European Environment Agency \u2014 EEA, Joint Research Centre \u2014 JRC and Eurostat) in 2005. They are intended to act as \"information hubs\" and to be the first contact points for information on each of the related policies. At international level, Eurostat actively contributes to the harmonisation of methodologies and statistics on the environment through the Inter-secretariat Working Group on Environment Statistics (IWG-ENV), through cooperation with the OECD and in environmental accounts through the United Nations Committee of Experts on Economic-Environmental Accounting (UNCEEA) and the \u2018London Group\u2019.

Since 1988, the Commission has put in place an integrated policy for social and economic cohesion within which regional statistics play an essential role in the decision implementation process: the eligibility of zones under regional objectives is determined on the basis of socio-economic criteria with respect to certain thresholds; financial allocations to Member States are decided objectively on the basis of statistical indicators. In addition, evaluation of the impact of Community policies at regional level and the quantification of regional disparities are possible only with access to extensive regional- and urban-based statistics. A number of departments within the Commission make use of data at municipality level for the drafting, implementation and evaluation of the policies for which they are responsible, in particular regional, competition, transport and agricultural policy.

Moreover, geographically located information is becoming even more important as a source for statistics and analyses, presenting great potential both for developing new statistics and for illustration and communication purposes. This trend will become increasingly evident in the next few years as technology advances and data become more extensively available. Eurostat, as manager of the Commission\u2019s reference database, must meet this challenge. Eurostat, in association with the JRC and DG ENV, will continue to support the implementation of INSPIRE following the adoption of the Directive. This covers infrastructure and drafting of specific regulations as envisaged in the programme but also the initiation of operational and decision-making support (in particular the continuing work of the INSPIRE committee).

The high political priority of these statistics is demonstrated by the inclusion of indicators on the information society among the structural indicators, as well as the decision to monitor progress towards the i2010 goals through a system of benchmarking indicators which have been renewed in 2009. The main legal basis for action is Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 concerning Community statistics on the information society and its annual implementing measures. The Regulation was amended in 2009 and will cover the provision of statistical data until 2019. It has provided a framework for developing a flexible system of collecting statistics on the information society. Cooperation with other international organisations will continue to improve consistency of methods and indicators for better comparability of data at international level. New methodology (e.g. on measuring ICT expenditure and investment and other evolving ways of electronic communication) will be implemented and current methodology will be improved in this rapidly changing area. Concerning the ICT supply side, work on the definition of a conceptual framework and the collection of statistics on the ICT sector from other statistical domains will continue. Depending on newly defined priority areas within the post-i2010 benchmarking process, new indicators for monitoring topics of special interest will have to be developed. ",

It entails a particular duty on the part of Eurostat (and NSIs and other national authorities) to ensure the physical and logical protection of confidential data (statistical disclosure control \u2014 SDC) and the harmonisation of principles and guidelines in this domain. In the new Regulation the Commission is given implementing powers for that purpose. Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes aims to satisfy the needs of the scientific community for access to confidential statistical information. Eurostat has to implement the principles set out in this Regulation and to meet the expectations of users. As from entry into force of the Regulation on European statistics, Regulation 831/2002 continues to apply but will eventually have to be replaced to take into account recent legal, methodological and technical developments in this field. Furthermore, the increase in confidential data available to Eurostat, the methodological/technical progress made, and the need to better harmonise Eurostat practice and to promote knowledge transfer in the ESS will guide methodological activity aimed at providing tools and methods of statistical disclosure control. Eurostat must also continuously evaluate the Regulations in view of the need to maximise the benefits of confidential data with the aim of increasing the quality of EU statistics and to improve the conditions for access to confidential data while ensuring a high level of protection. For the coming years, the challenge for data security will be to give remote access for better productivity and still ensure confidentiality of the data. Web access to databases will have to be organised and protected to prevent web hacking. ",
