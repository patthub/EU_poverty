        "In January 2002 the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) beca- me an autonomous Paris-based agency of the European Union. Following an EU Council Joint Action of 20 July 2001, it is now an integral part of the new structures that will support the further development of the CFSP/ESDP. The Institute\u2019s core mission is to provide analyses and recommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulation of the European security and defence policy. In carrying out that mission, it also acts as an interface between European experts and decision-makers at all levels. Chaillot Papers are monographs on topical questions written either by a member of the ISS research team or by outside authors chosen and commissioned by the Institute. Early drafts are normally discussed at a semi- nar or study group of experts convened by the Institute and publication indicates that the paper is considered by the ISS as a useful and authoritative contribution to the debate on CFSP/ESDP. Responsibility for the views expressed in them lies exclusively with authors.

        "Introduction 1 With the European Union\u2019s enlargement eastwards and southwards, its neighbourhood now stretches from the Balkans to the south Cau- casus, and from Russia to the southern Mediterranean. The EU\u2019s eastern and southern neighbourhood is composed of areas which, to a greater or lesser extent, have serious deficits in security, develop- ment and democracy. There are many types of security problems, ranging from weak states and rampant international crime to spoil- ers in post-conflict reconstruction and unpredictable authoritarian leaders who pursue regime security often at the expense of national or regional security. In terms of socio-economic development, most of the countries in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood are fragile, often strug- gling with the effects of black market economies and cronyism, and burdened by bloated defence and security sectors that escape any accountability. As regards political systems, the EU\u2019s neighbour- hood is composed of regime types ranging from new but weak democracies to regimes with authoritarian features and limited political participation. 2 The combined effects of these deficits constitute a serious chal- lenge for the EU\u2019s own security as well as an impediment to its attempts at shaping its neighbourhood according to its interests and preferences. Over the past few years, the EU has designed numerous instruments to engage these regions through different policies with the purpose of addressing these deficits. They include the accession process for candidate countries, stabilisation, associa- tion and partnership agreements, multilateral frameworks such as the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) or the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, and more recently the European Neigh- bourhood Policy (ENP), which includes the \u2018new\u2019 neighbours in the east and the south. 3 The issue areas covered under such partner- ships include development cooperation, human rights and democ- ratisation, as well as conflict prevention and crisis management. The neighbours have differing relationships with the EU, and most importantly can be distinguished on the basis of their 7 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 1.

        "prospects of one day becoming EU members. The countries likely to join the EU in the mid-to long term include those of the Western Balkans and Turkey (although the plebiscitary rejection of the EU constitution by France and the Netherlands has cast some doubts on these prospects). All of them are engaged, and assisted by the EU, in a process of political and economic reform. The other neighbours are those that have no EU membership prospects, at least not for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, in this situation the EU has much less leverage to promote political and economic reforms. However, the need for reform is paramount throughout the EU\u2019s neighbourhood, as is the need for the EU to assist these countries in their reform efforts. In addition to this, the EU is under some pres- sure from the United States, which under the Bush administration has embarked on promoting political and economic liberalisation in order to create an \u2018arc of reform\u2019 in the Arab world that also cov- ers large parts of the EU\u2019s neighbourhood. It is clear that no genuine political and economic liberalisation can be carried out as long as the defence and security sectors con- tinue to be run by uniformed \u00e9lites that lack political accountability and transparency. The absence of democratic control of the mili- tary, police, intelligence services and other security forces has seri- ous consequences with regards to the internal and external security, as well as the political and economic development, of countries in transition. Furthermore, opacity of the security sector is often a cause for regional instability. Given the importance of a well-gov- erned and efficient security sector to national and regional security, as well as socio-economic development and democratisation, the need to promote good governance of the security sector seems self- evident. The 2003 European Security Strategy (ESS), for example, acknowledges the importance of supporting third countries in \u2018security sector reform\u2019 and refers to it in the context of \u2018broader institution building\u2019. 4 However, given the fact that issues such as defence and intelli- gence continue to be regarded as a chasse gard\u00e9e of the state or the regime in power, the EU\u2019s involvement in this field is politically at least as sensitive as its engagement in the domain of human rights. Moreover, activities aimed at reforming security and defence sectors are prone to clash with national agendas of those EU member states that prefer realpolitik over transformation focused on good gover- nance. Yet in view of the fact that the EU has become an interna- tional actor in its own right, it will increasingly be faced with the 8 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 4.

        "needs and pressures to engage in the promotion of security sector governance. This results from the EU being a pluralistic community of liberal democracies and as such a democracy-promoter. Also, the concept of democratic control of the armed forces and parliamen- tary oversight of defence budgets has been adopted by other regional organisations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa- tion (NATO) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), both of which are increasingly reaching out to the southern Mediterranean and beyond. In view of the growing importance of security sector governance, this study will examine the extent to which the EU is able to address this question with its neighbours and how it interacts, if at all, with other multilateral actors promoting democratic governance of the security sector in its eastern and southern neighbourhood. 5 The record of recent years has shown that the EU is increasingly engaged in the promotion of security sector governance. However, to date the EU has neither developed a comprehensive policy framework nor mainstreamed its manifold activities aimed, intentionally or not, at promoting security sector governance. Furthermore, it pur- sues the reform of security institutions such as police forces, border guards or judicial systems on a piecemeal basis, often neglecting the crucial governance dimension. This study will look at both the normative and policy dimen- sions of security sector governance, as well as issues related to oper- ational implementation. Before exploring the EU\u2019s current approach, the study will present the emerging concepts of security sector governance and security sector reform as well as the key mul- tilateral actors engaged in promoting these concepts. It will then consider how the EU and other key actors such as NATO have assisted the eastern and southern neighbours in this politically sen- sitive domain. The paper ends by recommending that the EU develop a holistic approach to promoting security sector gover- nance. 9 Introduction 5.

        "Promoting security sector governance Since the 1990s, the promotion of security sector governance has become a recognised item on national and international policy agendas. In the framework of \u2018new defence diplomacy\u2019, Western governments began to promote democratic civil-military relations, in particular in post-communist Central and Eastern Europe, bilaterally as well as through multilateral security institutions. 6 Furthermore, in recognition of the security development nexus, bilateral and multilateral donors started to use the promotion of security sector governance as an instrument to improve the effi- ciency and effectiveness of development assistance. 7 Finally, secu- rity sector governance issues gained most practical relevance in the context of externally assisted post-conflict reconstruction of \u2018failed states\u2019 and states emerging from violent internal or inter- state conflict. 8 All these policy agendas are based on the assump- tion that a well governed security sector is a key factor for democra- tisation, socio-economic development, conflict prevention and peace building. This chapter first introduces the concept of security sector gov- ernance and its normative underpinnings. This is followed by a dis- cussion of security sector reform (SSR) as an increasingly accepted key instrument for improving security sector governance in transi- tional, developing and post-conflict countries. Finally, this chapter provides a brief overview of the principal actors involved in pro- moting security sector governance. What is security sector governance? 9 Security sector governance is a recent and still evolving concept which combines the broad notion of \u2018security\u2019 with the evolving concept of \u2018governance\u2019 and applies it to the \u2018security sector\u2019. This section shows how security sector governance may be conceptu- alised and what is comprised by the security sector. It also shows 11 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 6. See, for instance, Andrew Cottey and Anthony Forster, \u2018Re- shaping Defence Diplomacy.

        "1 that security sector governance is based on principles and best prac- tices which have been enshrined, though not in their entirety, in a number of international documents. Security, governance and security (sector) governance Since the end of the Cold War, we have witnessed a substantive widening and deepening of the concept of security . Non-military security issues such as its political, economic, societal and environ- mental aspects are now broadly accepted as component parts of a new security agenda. Furthermore, with the proliferation of intrastate wars \u2013 with cross-border implications \u2013 and the privati- sation of conflict in poorly governed and failing states, the interna- tional community began to recognise that more often than not it is individuals and social groups which need to be protected rather than the state whose dysfunctionality is often the primary cause of insecurity. This led to the emergence of new security concepts such as human security. Although still an ill-defined and contested con- cept, human security covers a wide range of threats to the security of individuals and social groups, such as anti-personnel land- mines, small arms and light weapons, child soldiers, trafficking in women as well as, in its wider notion, all aspects of human develop- ment such as economic, food, health and environmental insecu- rity. What makes these problems \u2018new\u2019 security issues, shaping a new or transformed international security agenda, is not that they are truly novel phenomena but rather that they are \u2018securitised\u2019, which means that they tend to be characterised and treated as secu- rity concerns. The concept of governance is quite a recent one which has come into use in the context of globalisation, reflecting the fragmenta- tion of political authority among public and private actors on mul- tiple levels of governance \u2013 international, national, and subna- tional \u2013 which has accompanied globalisation. In its basic notion, governance refers to the structures and processes whereby a social organisation \u2013 from the family to corporate business to interna- tional institutions \u2013 steers itself, ranging from centralised control to self-regulation. If we accept the perspective that every issue-area, including military and non-military security, is subject to certain systems of governance on the substate, state or international level, then we arrive at the concept of security governance. 10 At the state and substate levels, security governance is largely exercised by gov- 12 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 10. For an analysis on security gov- ernance see Elke Krahmann, \u2018Con- ceptualizing Security Gover- nance\u2019, Cooperation and Conflict , vol. 38, no. 1, pp. 5-26. cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:54 Page 12 ",
        "1 ernments \u2013 hence governance by governments \u2013 except for \u2018weak states\u2019 or \u2018failed states\u2019 where the government is forced to share powers with non-state actors, be it international organisations, for- eign powers, rebel forces or other armed non-state actors. In sum, security governance on the state level refers to the organisation, management and oversight of the security sector. The security sector Although the notion of the security sector is contested, there seems to be a certain convergence on a general definition, which may vary in scope according to the perspective adopted. From a security perspective, the notion reflects a broad concep- tion of security because it is not limited to the military, but rather acknowledges the importance and in some countries the predomi- nant role of non-military security forces in the provision of public security, internal or external. Accordingly, the security sector encompasses all those state institutions which have a formal man- date to ensure the safety of the state and its citizens from acts of vio- lence and coercion, such as the armed forces, the police, gen- darmerie and paramilitary forces, the intelligence and secret services, border guards as well as judicial and penal institutions. Given the prevalence of private and other non-statutory security actors in an increasing number of states, however, forces such as guerrilla and liberation armies, non-state paramilitary organisa- tions as well as private military and security companies have to be considered either as part of the de facto security sector or at least as important actors shaping security sector governance. Thus, the security sector, as defined from a broad security perspective, would include statutory and non-statutory security forces. From a governance perspective, the security sector covers the ele- ments of the public sector responsible for the exercise of the state monopoly of coercive power \u2013 traditionally a key feature of the modern nation-state. This includes the elected and duly appointed civil authorities responsible for management and control of the security forces, such as the executive government, the relevant min- istries (so-called \u2018power ministries\u2019, particularly the ministries of defence and of the interior), the parliament and its specialised com- mittees. Like any other part of the public sector, the security sector should be subject to principles of good governance such as accountability, transparency and participation. Given the broad 13 Promoting security sector governance cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:54 Page 13 ",
        "1 notion of security and the growing importance of internal security issues, particularly in the wake of 9/11 and its aftermath, justice and law enforcement institutions are also viewed as relevant actors for security sector governance. Thus, the judiciary and ministries of justice, criminal investigation and prosecution services, prison regimes, ombudspersons and human rights commissions should be considered as component parts of the security sector, broadly defined. Furthermore, given the importance of civil society for democratic governance, non-statutory civil society actors such as the media, research institutions and non-governmental organisa- tions may also play an important role in security sector governance. Thus, the security sector as defined from a democratic governance perspective, would include a wide range of civil society actors in addition to the state institutions tasked with security sector man- agement and oversight. Norms and standards of security sector governance Amongst the few international documents that refer to democratic governance of the security sector is the UN General Assembly Res- olution 55/96, entitled Promoting and Consolidating Democracy, which calls for \u2018ensuring that the military remains accountable to the democratically elected civilian government\u2019 in the context of strengthening the rule of law. 11 In its Human Development Report 2002, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) makes a strong case for \u2018democratizing security to prevent conflict and build peace\u2019. Referring to the democratic peace thesis, which posits that democracies do not go to war against each other, the report stresses the crucial role of democratic control of the mil- itary, police and other security forces for human development and human security. 12 Standards for democratic governance of the security sector have been set outside the UN system by a number of regional organisations such as the OSCE, NATO, the EU and the Council of Europe (see below). The OSCE has gone the furthest so far with the adoption in 1994 of the politically binding Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, which contains the most innovative provisions on \u2018the democratic political control of military, paramilitary and internal security forces as well as intel- ligence services and the police\u2019 (Annexe IV). In its sections VII and VIII, the Code establishes the basic components of democratic con- trol of armed forces regime, which is at the core of security sector 14 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 11.

From an institutional perspective, democratic governance of the security sector would include: (cid:90) a constitutional and legal framework which enshrines the separa- tion of powers (between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government) and clearly defines the tasks, rights and obligations of the security sector within the institutional checks and balances and of the individual security institutions (e.g. separation between police and military); (cid:90) civilian control and management of the security sector by govern- ment (civilian control over the defence ministry, other security- related ministries and the military establishment as a whole, with civilian defence and interior ministers and civil servants having key policy-making and management roles, and with a clear division of professional responsibility between civilians and the military); (cid:90) parliamentary control and oversight of the security sector (powers such as approval of defence and related budgets, security-related laws, security strategy and planning, security sector restructur- ing, weapons procurement, deployment of troops for internal emergency situations and abroad, ratification of international agreements on security issues; instruments such as defence committees, hearings, inquiries and investigations, mandating reports, etc.); (cid:90) judicial control in the sense that the security sector is subject to the civilian justice system, too, and that there are no specialized courts (e.g. military justice courts) outside the civil courts; and, (cid:90) \u2018 public control \u2019 of the security sector through the existence of a security community representing civil society (political parties, NGOs, independent media, specialised think tanks and univer- sity institutions, etc.) and the nurturing of an informed national debate on security issues. This body of widely recognised principles and practices effec- tively constitutes an ideal-type of security sector governance, which perhaps only a few countries are able to match in their entirety. Though there are no universally accepted models, civilian supremacy and legislative accountability (or civilian and parlia- 15 Promoting security sector governance 13.

        "1 mentary control) of the security sector are widely recognised as being the most crucial elements of the concept of democratic gov- ernance of the security sector. One should note that, far from tying their hands, democratic governance of the security sector offers long-term advantages for the security forces themselves. It provides them with the resources that are politically considered necessary. It also facilitates their effectiveness and efficiency because they are under external scrutiny, thereby giving them legitimacy and a socially accepted status. Profiling security sector reform (SSR) 14 Security sector reform (SSR) 15 is essentially aimed at the efficient and effective provision of state and human security within a frame- work of democratic governance. Although SSR is still an evolving and therefore contested concept, and lessons learned from practi- cal experience are still rather scarce, it increasingly shapes interna- tional programmes for development assistance, security coopera- tion and the promotion of democracy. This process is driven by the understanding that an unreformed security sector represents a decisive obstacle to the promotion of sustainable peace, democracy and development. The concept of SSR bridges the previously sepa- rate international discourses of security policy, the promotion of peace and democracy, and development assistance, which makes the SSR approach appear innovative and promising while simulta- neously rendering it demanding in terms of conceptualisation and actual implementation. The concept of security sector reform A security sector can be considered dysfunctional if it does not provide security to the state and its people or, even worse, if it is a cause of insecurity. Moreover, a security sector cannot be consid- ered to be functional if it is deficient in terms of governance. Thus, SSR is meant to reduce security deficits (lack of security or even provision of insecurity) as well as democratic deficits (lack of over- sight of the security sector). In other words, SSR is a means that serves the objective of providing \u2018security within the state in an effective and efficient manner, and in the framework of demo- cratic civilian control\u2019. 16 16 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 14. This section draws on H\u00e4nggi, \u2018Conceptualising\u2019, op. cit., pp. 8- 15. 15. \u2018Security sector reform \u2019 is the term of choice in this paper be- cause it is most commonly used by practitioners as well as analysts. Reference is made, however, to al- ternative terms such as \u2018security system reform\u2019, used by the Devel- opment Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and De- velopment (OECD); \u2018 justice and se- curity sector reform\u2019, introduced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); and \u2018secu- rity sector transformation \u2019, which is increasingly being used in the African context to underline the need for fundamental change in governance processes in the secu- rity sector. 16.

        "1 In an address to the World Bank staff in October 1999, UN Sec- retary-General Kofi Annan made a strong case for security sector reform. Referring to the concept of good governance, he noted that \u2018another very important aspect is the reform of public services \u2013 including the security sector, which should be subject to the same standards of efficiency, equity and accountability as any other service.\u2019 17 A recent authoritative definition of SSR stems from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that \u2018security system reform is another term used to describe the transformation of the security system \u2013 which includes all the actors, their roles, responsibilities and actions \u2013 working together to manage and operate the system in a manner that is more consistent with democratic norms and sound princi- ples of good governance and this contributes to a well-functioning security framework.\u2019 18 Thus, the SSR agenda favours a holistic approach to the provi- sion of security in a double sense, firstly, by integrating all those partial reforms such as defence reform, police reform, intelligence reform and judicial reform, which in the past were generally seen and conducted as separate efforts. Secondly, given its normative commitment to the consolidation of democracy, promotion of human rights and implementation of the principles of good gov- ernance such as accountability and transparency, it aims at put- ting the security sector and its components under democratic gov- ernance. Developmental, post-authoritarian and post-conflict settings In practical terms, SSR varies substantially according to the spe- cific reform context. There is general agreement that no common model of SSR exists and that, in principle, each country adopting SSR constitutes a special case and hence a different reform context. However, for analytical purposes, broad SSR contexts may be dis- tinguished which contain a number of similar cases \u2013 depending on the criteria for categorisation. In this paper three such contexts, or rather \u2018context clusters\u2019, of SSR will be discussed, each reflecting a different rationale for reform. If the level of economic develop- ment, the nature of the political system and the specific security sit- uation are used as points of departure, the following three SSR con- texts may be distinguished (see table below): 17 Promoting security sector governance 17.

        "1 (cid:90) the developmental context in relatively stable developing coun- tries (key criterion: socio-economic development); (cid:90) the post-authoritarian (primarily post-communist) context in transitional countries (key criterion: political system); (cid:90) the \u2018post-conflict context\u2019 in countries engaged in rebuilding the state after conflict (key criterion: security situation). 19 Good opportunities for externally assisted SSR activities tend to exist in developing countries which have embarked on a process of democratisation after elections or other forms of peaceful change, in post-authoritarian transition states which aim at join- ing a regional organisation for which democracy is a requirement for membership (e.g. potential EU and NATO members), and those post-conflict states in which multinational peace support opera- tions offer the bases for reconstruction and local actors show a cer- tain readiness for reform. At this stage, Ghana, Mali and Senegal could be viewed as good examples of the first category, Ukraine and Indonesia the second, and possibly Afghanistan and Sierra Leone the third. In some cases, potential target countries would consti- tute a specific hybrid of these contexts such as the West Balkan countries and Georgia, which combine the features of the post- authoritarian (post-communist) and post-conflict contexts. In many cases, however, prospects for the promotion of security sec- tor governance and externally assisted SSR are rather dim. In par- ticular, this applies to authoritarian regimes and illiberal democra- cies where the will to reform is lacking (e.g. Belarus, North African states) and to \u2018post-conflict\u2019 states and territories located in early conflict transformation phases (e.g. Iraq, Ivory Coast, Nepal, Sri Lanka or Sudan). This does not mean that security sector gover- nance should not be promoted in these countries, but that this task will be even more challenging than it already is in more conducive environments \u2013 and with high political risks attached. 18 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 19. One should, however, be aware that highly developed countries, consolidated democra- cies and states which are internally and externally secure also face pressures to reform their security sectors, particularly in response to new security requirements accen- tuated by 9/11 and its aftermath or to deficiencies in international security governance related to the effects of globalisation. cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 18 ",

        "1 Three categories of SSR-related activities Finally, the range of SSR activities that are recommended and implemented by the actors involved is quite extraordinary. Three broad categories can be distinguished: (cid:90) restructuring security institutions : these SSR activities concentrate on the reduction of security deficits by building transparent, responsible, efficient and effective security forces \u2013 armed forces, police services, border guards, intelligence services, etc., that are capable of providing security rather than posing a secu- rity threat; (cid:90) strengthening control mechanisms : these SSR activities focus on the reduction of democratic deficits through the promotion of good governance in the security sector \u2013 by strengthening control and oversight mechanisms in the context of civilian management, parliamentary accountability and civil society empowerment; (cid:90) reconstructing the security sector : these SSR activities relate to spe- cific challenges posed by post-conflict environments such as SSR-related activities of international peace support opera- tions, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants, including child soldiers, combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons (SALW), mine action, etc. It has to be emphasised that activities aimed at modernising and professionalising the armed and security forces (first cate- gory) without assuring their democratic accountability (second category) cannot be considered as SSR in the framework of secu- rity sector governance. Such activities would rather come under the heading of technical assistance in the framework of \u2018old defence diplomacy\u2019, which was aimed at beefing up the armed and security forces of allies irrespective of governance considera- tions. 21 By definition, SSR-related activities must be aimed at improving the governance of the security sector. 22 (cid:90) For the purposes of this paper, an inventory of activities related to the promotion of security sector governance has been devel- oped \u2013 based on the three categories just mentioned and draw- ing on the pertinent literature (see Annexe 5). This inventory is not complete but provides a useful checklist which enables one to ascertain and categorise security sector governance and SSR- related activities pursued by the EU \u2013 or any other international actors in this field. 20 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 21.

        "1 Key international organisations promoting security sector governance As in the case of the promotion of democracy, development assistance and peace-building, three clusters of actors are involved in promoting security sector governance \u2013 national gov- ernments, non-governmental organisations and international organisations. 23 National governments such as that of the United Kingdom have played a key role in promoting democratic civil-military relations in post-communist countries in transi- tion and in putting SSR on the development agenda of donor countries. Non-governmental organisations such as the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) have been playing an increasingly important role in supporting SSR-related activities in specific countries, both in stand-alone efforts and as part of programmes sponsored by governments and international organisations. The key actors in promoting security sector governance, however, have been international organisations, both global and regional. Developmental organi- sations such as OECD, UNDP and the World Bank have been the most active at the global level. The OECD has concentrated on the conceptualisation of \u2018security system reform\u2019 in the context of development cooperation, while the UNDP and, to a lesser extent, the World Bank have also been engaged in implementing SSR-related activities on the ground, albeit not necessarily under that label. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has been confronted with SSR challenges in a number of post-conflict settings. Although regional organisations in Africa and Latin America have also been involved in promoting security sector gover- nance, 24 it is in the Euro-Atlantic area that several multilateral institutions have been empowered to put the issue of democratic governance of the security sector onto their policy agenda. In the early 1990s, the OSCE and NATO began to formally address the question of democratic control of the armed forces. The OSCE took up the task of norm-setting as evidenced by the adoption of its Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, and NATO undertook the process of transferring these norms in the framework of its Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme and later also through its enlargement process. In the late 1990s, the Coun- cil of Europe and the EU, both within their respective mandates, 21 Promoting security sector governance 23.

        "1 began to promote security sector governance primarily in the non- military dimension. It is on the activities of these Euro-Atlantic institutions that this section will focus. OSCE: norms and standards setter in the post-communist period The OSCE has been instrumental in creating a normative environ- ment for security sector governance ever since the end of the Cold War. As a cooperative and comprehensive security organisation, it has an all-inclusive approach to peace and security, both in inter- nal and international security. The organisation has a rich experi- ence in norm- and standard-setting in the areas of confidence- building, arms control and disarmament, and security cooperation. With regards to democratic governance of the secu- rity sector, the OSCE approached the issue area through its Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security (1994). It is noteworthy that the EU was a key contributor to the creation of the Code (see Chapter 2). The rationale pursued by some member states was that the creation of the Code of Conduct would eventu- ally lead to a pan-European or CSCE (as it then was) security treaty. These objectives died on the battlefields of former Yugoslavia, but the Code has remained important as a point of ref- erence in this domain. The Code contains numerous commitments and reaffirma- tions of commitments in issue-areas ranging from confidence- building, arms control and disarmament, conflict prevention and crisis management to the democratic control and use of armed forces. The Code constitutes the first multilateral instrument embodying rules regulating the democratic control of armed forces, at both internal and international levels. It has, however, several deficiencies. First, it applies only to the armed forces, but not to the security sector at large. Second, its implementation and review mechanisms have no \u2018teeth\u2019, and non-compliance of OSCE states with the Code have not led to any policy responses by the OSCE community. 25 In recent years, the OSCE has held a number of seminars on the Code and specific aspects addressed by the Code, mainly in Cen- tral Asia and the Caucasus. Beyond that, the OSCE has also been active on the ground by supporting activities aimed at improving the parliamentary accountability of the security sector, the 22 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 25. For instance, in the context of Russia\u2019s use of military force in Chechnya, the EU has repeat- edly called upon Moscow to ful- fil its obligations under the OSCE Code of Conduct. cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 22 ",
        "1 strengthening of border security regimes and preventing human rights violations in armed forces. NATO: the transfer of norms through enlargement and part- nership NATO is not only a defence alliance or a security institution dedi- cated to crisis management and peace building, but also an alliance based on liberal values. Shared democratic values and norms are at the heart of NATO\u2019s legitimacy. It is on the basis of this common identity \u2018that NATO in the post-Cold War period has turned to focus on democracy promotion as a core principle for its activities\u2019. 26 NATO\u2019s democracy promotion agenda of the 1990s was driven primarily by the United States in view of NATO\u2019s eastward enlargement. In 1994 this approach took the form of the PfP pro- gramme, which was to pull former Warsaw Pact enemies into NATO\u2019s collaborative orbit. The democratic requirements relat- ing to security sector governance were codified in the PfP Frame- work Document (1994) and the Membership Action Plan (1999). The PfP Framework Document explicitly lists, as two of its objec- tives, \u2018the facilitation of transparency in national defence plan- ning\u2019 and \u2018ensuring democratic control of defence forces\u2019. 27 In 1999, NATO worked out two parallel tracks that should promote security sector governance for (a) future member states and (b) for other non-NATO countries of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). For future NATO members, a Membership Action Plan (MAP) has been set up to help them in their defence transformation. Can- didate countries follow an Annual National Programme that posits the objectives and benchmarks for reform. At present, three countries \u2013 Albania, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) \u2013 are part of the MAP process. The MAP con- tains a catalogue of preconditions and expectations with regards to aspirant countries. It builds upon the PfP Framework Docu- ment and its requirements cover the fields of democratic gover- nance of the security sector, human rights, security policy, strat- egy, Alliance policies, and legal commitments. In particular, it requires states to \u2018establish appropriate democratic and civilian control\u2019 of their armed forces. 28 NATO\u2019s MAP has also acquired the status of a normative reference document for countries out- 23 Promoting security sector governance 26.

For other non-NATO countries, the Alliance developed the NATO Partnership Work Programme 2000-2001, which contains numerous concepts related to the democratic governance of the security sector. The Work Programme also calls upon the partici- pating states to \u2018[d]iscuss progress in the implementation of the OSCE Code of Conduct\u2019. The main mechanisms to support part- ner countries in their efforts to build a democratic defence sector are the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) and the PfP Planning And Review Process (PARP). Furthermore, at NATO\u2019s 2002 Prague summit, a Partnership Action Plan against Terror- ism was adopted, which established a clear link between pre- paredness to fight terrorism and security sector reform. 29 Finally, at the 2004 Istanbul summit, a Partnership Action Plan on Defence Institution Building (PAP-DIB) was endorsed. It is underpinned by the belief that defence institutions should be subordinate to civilian and democratic oversight mechanisms. 30 The PAP-DIB is primarily aimed at supporting EAPC countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia in establishing democratically controlled defence institutions. NATO and its member states have provided a wide range of support to PfP partners to help them reform their security sectors, particularly in the areas of constitutional frameworks for demo- cratic control of the military, reorganisation and civilianisation of defence ministries, defence planning and budgeting, and parlia- mentary accountability. This support has taken the form of con- ferences and seminars, advice on specific issues, placement of advisers from NATO, secondments of partner states\u2019 civilian and military personnel to NATO\u2019s political and military headquarters, as well as the PARP and MAP processes. 31 While NATO\u2019s SSR- related support was initially focused on the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic region, it now concen- trates on the Newly Independent States (NIS) such as Ukraine and Moldova, the south Caucasus and Central Asian republics. At its 2004 Istanbul summit, NATO launched new partnership initia- tives aimed also at the southern Mediterranean and the Middle East (see Chapter 4). 24 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 29.

        "1 Council of Europe: setting and promoting standards of demo- cratic security The main objective of the Council of Europe is to contribute to effi- cient implementation of pluralistic democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which constitutes a guarantee of stability and secu- rity between states and within states. In the immediate post-Cold War period, the Council of Europe played an important role in assisting the countries in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe as well as the NIS in the transformation of their political systems. Membership of the Council of Europe became a require- ment \u2013 a kind of a democratic \u2018certificate\u2019 \u2013 for the European coun- tries in transition willing to accede to other organisations such as NATO and the EU. While traditional (military) security issues are not covered by its mandate, the Council of Europe has in recent years begun to look into non-military aspects of security \u2013 reflecting the emerg- ing broad notion of security and its overlap with the Council\u2019s concept of democratic security. In 1997, the Directorate General of Human Rights launched the still ongoing \u2018Police and Human Rights\u2019 programme with the aim of raising awareness about human right standards in policing organisations throughout Europe, with training courses being concentrated in Western Balkan countries, the NIS and Turkey. 32 In 1999, its Parliamen- tary Assembly passed a recommendation on \u2018Control of internal security services in Council of Europe member states\u2019, which was not, however, followed up by the Committee of Ministers. 33 In 2001, the Committee of Ministers approved a Code of Police Ethics, which includes fairly detailed and specific principles of police accountability and has been promoted through a number of operational programmes. 34 In 2002, the Parliamentary Assem- bly, in its opinion on the membership application of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, now Serbia and Montenegro, listed legis- lation \u2018to bring the army under civilian control\u2019 among the acces- sion criteria. 35 Finally, in June 2005, a Recommendation on the \u2018Democratic oversight of the security sector in member states\u2019 was adopted and referred to the Council of Ministers for further action. 36 Apart from these core issues of security sector governance, the Council of Europe has been very active in a number of related areas such as programmes to promote access to justice and to fight traf- ficking in human beings. 25 Promoting security sector governance 32.

The next chapter lists the various EU policies and activities that can be related to the promotion of security sector reform and governance. 26 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 26 ",
        "The European Union\u2019s approach This chapter reviews the EU\u2019s approach to security sector gover- nance and security sector reform. It rests on the assumption that the EU\u2019s efforts to stabilise its neighbourhood have inevitably led to promoting security sector governance in its external policy, and will continue to do so, without necessarily applying the SSR label to these activities. Furthermore, the EU\u2019s nature as a hybrid inter- governmental-supranational organisation would suggest that its security sector governance activities would be pursued by differ- ent institutional actors within the Union, and in different policy areas, without these always being linked to each other. In the first section, this chapter examines EU policies that are relevant to security sector governance. This is followed by the development of a profile of the EU\u2019s activities in promoting security sector gover- nance, based on the conceptual framework presented in the previ- ous chapter. The lack of a comprehensive policy framework References to security sector governance promotion can be found in a number of EU documents and actual policies across all three areas under consideration: the promotion of democracy, develop- ment cooperation and security policy. SSR-relevant EU policies and instruments include the enlargement policy, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), develop- ment cooperation and external assistance, conflict prevention, civilian and military crisis management as well as justice and home affairs (JHA). The promotion of democracy The EU has not yet developed an explicit democracy promotion strategy.

        "2 agenda of the EU\u2019s enlargement policy and its \u2018human rights and democratisation policy\u2019. Enlargement policy The accession to the EU of former communist states from Central and Eastern Europe and beyond has put security sector governance issues on the agenda of the Union\u2019s enlargement policy, albeit indi- rectly. As early as 1993, the EU made democratic governance one of the three Copenhagen criteria, which stipulate that any European state may apply to become a member of the EU provided it enjoys (1) the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; (2) a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressures within the Union; and (3) the ability to take on the obligations of membership (meaning effective implementa- tion of the acquis communautaire ). 37 These criteria did not, however, contain any specific language on security sector governance or intrastate civil-military relations, which one might have expected to be included under the political condition of stable democratic institutions. Nevertheless, there was no doubt that democratic governance of the security sector was implicitly considered as being part and parcel of the EU accession requirements. This was expressed in a number of bilateral agreements with accession and potential can- didate countries, which included references to the need to improve specific aspects of security sector governance such as police reform, judicial reform and border security management. The European Parliament, with the adoption of \u2018Agenda 2000\u2019 in 1997, provided further guidelines for accession by specifying that the Copenhagen criteria should include, inter alia , some essential elements with regard to security sector governance, namely the need to establish \u2018legal accountability of police, military and secret services\u2019 and \u2018the acceptance of the principle of conscientious objection to military service\u2019. 38 In the meantime, the principle of civilian control of the military has become an explicit requirement for accession under the politi- cal Copenhagen criteria. In the case of Turkey, the Commission has pointed to the problematic role of the National Security Council (NSC) in Turkey\u2019s polity in all of its annual progress reports since 1998. The principle of \u2018civilian control of the military\u2019 was men- tioned for the first time in the 2001 progress report, however, only 28 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 37.

        "2 in the context of the NSC. Finally, in 2003, the European Council identified reform of the National Security Council so as to \u2018align civilian control of the military with the practice in EU member states\u2019 as one of the priorities in the accession process. 39 While ref- erences to the principle of democratic control of armed forces have so far been confined to the role of the NSC in the case of Turkey, the EU has gone beyond this in the case of the Western Balkans. In the annual reports on the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) countries, the armed forces have been included in the assessment of democratic institutions, and the principle of civilian control of armed forces has become a requirement for closer association with the EU (see Chapter 3). In other words: the EU is de facto using a comprehensive notion of security sector governance in its enlarge- ment policy, with the armed forces being dealt with under the first Copenhagen criterion (democratic institutions) while police forces, border guards and the judiciary are reviewed under the JHA chapter of the acquis communautaire , which is part of the third Copenhagen criterion. Human rights and democratisation policy Developed in the early 1990s, the EU\u2019s human rights and democra- tisation policy became a cross-cutting issue of increasing impor- tance for its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) as well as its development cooperation policy. The 1993 Treaty on European Union declares \u2018democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\u2019 as one of the objectives of the CFSP, and stipulates that Community policy in the area of development cooperation \u2018shall contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that respect of respecting human rights and fundamental free- doms\u2019. 40 Since the early 1990s, and more systematically since the mid-1990s, the EU has included a so-called \u2018human rights clause\u2019 in its bilateral agreements with third countries, including Associa- tion Agreements such as the Europe Agreements and the Mediter- ranean Agreements. More recently, questions of democratic partic- ipation, human rights and rule of law have been included in the Country Strategy Papers and country-specific European Neigh- bourhood Policy (ENP) Action Plans, which are drawn up jointly with partner countries. Furthermore, programmes aimed at pro- moting human rights and democratic governance have become a key area of the Community\u2019s development assistance. 29 The European Union\u2019s approach 39. \u2018Council Decision of 19 May 2003 on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and con- ditions contained in the Accession partnership with Turkey\u2019, 2003/ 398/EC, Annexe, point 4. 40.

        "2 The EU\u2019s main funding vehicle for human rights and democ- racy promotion is the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which was created in 1994 by the Euro- pean Parliament. Approximately \u20ac 100 million are available annu- ally under EIDHR to support human rights, democratisation and conflict prevention activities to be carried out primarily in partner- ship with NGOs and international organisations. However, the Community\u2019s external assistance programmes such as PHARE, TACIS, MEDA and CARDS, which total some \u20ac 5 billion per annum, are also available for the funding of programmes aimed at human rights and democracy promotion. 41 The EU\u2019s strategy for promoting democracy has been criticised in the past, both internally 42 and externally, 43 for its lack of strategic vision and clear priorities. In order to present a more coherent pol- icy framework for all EU activities in this field, since 1995 the Com- mission has issued a series of communications on the EU\u2019s human rights and democratisation approach, the most recent one being The European Union\u2019s Role in Promoting Human Rights and Democratisation in Third Countries which, having been issued in May 2001, has introduced some coherence into this field and made support for strengthening democratisation, good governance and rule of law in collaboration with civil society actors one of four the- matic priorities of the future EIDHR programme. 44 The EIDHR programmes have since been restructured according to these new guidelines. 45 Though no explicit reference to democratic gover- nance of the security sector is to be found in these documents, 46 a number of EU-funded projects may have an indirect impact on secu- rity sector governance, particularly in areas such as judicial reform, policing, the fight against organised crime, the fight against torture and impunity and for international tribunals and the International Criminal Court (ICC). In sum, despite a whole range of activities in the field of human rights and democratisation, the promotion of security sector governance has never really been an integral part of the EU\u2019s democracy promotion agenda. Development cooperation The EU \u2013 the member states plus the European Community \u2013 has become the major international player in the development process, providing approximately half of all public assistance to developing countries. The EU development policy is based on the principle of 30 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 41. The existing EU system of fi- nancial instruments for the deliv- ery of external assistance will soon be simplified. From 2007 on- wards, the new instrument for Pre- Accession will replace existing in- struments such as PHARE and CARDS, and the new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument will replace existing in- struments such as MEDA and part of TACIS and EIDHR.

        "2 sustainable, equitable and participatory human and social devel- opment. Promotion of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance is considered to be an integral part of it. As mentioned above, since the early 1990s human rights and democ- racy promotion have become cross-cutting issues of increasing importance for the EU\u2019s development cooperation policy. More recently, the concept of good governance, aimed at ensuring effec- tive, transparent and responsible management of all resources devoted to development and poverty reduction, has been made a key parameter to be taken into account in the distribution of the EU\u2019s development aid. According to the Commission\u2019s 2003 Communication on \u2018Gov- ernance and Development\u2019, focusing on good governance also entails providing support to improvements in the management of the security sector. 47 Consequently, security sector reform \u2013 fol- lowing the terminology used by the OECD DAC, the Communica- tion speaks of \u2018security system reform\u2019 \u2013 is seen as an integral com- ponent of good governance. As the Communication notes: \u2018Effective management, transparency and accountability of the security system are necessary conditions for the creation of a secu- rity environment that upholds democratic principles and human rights. Hence working towards good governance and sustainable peace requires a successful process of reform of the security system, particularly in post-conflict environments.\u2019 48 Thus, the Commis- sion refers to both key aspects of SSR \u2013 reform of core security actors such as the military, paramilitary, police as well as their civil- ian oversight structures \u2013 and places SSR in the broader context of public sector reform. At the level of policy objectives, SSR is viewed as \u2018of fundamental importance to create safe security environ- ments and to keep the security sector permanently subject to the same governance norms as other parts of the public sector and mil- itary forces under the political control of a civilian authority.\u2019 49 In terms of concrete assistance, the Commission notes that SSR can take different forms \u2013 support for the restructuring of armed forces and intelligence services as well as justice and internal security apparatuses; controlling non-state security forces; strengthening of civil oversight mechanisms and civil management bodies; build- ing civilian capacity; demilitarising society; and supporting regional initiatives. The rationalisation of SSR in the Commission\u2019s Communica- tion on \u2018Governance and Development\u2019 draws heavily on the work 31 The European Union\u2019s approach 47. Focusing on good governance in development cooperation \u2018also entails specific support to admin- istrative reforms, improvements in the management of public fi- nances, security systems , etc.\u2019 (em- phasis added). \u2018Communication from the Commission on Gover- nance and Development\u2019, COM(2003), 615 final, Brussels, 20 October 2003, p. 31. 48.

        "2 done by the OECD DAC which, in recent years, has increasingly focussed on the linkages between security and development and the role that SSR plays in this context. 50 Consequently, the security sector governance language used in the Commission\u2019s policy docu- ment largely reflects the specific SSR-related discourse of the devel- opment community. Unfortunately, no efforts have been made to link the development discourse with the respective SSR discourses prevalent in other circles such as the security and democracy pro- motion communities, nor with the SSR-related language used in other EU policy areas such as enlargement (see above) and conflict prevention (see below). Nevertheless, the reference to SSR in the context of development and governance is so far the most elaborate conceptualisation of security sector governance to be found in EU policy documents. It is too early to assess the extent to which this has been followed by activ- ities on the ground. The recent annual reports on EU development cooperation hold that, in programming assistance, the Commis- sion has put more emphasis on governance-related aspects, includ- ing SSR. 51 Examples given for SSR-related activities in the EU\u2019s development cooperation include assistance for police reform in Kyrgyzstan and on the Solomon Islands, as well as for DDR, com- munity policing and judicial reform in Guatemala. 52 These exam- ples suggest that the mainstreaming of SSR into EC development programmes is still in its early stages. Given the difficulties EU member states have faced and are still facing in making SSR a com- ponent part of their development policy, one might assume that this will take a long time and much effort because it also requires a sea change of mentality in development cooperation. External and internal security policies In recent years, the EU\u2019s security policy has rapidly grown in scope and substance. As to internal security, a large part of JHA has been \u2018communitarised\u2019. As external security is concerned, European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) has been developed and \u2018oper- ationalised\u2019 within a relatively short period of time. 53 In December 2003, ESDP was topped by an overarching strategic concept, the European Security Strategy. Though not necessarily always explic- itly stated, the promotion of security sector governance plays an important role in both the Union\u2019s internal and external security policy. 32 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 50.

        "2 The EU and the OSCE Code of Conduct An early indication of the EU\u2019s involvement in security sector gov- ernance from a security policy perspective was its role in the elabo- ration of the OSCE Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, which was adopted in 1994. The EU was a key contrib- utor to the creation of the Code as reflected in the \u2018European Union plus\u2019 draft proposal which heavily influenced the Code\u2019s word- ing. 54 The provisions of Sections VII and VIII of the Code establish the most elaborate democratic security sector governance regime, with clear emphasis on the democratic control of armed forces (see Annexe 4). The EU proposal for the Code was one of the first proj- ects of the emerging CFSP. It indirectly competed with NATO on this project. As Victor-Yves Gh\u00e9bali notes, in the creation of the Code NATO was sidelined, which \u2018generated American unease and displeasure throughout the whole drafting process\u2019. 55 Once the politically binding document had been adopted by the OSCE member states, the EU actively promoted the Code and its provi- sions through various instruments, either through its human rights and democratisation policy or through international forums such as the United Nations Disarmament Commission. In other words, the EU has been indirectly involved in the promotion of security sector governance in the form of democratic control of armed forces for more than a decade, despite this never having been made explicit in a policy document. ESDP: European Security Strategy This has changed with the European Security Strategy, adopted in December 2003. The document is innovative in that it understands security in a comprehensive way and links security with develop- ment and democratic governance. It clearly states that \u2018security is a precondition of development\u2019, and that \u2018the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states\u2019. For that purpose, the EU should \u2018promote a ring of well governed countries to the east of the European Union and on the borders of the Mediterranean\u2019. Spreading good governance, establishing the rule of law and protecting human rights are considered \u2018the best means to strengthening international order\u2019. The document suggests that the EU should be more active in pursuing its strategic objectives and in enhancing its capacities in the area of conflict prevention and crisis management. It is in this context that the strategy paper explicitly refers to security sector governance: \u2018As we increase capa- 33 The European Union\u2019s approach 54. CSCE/FSC/SC.21 (30 June 1993).

        "2 bilities in the different areas, we should think in terms of a wider spectrum of missions. This might include joint disarmament oper- ations, support for third countries in combating terrorism and security sector reform. The last of these two would be part of broader institution building.\u2019 56 Thus, the European Security Strat- egy considers SSR to be an instrument of conflict prevention and crisis management aimed at building democratic, or at least well governed, institutions. This applies to the global context of Euro- pean security policy but has special importance for its eastern and southern neighbourhood. ESDP: conflict prevention Within the EU, the promotion of security sector governance through SSR was first conceptualised in the context of its conflict prevention strategy \u2013 half a year before the events of 11 September 2001 and two years before SSR was explicitly mentioned in the European Security Strategy and in the Communication on Gover- nance and Development. The Commission\u2019s Communication on Conflict Prevention, issued in 2001, was aimed at mainstreaming conflict prevention in the EU\u2019s external policies such as develop- ment assistance, trade, humanitarian aid, political dialogue and the new instruments in the field of crisis management. Regarding security sector governance, the Communication states: \u2018The secu- rity sector has not traditionally been a focus of Community coop- eration. However in many countries, achieving structural stability may require a fundamental overhaul of the state security sector (i.e. the police, the armed forces and democratic control of the security forces as a whole).\u2019 57 The Communication concludes that there may be a need for the Community to become more involved in secu- rity sector reform and that, within the limits of its competencies, the Commission should play an increasingly active role in the secu- rity sector area, particularly in the form of improving police serv- ices and supporting human rights training for the whole security sector. In areas such as the reform of armed forces, the Commission considers that EU member states are better placed to assist SSR activities. Furthermore, the Communication calls for the Commu- nity to become involved in SSR-related activities in post-conflict situations, such as demining operations, as well as demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants. Finally, it is suggested that the control of security forces should be addressed as a potential conflict indicator in all Country Strategy Papers. 58 34 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 56. \u2018A secure Europe in a better world\u2019, op. cit., p. 12. 57. \u2018Communication on Conflict Prevention\u2019, COM (2001), 211 final, 11 April 2001, p. 14. 58.

        "2 Though the suggestions made by the Commission have been taken up and further prioritised by the Council in the EU Pro- gramme for the Prevention of Violent Conflict (2001), European involvement in conflict prevention activities \u2013 such as SSR \u2013 has been limited in nature. 59 The annual conflict prevention reports by the Council used to refer to the efforts made in mainstreaming conflict prevention, including \u2018security sector reform and other specific post-conflict measures\u2019, 60 in Community instruments, primarily development cooperation \u2013 in a very similar way to what the annual reports on EU development cooperation do. In practice, however, there is not much SSR-related activity on the ground. In other words, the EU has yet to engage actively in promoting secu- rity sector governance in the context of conflict prevention. ESDP: crisis management The situation seems to be the inverse when it comes to civilian and military crisis management, which has been rapidly developing in recent years. On the level of declaratory policy, no reference is made to security sector governance. In practice, however, a number of tools have been created that could be used in the context of post- conflict SSR. These include the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM), Civilian Crisis Management and Military Crisis Manage- ment. The RRM, launched in 2001, is designed to enhance the EU\u2019s civilian capacity to intervene quickly and effectively in crisis situa- tions in third countries, primarily drawing on member states\u2019 civil- ian experts in areas such as mine clearance, customs and the train- ing of police or judges. The RRM can be used both to conduct one-off actions arising out of a crisis situation and to \u2018kick-start\u2019 projects or programmes aimed at specific measures to facilitate post-conflict reconstruction, such as the demobilisation and rein- tegration of combatants. However, the RRM has been designed as a short-term instrument and does not appear appropriate for most SSR activities, which tend to be long-term in nature. Civilian Crisis Management measures are being developed in four priority areas: police, rule of law, civilian administration and civil protection. In relation to police, member states have commit- ted themselves to the identification of 5,000 policemen to be made available for civilian crisis management, up to 1,400 of whom can be deployed in under 30 days. So far, the EU has fielded five civilian operations (three police, two rule of law): the EUPM in Bosnia and 35 The European Union\u2019s approach 59.

Their man- dates may differ but areas of involvement include police reform, judicial reform and integrated border management in post-con- flict settings. These ESDP missions are supplemented by the Com- mission\u2019s contribution to civilian crisis management, which is focused on local capacity-building, particularly by supporting police training and infrastructure. Military Crisis Management measures comprise military opera- tions which, as their primary mission, help to maintain a secure environment for the implementation of peace agreements. ESDP military operations have so far included: Operation Concordia in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the EU\u2019s first-ever military operation, from March to December 2003 (succeeded by EUPOL Proxima ); Operation Artemis in the DRC, launched in June and completed in September 2003; and Operation EUFOR Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the largest EU military operation so far, launched in December 2004. Thus far, these military missions have not been involved in SSR activities such as defence reform or armed forces restructuring. This, however, could easily change, as evidenced by the EU\u2019s most recent mission in the DRC: Operation EUSEC DR Congo, which was launched on 8 June 2005 for a period of 12 months and comprises a small team of experts headed by a French general. The mission\u2019s main objective is to provide advice and assistance for security sector reform in the DRC. Though not a military mission, its main task is to support the successful integra- tion of the Congolese army in line with democratic standards. In more concrete terms, the operation will assist the host government in defence reform, the restructuring of armed forces and DDR. 61 Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Security sector governance is an important issue within the domain of EU Justice and Home Affairs. The JHA policy area con- cerns issues of internal security, primarily the creation of the Schengen zone through a common border regime, the develop- ment of common asylum and immigration policies, and the har- 36 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 61.

        "2 monisation of police and judicial cooperation. Consequently, the promotion of security sector reform pertaining to border security, policing and judiciary matters falls within the JHA domain. There are three JHA areas where SSR-related activities are taking place: (a) the enlargement policy, (b) the Stabilisation and Association Process towards the Western Balkans, and (c) the external dimen- sion of the EU policy of freedom, security and justice. JHA is an important feature of the enlargement process. It forms an integral part of the political conditionality contained in the Copenhagen criteria. The third criteria refers to the ability of a candidate country to assume the obligations of membership, which essentially means implementing the acquis communautaire , and \u2018cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs\u2019 consti- tutes Chapter 26 of the acquis . Chapter 26 contains SSR-relevant activities such as assistance for border guards, police forces and the judiciary \u2013 of course, without referring to them as being part of SSR or even security sector governance promotion. Together with economic development, JHA represents the most important sector of assistance to the Western Balkans. The SAP is the overriding framework for EU relations with the countries of the Western Balkans. Within this process, the strategy for supporting JHA issues is based on four priority areas: (1) police, public order and organised crime, (2) integrated border management, (3) judi- cial reform, and (4) asylum and migration. In the case of the SAP countries, the development of integrated border management sys- tems throughout the region takes the lion\u2019s share of EU assistance in the field of SSR. Finally, the JHA policy area has an external dimension which goes beyond the enlargement, stabilisation and association process. In \u2018The Hague Programme\u2019, the new JHA multi-annual programme adopted in November 2004, the European Council considers the development of a coherent external dimension of the Union policy of freedom, security and justice as a \u2018growing prior- ity\u2019. Apart from the candidate and SAP countries, the JHA compo- nent of external relations focuses primarily on the EU\u2019s eastern and southern neighbourhood, and it covers a broad range of themes such as the rule of law, border management, migration, law enforcement, the judiciary, and the fight against terrorism and organised crime, including trafficking in human beings. 37 The European Union\u2019s approach cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 37 ",
        "2 A wide range of SSR-related activities This section provides a tentative profile of the EU\u2019s recent activities in the field of security sector governance and reform, based on the conceptual framework presented in the previous chapter. Accord- ingly, three broad categories can be distinguished: restructuring security institutions, strengthening control mechanisms and reconstructing the security sector after conflict. As the following discussion shows, the EU has been active in all three SSR dimen- sions with a strong emphasis on restructuring (non-military) secu- rity institutions while showing a marked reserve in the governance dimension. Restructuring security institutions Looking at SSR-related activities pursued by the EU, reform meas- ures aimed at the defence sector are still very much the exception. Though the principle of civilian control of armed forces has been made a political requirement in the accession as well as the stabili- sation and association processes, this has not been followed by activities on the ground. Defence-related SSR activities such as human rights training for military personnel (in Ukraine, for example) or awareness raising activities aimed at the military and civilians have been funded under the EIDHR programme in the past. A certain reluctance to engage in military-related reform activities can be understood from the Commission\u2019s Communica- tion on Conflict Prevention, which suggests that the EU member states are better placed to assist in the reform of the armed forces than the EU itself. In the past, ESDP operations have not been involved in defence and armed forces reform activities. But this is about to change, as evidenced by the recently launched EUSEC DR Congo (see above). Human rights education is also an important component of the EU\u2019s police related SSR activities. However, the EU activities in this SSR sub-sector go far beyond human rights training. They include support for police training, police restructuring and improvement of police infrastructure. These support programmes are conducted in the framework of the EU\u2019s conflict prevention and civilian crisis management policies as well as the external component of JHA. In its eastern and southern neighbourhood, the EU concentrates its police reform activities on the southern Mediterranean (Algeria, 38 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 38 ",
        "2 and the Palestinian Authority) and the SAP countries in the West- ern Balkans. In the case of the latter, this is accentuated by the fact that CIVPOL missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYROM are heavily engaged in supporting the restructuring of local police forces. A similar situation can be found in the area of judicial reform . In addition to human rights education, EU programmes include sup- port for judicial reform measures, technical capacity building such as the improvement of court facilities and the training of judges, lawyers, and court and prison staff. These activities are usually implemented through EIDHR funding or in the framework of JHA external relations programmes. Judicial reforms are promoted throughout the EU\u2019s eastern and southern neighbourhood. They often constitute the most substantive SSR-related activities assisted by the EU in less reform-prone countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan and the southern Mediterranean countries. It is worth noting that judicial reform is becoming an important dimension in post-conflict missions, as shown by the civilian ESDP operations EUJUST Themis (Georgia) and EUJUST LEX (Iraq). Border security seems to account for the lion\u2019s share of the SSR activities aimed at building, strengthening and reforming security sector institutions. Border security related SSR activities cover var- ious integrated border management (IBM) programmes with geo- graphical emphasis on the Western Balkans and some \u2018new\u2019 eastern neighbours (particularly Ukraine and Georgia). These pro- grammes include professional training, legal assistance, capacity building and technical support of border guards. EU assisted bor- der security activities are generally conducted as part of the external dimension of JHA, and also exceptionally in the framework of CIVPOL missions (e.g. EUPOL Proxima in FYROM). Strengthening control mechanisms EU activities in the field of civilian oversight and democratic accountability such as assistance for governmental bodies, parlia- mentarians and civil society actors (e.g. NGOs, media) are numer- ous, particularly under the heading of EIDHR, but are rarely directed at strengthening governance of the security sector proper. In areas which are relevant to the democratic governance of inter- nal security, certain governance aspects are being addressed by the EU\u2019s programmes and projects in support of candidate, partner 39 The European Union\u2019s approach cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 39 ",
        "2 and other neighbouring countries, particularly with regard to the creation of an independent and professional judiciary, promotion of human rights standards and training of law enforcement offi- cers. Yet only a few programmes have a direct bearing on the over- sight dimension of SSR, such as assistance in drafting laws and in military budgeting, support for the creation of civilian and military ombudsmen, and educational programmes on transparency and accountability of security forces for parliamentarians and journal- ists. The Commission\u2019s Communication on Governance and Development refers to the importance of political control and oversight of the security sector. Among the SSR interventions rec- ommended by the Communication are the strengthening of civil oversight mechanisms and civil management bodies as well as building civilian capacity. It remains to be seen, however, to what extent this is translated into the practice of development coopera- tion where, thus far, the governance dimension of SSR appears to have been confined to policy statements rather than being applied in operational projects. SSR activities conducted under JHA as well as those pursued under ESDP, namely conflict prevention and crisis management, almost exclusively focus on the restructuring of security institu- tions such as police forces and border guards, rather than on the strengthening of their democratic accountability. Of course, some would argue in favour of improving governance \u2018by osmosis\u2019, i.e. by making the security institutions more efficient, effective and pro- fessional according to EU standards, their democratic governance would automatically be improved or, at least, facilitated. In prac- tice, however, EU-assisted SSR is primarily motivated by strength- ening its external borders and the law enforcement capacities of neighbouring countries in order to prevent illegal migration, traf- ficking, organised crime and terrorism, rather than by its explicitly or implicitly stated policy of improving the democratic governance of the security sector in these countries. Reconstructing the security sector What makes SSR in post-conflict situations different from SSR in other contexts is the fact that it has to deal with the specific legacy of past conflict. This may include oversized armed forces, both statutory and non-statutory, which need to be downsized, surplus weapons that need to be disposed of, anti-personnel landmines 40 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 40 ",
        "2 that need to be cleared, and large numbers of criminals that need to be prosecuted. Consequently, the 2001 Communication of the Commission on Conflict Prevention calls for the EU to become involved in SSR-related activities in post-conflict settings, such as demining operations and DDR. 62 The 2003 Communication on Governance and Development holds that \u2018working towards good governance and sustainable peace requires a successful process of reform of the security system, particularly in post-conflict environ- ments\u2019. 63 It therefore does not come as a surprise that the EU\u2019s SSR- related activities in post-conflict contexts tend to focus on DDR of former combatants including child soldiers, curbing the prolifera- tion of SALW, clearance of anti-personnel landmines, and judicial capacity-building to permit transitional justice, etc. These activi- ties are primarily carried out in the context of development cooper- ation, conflict prevention and crisis management. Within the European neighbourhood, post-conflict-specific SSR assistance concentrates on the Western Balkans and to a lesser degree also on the Southern Caucasus. Conclusion At the declaratory level, the EU has recognised the role that security sector governance and reform are increasingly playing in its exter- nal policies. Security sector governance language, explicit or implicit, can be found in a number of policy documents \u2013 most obviously in those concerning development cooperation and con- flict prevention. The references to security sector governance, how- ever, appear to be isolated from one another, reflecting different policy discourses each linked to another epistemic community: security policy, development cooperation and, to a lesser extent, the promotion of democracy. Policies aimed at promoting security sector governance can be found in three aspects of the EU\u2019s institu- tional structure: the Community\u2019s external relations, ESDP, and JHA. They cover a wide range of policy areas such as human rights and democratisation, development cooperation, conflict preven- tion and crisis management as well as the external dimension of the EU\u2019s internal security governance. What is lacking, however, is a comprehensive and coherent strategy on the promotion of security sector governance within the broader framework of EU external relations. The EU can hardly be blamed for this given the fact that 41 The European Union\u2019s approach 62. COM (2001), 211 final, 11 April 2001, p. 15. 63.

        "2 concepts of security sector governance and reform are still fairly recent, and that most of the EU member states either do not have a security sector governance policy or are struggling with establish- ing and implementing \u2018joined-up\u2019 government approaches in this field. In practice, the EU has been involved in the promotion of secu- rity sector governance for quite some time, though without neces- sarily attributing these activities to the SSR concept. In recent years, SSR-relevant activities have increased both in number and in scope. There is a clear bias in favour of building efficient and effec- tive security institutions, border guards and police forces in partic- ular, whereas activities aimed at the strengthening of oversight capacities appear to be few in number and limited in scope. Activi- ties supporting the reform of security institutions tend to focus on non-military/internal security providers, whereas assistance to armed forces and intelligence services and the politico-military dimension of security seem to be almost absent. Activities aimed at strengthening oversight mechanisms are so few in number that no conclusive statement can be made except that support for parlia- mentary capacity-building and civil society empowerment is usu- ally general in nature and not geared to the security sector. In short, there is an increasing degree of appreciation within the EU that security sector governance matters in security policy, devel- opment cooperation and the promotion of democracy. However, there is no overarching conceptual framework that could guide programmes and projects aimed at improving security sector gov- ernance in third countries. 42 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 42 ",
        "The eastern neighbours The eastern neighbourhood of the EU ranges from Croatia to Rus- sia, and from Albania to the south Caucasus. It comprises the South-East European countries as well as the EU\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 eastern neighbours covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). While the countries of the former group are all eligible for EU membership provided they meet the requirements, those of the latter group do not have such prospects, which in the case of Cen- tral and Eastern Europe have proven to be decisive for successful political and economic reforms, including in the security sector. South-Eastern Europe is probably the most exciting laboratory of externally assisted security sector reform. What all states in the region have in common, albeit to differing degrees, is the ambition to accede to, or at least closely associate themselves with, the key security providers and exporters in Europe: NATO and the EU. Through their accession to NATO, Bulgaria and Romania have already passed the threshold of democratic governance of the security sector though, in view of EU membership, further progress is required in the area of internal security. Most of the post-conflict West Balkan countries are still lagging far behind with reforming their security sectors. NATO and increasingly so the EU hold considerable leverage over the Western Balkans given their dominant presence in international peace-building missions in the region and, even more importantly, the \u2018carrot\u2019 of eventual membership which they both have to offer. As shown in the case of the Central and East European countries, the focus of NATO\u2019s SSR assistance is on defence reform and the strengthening of dem- ocratic control of armed forces. The EU, in turn, is concentrating its efforts on areas which are relevant for its JHA acquis such as bor- der security and policing. Despite all the difficulties encountered, the high level of commitment demonstrated by the EU and NATO, and the functioning division of labour between the two, has resulted in security sector governance in the Western Balkans being improved. 43 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 3 cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 43 ",
        "3 Promoting security sector governance is even more challenging in the post-Soviet part of the EU neighbourhood \u2013 the \u2018new\u2019 eastern neighbourhood, in which post-authoritarian and, in the case of the south Caucasus, post-conflict legacies pose significant obstacles to democratic transition. Although Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and the three south Caucasian states are all members of the NATO PfP programme and have entered into Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCA) with the EU, the option of full membership of NATO and/or the EU is not available to any of these countries, or at least not for the time being. Thus, the willingness of these \u2018new\u2019 neighbours to undergo democratic reforms in general and security sector reform in particular is limited, except for Geor- gia and Ukraine whose recent peaceful transitions of power have opened new windows of opportunity for democratisation, includ- ing with respect to the security sector. Given the geographical dis- tance and the special role that Russia still plays in this part of the EU\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 neighbourhood (which Russia considers to be its \u2018near abroad\u2019), external SSR assistance to the westernmost NIS and the south Caucasus has been rather limited and incremental. Division of labour with NATO in South-Eastern Europe South-Eastern Europe comprises, inter alia , two NATO member states (Bulgaria, Romania), three NATO candidate states (Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), three EU candidate countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania) and two post-conflict entities under international auspices (Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo). In Bosnia and Herzegovina, responsi- bility for stabilisation and security was taken over from NATO by the EU in December 2004, whereas in Kosovo the EU contributes to stabilisation and peace building together with NATO, the UN and the OSCE. Given the diversity of the region in terms of security, governance and development (for indicators see Annexe 2), it is dif- ficult to adopt a common approach in dealing with these chal- lenges. In discussing security sector governance, we will follow established EU practice and subdivide South-Eastern Europe into two groups: the more advanced east Balkan countries, Bulgaria and Romania, on the one hand, and the post-conflict countries in the Western Balkans on the other (whilst acknowledging that Croatia plays a special role in the latter group). 44 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-text.qxp 02/08/2005 14:47 Page 44 ",
        "3 Bulgaria and Romania: traditional division of labour Bulgaria and Romania are considered to be in the vanguard of secu- rity sector reform in South-Eastern Europe. 64 This may be true for the defence sector but much less so for internal security. Bulgaria\u2019s, and even more so Romania\u2019s military have been transformed beyond recognition over the past decade, whereas reforms in the internal security domain have lagged behind. This difference of reform achievements within the security sectors of both countries can be explained by the fact that the promotion of security sector governance in post-communist Europe, with the emphasis on defence reform and democratic civilian control of armed forces, became one of NATO\u2019s central goals in the 1990s. NATO was the first and the most active and influential provider of external assis- tance in security sector reform. 65 The main tools were the PfP pro- gramme, launched in 1994, and since 1999 the MAP for candidate countries of the second enlargement round. Contrary to other South-East European states, Bulgaria and Romania have both been fully involved in these processes since their inception and have benefited from NATO assistance in establishing democratic gover- nance and reforming their defence apparatus. Their accession to NATO in March 2004 is proof of this progress in recent years, which suggests that both Bulgaria and Romania have passed the key threshold of consolidating democratic governance of the defence sector \u2013 although as some would argue NATO\u2019s leverage over security sector governance in these states may decline after their accession to the EU. 66 The EU still holds considerable leverage over Bulgaria and Romania, as both countries are part of its enlargement process which was launched in 1997 (candidate status since 1999) and will probably come to a conclusion with their accession to the Union in 2007. However, the EU\u2019s push for reforms pertaining to the security sector is confined to the JHA chapter of the acquis communautaire . No reference to security sector governance is made under the polit- ical criteria for membership, which, in the case of the West Balkans countries and Turkey, includes the strengthening of civilian con- trol of the military. Both Bulgaria and Romania continue to suffer from deficien- cies in the areas of judicial reform and border management. This reflects the EU\u2019s primary concern with strengthening its external borders and combating illegal immigration and organised crime. Consequently, the pre-accession financial assistance that Bulgaria 45 The eastern neighbours 64.

The 2004 regular reports on progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in fulfilling accession criteria point to judicial reform and border management as two such areas where further improve- ments need to be made. As to Bulgaria, the report called for further reforms in the structure of the judiciary and the police, and for a more proactive attitude regarding border controls, although progress was noted regarding the performance of border police. 67 With respect to Romania, the report stressed the need for a contin- uation of judicial reforms, the establishment of an integrated bor- der management system and measures aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the border police as well as its demilitarisation and its capacity for inter-agency cooperation. 68 In sum, Bulgaria and Romania represent a good example of the traditional division of labour between NATO and the EU, with the former promoting security sector governance in the traditional field of the military and defence institutions and the latter concen- trating on the reform of non-military structures of the security sec- tor such as border guards, police, and the judiciary. Post-conflict challenges to SSR in the Western Balkans Compared with Bulgaria and Romania, the West Balkans coun- tries are not only faced with the challenges of post-communist democratisation but also find themselves struggling with the fallout of a decade of deadly violence and the transition from planned to market economies at a comparatively low level of development. Thus, security sector reform in this subregion is taking place in a setting which combines the difficulties of all three contexts discussed above: post-authoritarian, post-conflict and to a certain degree even developmental. The security sectors of the West Balkan countries have been portrayed as being \u2018frag- mented, underdeveloped (although some sectors, typically the armed forces, are over-developed for peacetime conditions), over- politicized and structured along ethnic or religious lines\u2019. 69 Moreover, the task of security sector reform is greatly aggravated and complicated by the presence of armed non-state actors rang- ing from paramilitary organisations and private military compa- nies to criminal groups and guerrilla movements. Security sector governance is further undermined by the lack of civilian expertise 46 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 67. \u20182004 Regular Report on Bul- garia\u2019s progress towards acces- sion\u2019, SEC(2004)1199, pp. 17- 19, 27, 117, 120, 140. 68. \u20182004 Regular Report on Ro- mania\u2019s progress towards acces- sion\u2019, SEC(2004)1200, pp. 19-21, 31, 123-4, 127, 129-130. 69.

        "3 in government and parliament, and by the weakness of civil soci- ety, particularly in the security domain. Throughout most of its existence, the authoritarian regime of former Yugoslavia relied on the support of the armed and special police forces. This tradition was continued in the 1990s, when under the Tudjman and Milosevic regimes in Croatia and Serbia respectively the militaries and intelligence services continued to exercise exclusive control over defence planning and policy. After the death of Tudjman and the overthrow of Milosevic, the new gov- ernments began to engage in democratising security sector gover- nance. The process was slow and suffered setbacks in the case of Serbia and Montenegro, which still has to reach a national consen- sus on its foreign and security policy and its role in the Euro- Atlantic community. SSR in Serbia and Montenegro has largely been limited to the revision of key legislation and the adoption of strategic documents. The lack of cooperation with the Interna- tional Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains the main obstacle to external assistance for reform including SSR, although this holds true for other West Balkan states, too. Croatia on the other hand, after having embraced the goal of NATO mem- bership, successfully embarked on the course of institutional reform of the defence structures, although the actual practice of democratic governance is still lagging behind. As an active partici- pant in PfP and an aspirant to NATO membership, the country is benefiting from considerable external assistance in defence reform. The same could be said of Albania, which despite its deficits in overall democratic governance, has progressed in reforming its security sector, particularly in the defence area. With the active assistance of both NATO and allies such as the United States, Alba- nia\u2019s military reforms have in many ways been \u2018the bright spot on the country\u2019s reform agenda over the past ten years\u2019 \u2013 though its record is somewhat less exemplary on questions of democratic oversight. 70 Being the third NATO aspirant in the Western Balkans, the FYROM faces the specific challenges of reforming the security structures in a post-conflict environment, even with pre- conflict features in this case given the continuing tensions between the ethnic groups and the lingering Kosovo issue which is related to these tensions. Yet, FYROM\u2019s efforts to strengthen democratic gov- ernance and to reform its security sector should be facilitated by the considerable international resources which are still being 47 The eastern neighbours 70.

        "3 devoted to the country\u2019s stabilisation process \u2013 including assis- tance by NATO on defence reform, by the OSCE on police reform and by the EU on border security. Bosnia and Herzegovina, another \u2013 even more problematic \u2013 case of post-conflict stabilisation in the region, faces additional challenges of security sector governance. The post-Dayton exis- tence of ethnically based, parallel security institutions and in fact three separate armed forces has been a heavy burden on public finances, which in turn has given the international community new leverage for insisting on reform. Indeed, the \u2018carrot\u2019 of prospec- tive PfP membership has greatly facilitated the downsizing of armed forces and defence reform assisted by NATO, whereas police reform has been predominantly driven by successive international police missions, particularly the EUPM. 71 Despite this, the dependence on pressures of the international community and the lack of local ownership make the sustainability of security sector reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina questionable. The same holds true for Kosovo, an international protectorate whose unresolved legal status is a major source of crisis and instability in the region and whose security sector is characterized by an uneasy reliance on both international military and police missions and also local aux- iliary forces largely made up of former guerrilla combatants. 72 NATO and EU as key players in external assistance to SSR External assistance to security sector reform has always been part of approaches by the West to the region in the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s \u2013 ranging from crisis management and post-conflict stabilisation to partnership, association and more recently even pre-accession programmes. Not surprisingly, NATO and the EU have been, and still are, the key actors in this regard. NATO plays the leading role in providing assistance for defence reform, civilian management and democratic control of armed forces. Having officially applied for accession to NATO, Albania, Croatia and FYROM are fully integrated in the MAP activities which are aimed at bringing the defence sector of the candidate countries up to NATO standards, including in terms of democratic governance. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, through the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR), the Alliance has been active in downsizing armed forces and retraining and reintegrating demobilised military personnel. Following the handover to 48 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 71.

        "3 EUFOR\u2019s military Operation Althea at the end of 2004, NATO will now focus primarily on defence reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina, preparing the country initially for membership of the PfP and even- tually of the Alliance itself. Serbia and Montenegro \u2013 the target of a sustained NATO air campaign just six years ago \u2013 has become a can- didate for the NATO PfP programme. The Western Balkans are gradually becoming part of the EU\u2019s own orbit, with Croatia being the first West Balkan country to have been admitted as a candidate for EU membership, in 2003. In the 1990s, the EU\u2019s involvement in the region focused on crisis man- agement, humanitarian relief and reconstruction, reflecting the countries\u2019 most critical needs at that time. However, as the region emerged from this immediate post-crisis period, the EU shifted towards a longer-term approach to the Western Balkans, in the form of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP), which was launched in 1999. In two cases, Croatia and FYROM, Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA) have been signed to underpin the process. The EU has incorporated a number of commitments into these agreements which pertain to the JHA dimension of secu- rity sector governance, particularly the need for judicial reform. The CARDS assistance programme that was launched in 2001 serves as the EU\u2019s main instrument in supporting the West Balkan countries in the SAP. This programme includes a number of activi- ties in the field of police reform and particularly border security (see below). In the framework of its evolving ESDP operations, the EU is increasingly becoming involved in peacekeeping (EUFOR Althea , Concordia ) and police restructuring (EUPM, EUPOL) in the region\u2019s post-conflict states, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYROM. With the EU taking the lead in internal and border security issues, and NATO in defence affairs, the two organisations appear to be operating a division of labour in promoting security sector governance which \u2013 although at the time not a deliberate policy \u2013 has already proven quite successful in Central and Eastern Europe as well as Bulgaria and Romania (see above). Given their crucial and largely complementary role in stabilising the Western Balkans, both organisations have agreed to develop \u2018a framework for an enhanced dialogue and a concerted approach to supporting secu- rity and stability in the Western Balkans\u2019. 73 Coordination between the EU and NATO in promoting security sector governance has indeed proven to be workable in the Western Balkans. This has 49 The eastern neighbours 73. \u2018NAC Final Communiqu\u00e9\u2019, Brussels, 12 June 2003. cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 49 ",
        "3 been underlined by the handover of command arrangements from NATO to the EU under the \u2018Berlin-plus\u2019 formula, first in FYROM (from Operation Allied Harmony to Concordia ) and more recently in Bosnia and Herzegovina (from SFOR to EUFOR Althea ). Another case in point is the NATO-initiated Ohrid Border Process (see below). 74 Apart from NATO and the EU, a wide range of multilateral, bilateral and transnational actors have been involved in the pro- motion of security sector governance in the region. The Council of Europe\u2019s promotion of its Code of Police Ethics among its mem- ber states falls into this category, as does the OSCE\u2019s assistance to the parliamentary defence committees in Bosnia and Herzegov- ina. As an inventory drawn up on behalf of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe indicates, there has been an abundance of externally assisted SSR activities throughout the region \u2013 in addi- tion to the measures undertaken by the EU and NATO. This con- siderable international attention to security sector governance in the Western Balkans is, however, undermined by the lack of coor- dination among external actors, especially within individual tar- get states. 75 The EU-initiated Stability Pact, which makes \u2018democratisation and non-discrimination fundamental preconditions to guarantee- ing internal and external security\u2019, has attempted to address this widely recognised deficiency by establishing a kind of a clearing house for joint regional action, bringing together both the relevant international actors engaged in the region and the regional states proper. The Pact\u2019s Working Table III covers security sector gover- nance issues ranging from JHA to defence conversion, with SSR and border security being considered as \u2018cross-sub-table issues\u2019. 76 A number of regional SSR-related initiatives have been launched within this framework, such as the Regional Arms Control Verifi- cation and Implementation Assistance Centre (RACVIAC), the South Eastern Europe Clearing House for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC), the Initiative against Orga- nized Crime (SPOC) or the Migration, Asylum, Refugees Regional Initiative (MARRI), which also covers border management issues. Some of them have yielded significant results. Other initiatives, however, have been criticised for lacking sustainability and pro- ducing little added value. 50 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 74.

        "3 The EU: border security, police \u2013 and armed forces In the Western Balkans, the EU has a comparatively strong influ- ence on the shaping of security sector governance. It is the key exter- nal player in reforms in the area of JHA, and particularly those con- cerning policing and border security. The latter has become a first priority of its technical assistance channelled to the Western Balkans through the regional CARDS programme. Police reforms are also being pursued in the framework of post-conflict EUPOL missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in FYROM. Finally, it is noteworthy that, in the case of the Western Balkans, civilian con- trol of the military, traditionally the domain of NATO, has been made a political condition in the stabilisation and association process. 77 Border security . The prevention of illegal migration and cross-border crime from and through the Balkans has become a major concern for the EU (the so-called \u2018Balkan route\u2019 is a major corridor for traf- ficking in human beings, drugs and other illicit goods into the EU). As a consequence, great \u2013 and, some would argue, disproportionate \u2013 emphasis has been placed on the establishment of effective bor- der security systems in the region. The EU\u2019s approach to promoting border security in the region is embedded in the NATO-initiated Ohrid Border Process. Launched in 2003, the Ohrid process consti- tutes a concerted effort by the EU, NATO, the OSCE, the Stability Pact and the West Balkan countries to establish \u2018integrated border management\u2019 (IBM) 78 systems in a regional framework. Through the instrument of the CARDS Regional Programme, the EU has made the development of IBM systems one of four priority areas for support in the stabilisation and accession process. A total of \u20ac 117 million\u2013 almost two-thirds of the CARDS regional budget in 2002- 04 \u2013 has been attributed to IBM development alone. 79 EU assis- tance for border security in the Western Balkans takes the opera- tional form of providing policy advice and equipment, upgrading infrastructure and promoting training. In Bosnia and Herzegov- ina, for example, a priority area has been the creation of the State Border Service (SBS). In FYROM, the focus is on demilitarising border guarding by creating a professional border police and trans- ferring the responsibility from the defence to the interior ministry. Overall, the annual stabilisation and association reports on the West Balkan countries indicate huge deficiencies in regional bor- der guarding and rather slow progress in developing an IBM (inte- 51 The eastern neighbours 77.

The most important EU police reform projects in the West- ern Balkans have been those carried out in the framework of EUPM in Bosnia and EUPOL Proxima in FYROM. One could also mention the EU\u2019s assistance for the Kosovo Police Force under UNMIK\u2019s supervision and the Multinational Advisory Police Element (MAPE), which was carried out under the auspices of the WEU in Albania after the crisis in 1997. What these operations have in com- mon is that they were, and in some cases still are, part of post-con- flict reconstruction efforts under international auspices. In FYROM police restructuring became an important \u2013 externally induced \u2013 measure in achieving proportional representation among the country\u2019s ethnic communities within security sector institutions. 80 Apart from this, the EU has been supporting police reforms in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro in the framework of the CARDS programme. The main objective of these reform activities has been to depoliticise, rebuild and transform the numerous police forces, whose main mission should be to safeguard the rights of the citizens, and which operate according to democratic standards and the principles of \u2018community policing\u2019. As to democratic standards, EU documents refer to the Council of Europe\u2019s Code of Police Ethics. In addition, a core focus of police reform assistance has also been to train police forces in the fight against organised and transnational crime, phe- nomena which were largely absent in the region prior to the 1990s. The EU\u2019s assistance for police reform in West Balkan states consists of support for institution-building and policy development as well as the provision of training and equipment. Armed forces and intelligence . Unlike in Bulgaria and Romania, the EU takes more interest in the defence and military dimension of secu- rity sector governance with respect to the West Balkan countries (see above). In its annual stabilisation and association reports, armed forces have been included in the assessment of democratic institutions. It is worth mentioning that this is done in a more com- prehensive way than in the case of Turkey (see Chapter 4). These reports comprise a number of demands pertaining to the defence sector, including the strengthening of civilian control of the armed 52 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 80.

Finally, reference is made to the efforts undertaken by the SAP countries in acceding to NATO or PfP. 81 This would sug- gest that the requirement of democratic governance of the defence sector has become an integral part of the political criteria for EU accession and eventual membership. In the case of the Western Balkans, EU conditionality takes a comparatively comprehensive approach to security sector governance by covering both military and non-military aspects. This does not necessarily mean that the EU is stumbling into NATO\u2019s domain of promoting democratic governance of the defence sector. Thus far at least, political condi- tionality with respect to defence reform has been confined to the setting of membership requirements but has not been followed by policy advice or technical assistance in this field. A cautious approach towards the \u2018new\u2019 eastern neigh- bours While for South-Eastern Europe, the \u2018European perspective offers both a strategic objective and an incentive for reform\u2019, 82 the absence of such a perspective complicates the prospects for pro- moting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 eastern neigh- bourhood. This part of the EU\u2019s neighbourhood, ranging from Belarus to the south Caucasus, is marked by a degree of diversity which makes it difficult to treat it as one strategic entity. What these countries \u2013 all former Soviet republics \u2013 have in common is that they are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); that they all collaborate with NATO in the framework of its PfP programme (Russia and Ukraine having a special sta- tus); 83 and that relations between them and the EU have evolved on the basis of PCA and the TACIS programme of EU assistance (although Russia and Ukraine have developed special relations with the EU). 84 As regards reform-mindedness of the NIS governments, the pic- ture is rather bleak with the exception of Georgia and Ukraine, which, in the aftermath of recent peaceful regime change, have both fully embraced the concept of Western integration and 53 The eastern neighbours 81.

        "3 embarked on an ambitious reform programme. At the other end of the spectrum are countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova, whose more or less authoritarian regimes follow, each for their own specific reasons, the course of long-term integration into NATO and/or EU but fall far short of meeting even basic political require- ments. There is also the peculiar case of Belarus, which does not aspire to integrate into Western institutions, certainly not on the conditions of democratic governance. Finally, Russia is a nuclear armed former superpower which expects to be dealt with on special terms rather than being submerged in broad partnership pro- grammes or neighbourhood policies, and which might be wary of Western institutions trying to meddle in the delicate and complex transformation of its security institutions. In discussing security sector governance, it is useful to subdi- vide the \u2018new\u2019 eastern neighbourhood into two groups: the Western NIS, comprising Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and Russia, on the one hand, and the three states of the south Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) on the other. Focus on judiciary and border security in the Western NIS and Russia The Western NIS and Russia form a typical example of security sec- tor reform taking place, if it does at all, in a post-authoritarian con- text. Post-communist legacies such as continued authoritarian leadership, nepotism, corruption, and overblown and unaccount- able segments of the security apparatus make SSR a daunting task, even more so given the absence of any significant leverage of NATO and the EU. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova are all formal partners of NATO (through PfP membership) and of the EU (through the conclusion of PCA and participation in the TACIS programme), with certain restrictions in the case of Belarus. As such they are exposed to, and may benefit from, a broad range of activities aimed at promoting governance and reform of the secu- rity sector The focus of NATO\u2019s activities in these countries is on civilian control and defence reform issues, reflecting the priorities set by the Partnership Work Programme. NATO was particularly active in supporting SSR in Ukraine even long before the \u2018Orange Revo- lution\u2019 of late 2004. Clearly, defence reform is the main priority of the NATO-Ukraine partnership, but it is carried out in the broader 54 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 54 ",
        "3 SSR context and with a strong governance dimension. Support for the transformation of the armed forces and the defence establish- ment is complemented by assistance in the areas of border security and inter-agency cooperation. Measures aimed at \u2018strengthening civilian and democratic control over the armed forces and the whole security sector\u2019, with emphasis on parliamentary oversight and participation of civilians in decision-making related to secu- rity issues, are an integral part of the cooperation package. 85 In the case of Russia, security sector governance is conspicuously absent from the joint cooperation agenda, except for certain aspects of defence reform which are of a fairly technical nature and void of any governance dimension. Major activities in this field include a dialogue on defence reform within the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) and a project for the retraining of retired Russian military personnel. 86 This narrow focus reflects the problematic nature of security sector governance in Russia under the Putin presidency and suggests that SSR related issues will, for the foreseeable future, remain at the margins of NATO-Russia cooperation. The EU concentrates its assistance to the Western NIS and Rus- sia on the JHA related aspects of security sector governance such as judiciary, policing and border management. Its relations with Rus- sia and Ukraine are both guided by a common CFSP strategy, adopted in 1999, which sets out the general framework of coopera- tion. In the case of Russia, it notes the EU\u2019s wish to support the country in the reform and strengthening of its judicial bodies and police, in accordance with democratic standards. 87 In terms of practical cooperation, the EU concentrates on supporting the judi- cial reform initiated by President Putin by providing training and retraining for judges and their supporting staff. Cooperation on border security issues has so far remained on the level of declara- tions of intent. 88 In the case of Ukraine, the strategy paper states that \u2018the EU will put increased emphasis on border management issues\u2019. 89 Indeed, apart from assistance in judicial reform, the EU concentrates its SSR activities on support for Ukraine\u2019s efforts in strengthening its overall border management system. This includes capacity build- ing, the provision of technical assistance and relevant training as well as supply of modern equipment for border guards and cus- toms officials. 90 It is noteworthy that in the late 1990s the EU, in the framework of EIDHR, had been involved in human rights train- ing for Ukrainian armed forces, thereby reaching out, albeit mar- 55 The eastern neighbours 85.

        "3 ginally, to the defence sector (see Chapter 2). It remains to be seen whether the peaceful transfer of power in Kyiv in late 2004 broad- ens the scope for EU assistance for SSR in the Ukraine beyond the narrow confines of integrated border management. Yet, neither the EU-Ukraine Action Plan of December 2004 nor the measures agreed in February 2005 in order to enrich the Action Plan contain any references to security sector governance. 91 Not surprisingly, Russia \u2013 a \u2018strategic partner\u2019 \u2013 and Ukraine \u2013 a \u2018first priority partner\u2019 in the ENP framework \u2013 tend to dominate the agenda of EU relations with the region. Belarus and Moldova risk being sidelined in the EU\u2019s overall engagement with the region, for obvious reasons in the case of Belarus, and for less obvious ones in the case of Moldova given the latter\u2019s strong European integra- tion aspirations (although one has to recognise that, as a member of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, Moldova enjoys alternative options for engaging with the EU and its member states). Just as the other NIS, Belarus and Moldova continue to ben- efit from the TACIS Cross-Border Cooperation programme, which in contrast to the previous state of affairs now seems to comprise SSR-related border management activities, including the estab- lishment of an IBM system in Belarus. 92 All this seems to indicate that border security concerns, rather than concerns about a lack of democratic governance, are the driving factor for EU assisted SSR activities in authoritarian neighbouring countries. An EU \u2018non-strategy\u2019 towards the south Caucasus? The promotion of security sector governance in the south Cauca- sus (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) takes place in an environ- ment which is even more complex than the one just discussed. Only Georgia, since the \u2018Rose Revolution\u2019 of November 2003, is really a post-authoritarian state engaged in democratic reforms, whereas both Armenia and Azerbaijan can still be characterised as illiberal democracies at best. All three countries are post-conflict but given the frozen yet unresolved internal (Georgia) and interstate (Arme- nia, Azerbaijan) conflicts, they could also be characterised as pre- conflict. In socio-economic terms, the south Caucasus appears to be composed of developing rather than transitional countries. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia suffer from serious deficits in security, democracy and development, as has been recently noted in the country assessments drawn up by the European Commis- 56 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 91.

        "3 sion. 93 Against this background, the challenges for any meaningful SSR programme in these countries are considerable. Yet, in view of closer integration with the Euro-Atlantic com- munity and strongly encouraged by the United Stats in the context of its post-9/11 engagement in the region, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have embarked on SSR programmes which are supported by NATO in the PfP framework. The Partnership Action Plan on Defence Institution Building (PAP-DIB), launched in 2004, was designed particularly for the purpose of assisting the three south Caucasian states (as well as the five Central Asian republics) in their SSR efforts. PAP-DIB is intended to provide a common platform for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in developing (and sus- taining) \u2018efficient and democratically responsible defence institu- tions including the armed forces under democratic and civilian control\u2019. 94 Apart from defence institution building, NATO intends to \u2018facilitate\u2019 SSR \u2018in other areas where it does not have a primary responsibility, such as border security\u2019. 95 Border security has been made a priority issue in the Partnership Action Plan against terror- ism, in which context the Ohrid Border Process is viewed as a model for other regions such as the Caucasus. 96 While NATO plays a key role in promoting norms and practices of democratic governance of defence structures, the EU has thus far been only marginally engaged in SSR activities in the region. This is not so much specific to SSR activities: there seems to have been a general lack of EU engagement with the south Caucasian coun- tries, which is much resented by the pro-European reformists in the region, but may not be a bad policy given the comparatively low importance of the south Caucasus for the EU, the limited leverage of the EU over these countries and the unmatched US presence in the region. 97 The EU\u2019s benign neglect of the countries in the south Caucasus has been manifested by the emergence of the new neigh- bourhood initiative which initially excluded Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, only to have them included at a later stage as the pol- icy further developed. In practice, the EU\u2019s relations with the south Caucasus has followed the rationale of its overall approach to the former Soviet area, based on the conclusion of fairly technical PCA in the late 1990s and the provision of assistance through the TACIS programme. The only TACIS projects relevant to security sector governance at large are measures aimed at judicial reform. Also, judicial reform is mentioned as the only SSR key objective for the future ENP Action Plans on Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. 57 The eastern neighbours 93.

        "3 In this context, Georgia has recently become a focal point for EU civilian crisis management in the framework of ESDP. In the after- math of the November 2003 \u2018Rose revolution\u2019, the EU swiftly increased its assistance to Georgia including in areas related to security sector governance. Extra funds were made available under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism for measures to reinforce the rule of law in Georgia. The RRM programme was complementary to the first ever (civilian) Rule of Law Mission EUJUST Themis in Georgia in July 2004. Under the new 2004-06 TACIS national programme for Georgia, reforms of the judiciary and law enforcement were made a priority area for cooperation, to include police institution building and improvements in border management as well as increased civil and civil society oversight regarding law enforce- ment. 98 Finally, one must recall that the EU introduced CFSP Joint Actions in support of border guards and to prevent the spillover of the Chechen conflict into Georgia. The EU also assisted in the establishment of a Georgian-Ossetian police force. 99 In recent years, the idea of creating a Stability Pact for the south Caucasus \u2013 following the example of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe \u2013 has repeatedly been brought up but has not so far resulted in a concrete initiative. Yet, from a security sector gover- nance perspective, it might be an attractive option for the EU to embed its respective activities in the region in a broader multilat- eral framework involving all relevant stakeholders. Conclusion Although the scope and nature of EU efforts at promoting security sector governance in its eastern neighbourhood vary from country to country, these efforts exhibit a certain pattern of engagement. The EU plays a comparatively strong role with the \u2018transitional\u2019 neighbours which have the prospect of eventual membership, par- ticularly so in the Western Balkans. In the NIS countries, however, the EU plays only a marginal role, which reflects the fact that these countries do not have a perspective of membership, at least not for the time being, although recent political transitions in Georgia and Ukraine provide new windows of opportunity for engaging them in SSR. The availability of the membership \u2018carrot\u2019 seems to shape the scope of the EU\u2019s involvement in, as well as the neighbouring states\u2019 commitment to, improving security sector governance. 58 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 98. \u2018TACIS National Indicative Programme 2004-2006: Georgia\u2019 (23 September 2003), pp. 28-9. 99.

        "3 This cannot, however, be separated from the nature of the evolv- ing relationship between NATO and the EU in the area of security sector governance. While NATO, through the offer of membership or partnership, has been the driving force in promoting democratic governance of the defence sector throughout Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and beyond, the EU is increasingly assum- ing responsibilities for SSR assistance in the Western Balkans, through its SAP and the deployment of ESDP missions. In the Western Balkans, NATO and the EU have arrived at a concerted approach to SSR assistance, the former concentrating on defence issues and the latter on internal security affairs. However, as the for- merly clear military/non-military, external/internal security dichotomy between NATO and the EU has become increasingly blurred, the traditional division of labour in SSR assistance is giv- ing way to more comprehensive SSR approaches embraced by both NATO and the EU: with respect to the Western Balkans, the EU has made the democratic governance of armed forces and intelligence part of the political conditionality for accession, whereas NATO has embarked on a rather broad defence reform assistance pro- gramme for Ukraine and is involved in supporting the demilitari- sation of border security in the Western Balkans and the south Caucasus. The EU\u2019s approach to SSR assistance for its eastern neighbours is not holistic, in the sense that it is mainly focused on border secu- rity, judiciary and police reform and, within these categories, on the development of efficient structures rather than well-governed ones. The emphasis on promoting border security, judiciary and police reform reflects the EU\u2019s primary concern with illegal immi- gration and trafficking of human beings and drugs from (and through) these regions as well as the fact that these activities fall under the JHA part of the acquis communautaire . As for the demo- cratic governance of border guards and police forces, although ref- erences to the need for democratic accountability of the police, for example, can be found in a number of EU documents, this dimen- sion appears to be totally absent from the EU\u2019s core SSR project in the region, i.e. the development of integrated border management systems. Ironically, the issue of democratic governance receives the highest attention in the context of armed forces and defence struc- tures \u2013 an area where, thus far, the EU has refrained from providing technical assistance. 100 59 The eastern neighbours 100. This, however, is about to change, as evidenced by the EU\u2019s most recent operation in the DRC \u2013 EUSEC DR Congo \u2013 which is tasked to assist the host govern- ment in defence reform, the re- structuring of armed forces and DDR (see Chapter 2). cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 59 ",

        "The southern neighbours The southern neighbourhood of the EU ranges from the Atlantic coast of Morocco to Syria. Two Mediterranean countries (Cyprus and Malta) joined the Union in 2004; Turkey was accepted as an accession country at the EU summit in Brussels in December 2004. The other countries in the south, the Arab countries of the Maghreb and the Mashraq as well as Israel, do not have any mem- bership prospects. The EU\u2019s entire southern neighbourhood, with the exception of Turkey and Israel, has a serious democracy and freedom deficit. 101 This chapter describes how the EU assumed the task of engag- ing with Turkey on security sector reform, but ignored the very same issue when it came to cooperation with partner states in North Africa and the Middle East. With regard to Turkey, it is the EU and not NATO that has been driving the reform process of the country\u2019s defence sector. Even though the EU has not (yet) adopted a comprehensive policy in this field, and has largely lim- ited its demands for reforms to one institution \u2013 the Turkish National Security Council \u2013 it has been able to gain valuable expe- rience in a domain that is new to it. With respect to partner states in North Africa and the Middle East, by contrast, the EU has been reluctant to address the demo- cratic deficit and has hitherto only dealt with security sector gov- ernance in a sporadic manner. In stark contrast to Central and Eastern Europe, where security sector reform has been addressed in the wake of the region\u2019s democratic transformation, the pro- motion of SSR in the Mediterranean and the Middle East is par- ticularly difficult because the political leaders of the region remain reluctant to embrace the principles of democratic gover- nance. In addition to the democratic deficit, the EU\u2019s southern neigh- bourhood has a serious security deficit with potential spillover effects on Europe. However, the EU has not been able to engage the region convincingly in a security dialogue. 102 Furthermore, 61 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 101.

        "4 the EU prefers to deal with the region in terms of programmes rather than policies. NATO, in turn, during its 2004 summit in Istanbul, launched two policy initiatives that include coopera- tion with Mediterranean and Gulf states, in particular in the domain of civil-military relations and defence reform, which are discussed towards the end of this chapter. Pushing for civilian control of the military in Turkey The reform of the Turkish security sector has been a sine qua non of Turkey\u2019s accession to the EU. This has not been an easy task, because the Turkish military establishment has traditionally had a droit de regard over national politics. In fact, as recently as 1997, the Turkish military removed politicians from power and overthrew a democratically elected government. Even though Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952, there has always been great reluc- tance within the Alliance to raise the issue of democratic gover- nance of the Turkish armed forces. Turkey\u2019s aspiration to join the EU \u2013 it formally submitted its application in 1987 \u2013 and the pre-accession process have been key factors behind reforms of the country\u2019s security sector over recent years. In order to meet the political conditionalities contained in the Copenhagen criteria, Turkey undertook to implement a num- ber of far-reaching reforms of its security sector, including both its armed and internal security forces. While the security sector is not mentioned explicitly in the Copenhagen criteria, which contain some references to democratic governance, and respect for the rule of law and human rights, the EU has identified a number of spe- cific reform objectives which have been of direct relevance to the country\u2019s security sector. These have included in particular the removal of the \u2018guardianship\u2019 role of the military in Turkish poli- tics and the powers of the National Security Council, ensuring respect for human rights, eliminating the use of torture by Turk- ish security forces, preventing arbitrary detention, and the aboli- tion of the death penalty. Other important EU demands, which are, however, less directly relevant to the country\u2019s security sector, have concerned the Kurdish issue and the conflict with Greece over Cyprus. While, at the Luxembourg summit of 1997, Turkey was excluded from the enlargement process, ostensibly because of its 62 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 62 ",
        "4 human rights record, a number of developments that have taken place within the EU since then \u2013 such as the change of government in Germany and the more benign attitude of Greece towards Turkey in the aftermath of the earthquake in 1999 \u2013 eventually paved the way for Turkey\u2019s formal recognition as an EU candidate country at the Helsinki Summit in 1999. However, even though Turkey was formally granted the status of candidate country in Helsinki, in November 2000 the European Commission pointed out that Turkey still failed to meet some of the political require- ments of the Copenhagen criteria. As mentioned in earlier regular reports on progress made by Turkey in fulfilling the accession cri- teria, the main obstacles were seen in the political power of the mil- itary, a lack of minority rights and insufficient respect for human rights more generally. 103 For the EU, a core concern has always been the lack of civilian control of the armed forces in Turkey. However, the EU has shied away from demanding comprehensive reforms from Turkey in this area, and has limited itself largely to one specific institution, namely the NSC. Subsequent to the Helsinki summit, the specific requirements for Turkey to join the EU were outlined in the Acces- sion Partnership Document of December 2000, which sets out a number of short- and medium-term reform objectives. Among the 17 short-term \u2018priority areas\u2019 that are listed in the Accession Part- nership Document there is no explicit reference to reform of the security sector. 104 Possibly as a matter of convenience, the EU largely reduced the complex issue of security sector reform to the question of the NSC. Here, the EU has called upon Turkey to \u2018align the constitutional role of the National Security Council as an advi- sory body to the Government in accordance with the practice of EU Member States\u2019. The document also demands that Turkey take all necessary measures to fight against the practice of torture, bring conditions of detention into line with international stan- dards, strengthen respect for human rights by Turkish authori- ties, and increase the accountability of the police. 105 At the 2003 review of the Accession Partnership with Turkey, the EU Council explicitly referred to civilian control of the armed forces by recom- mending that Turkey should \u2018adapt the functioning of the National Security Council in order to align civilian control of the military with practice in EU Member States\u2019. 106 The EU has but- tressed its approach to encouraging reforms in Turkey with a pol- icy of conditionality.

        "4 EU has been evaluating the progress Turkey has been making towards meeting European standards. The reports \u2018outline the steps taken . . . in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, and the Acces- sion Partnership listing short and medium-term recommenda- tions to achieve that end\u2019. 107 In Turkey, its official recognition as a \u2018EU candidate\u2019 has sparked a gradual but nevertheless far-reaching reform process which has involved both the political role of the military and other elements of the country\u2019s security sector. It is noteworthy in this regard that these reforms only began in earnest once Turkey was formally recognised as a \u2018candidate country\u2019. Earlier calls for reform by the EU had not been heeded by the government in power, as they were considered by many domestic actors within Turkey as too costly to enact solely to please the EU. 108 Major reforms of the NSC were initiated as part of the final leg- islative package on democratic reform in 2003, in order to bring Turkey into line with EU requirements. The main effects of these have been to strip the NSC of its executive powers and to trans- form it into a merely \u2018advisory\u2019 body, and to increase the number of civilian members, which are now in the majority. 109 In August 2004, a civilian became Secretary-General of the NSC for the first time. Reforms have also aimed at reducing the power of the military with regard to other state institutions. For example, the formerly military-dominated Higher Education Board has been brought under civilian control. Moreover, the military\u2019s formerly easy access to financial resources has been limited by new legislation on transparency of defence expenditure. In this regard, the 2004 Reg- ular Report on Turkey noted that budgetary transparency had been enhanced by the permission granted to the civilian Court of Auditors \u2018to audit military and defence expenditures\u2019. 110 Regarding the country\u2019s internal security apparatus, important reforms over recent years have been enacted mainly through amendments to the country\u2019s Penal Code, the Anti-Terror Act, and the Law on Political Parties. Inter alia these have involved the aboli- tion of the death penalty, an increase in penalties for torture- related crimes, and the strengthening of a number of basic free- doms, such as freedom of expression, freedom of association and gender equality. Similarly, at the procedural level, retrial rights have been established for individuals in cases that have been in conflict with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.

        "4 the infamous State Security Courts have been abolished. In order to ensure effective implementation of this new legislation, human rights boards which are responsible for adjudicating human rights complaints have been set up in major towns and cities. 111 An important focus of EU accession-driven police reforms has been to enhance Turkey\u2019s police forces (National Police and Gendarmerie) in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking through capacity-building and training programmes. 112 However, despite Turkey\u2019s progress in the field of security sec- tor governance, the EU remains generally sceptical about, and vig- ilant over, the implementation of these reform packages, and the extent to which changes in legislation actually have an impact on political and social life in Turkey. Thus, in its 2004 Regular Report, the European Commission, while welcoming the reform of the NSC and observing that \u2018civil-military relations are evolving towards European standards\u2019, also expresses concern about the various \u2018informal mechanisms\u2019 though which the NSC continues to influence political life in Turkey. 113 The European Parliament, which has traditionally been much more vocal in criticising the lack of democratic governance and respect for human rights in Turkey, also continues to be sceptical about the reforms enacted by the Turkish leadership. In its March 2004 report, it, too, welcomes the efforts of the Turkish govern- ment to bring defence expenditure under parliamentary control, but at the same time points to the \u2018influential (formal and infor- mal) army network comprising inter alia think tanks, businesses and funds, which could prove to be an obstacle to reform of the state\u2019. Similarly, it notes that that \u2018torture practices and mistreat- ment still continue\u2019 and that \u2018little progress\u2019 has been made in this regard. In general, the European Parliament considers that there remains a \u2018wide gulf between the principles of the European rule of law and judicial principles in Turkey\u2019. 114 It is evident that EU conditionalities alone have not been suffi- cient to push Turkey ahead with reforms that redistribute the political control of military power within Turkish society. Rather, the reform process needs to be sustained from within the security system. Such support has come mainly from General Hilmi Ozk\u00f6k, the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces and mem- ber of the NSC. By putting himself behind these reforms, General Ozk\u00f6k has clashed with the Euro-sceptics within the Turkish armed forces as well as with the land army, army intelligence units, 65 The southern neighbours 111.

        "4 and the corps of gendarmes \u2018that oppose such reforms, which they find excessively constraining\u2019. 115 The problem of sustained reform is that the Turkish Army continues to use international or national crises such as Cyprus or the fight against Kurdish insur- gents in south-east Turkey to reassert its standing in domestic pol- itics. The Army\u2019s main argument against reform has been that national security and unity must take precedence over democrati- sation. For Turkey to consolidate its rapprochement with the EU, these reform processes will need to reach a point where they are irreversible. To achieve this objective the EU should use the Acces- sion Process to make sure that all reform measures are fully imple- mented. This is a long-term objective and will probably require a new generation of General Staff and commanding officers. Finally, the transformation of the \u2018mind-set\u2019, political culture and attitude within Turkish society with regards to civil-military rela- tions needs to be actively supported. A great challenge for the EU will be to better coordinate and eventually combine in a common framework the policy approach of the efforts on both defence reform and internal security reform. Soft security approach towards the southern Mediter- ranean The European Security Strategy positions the Mediterranean in the strategic neighbourhood of the enlarged EU. Over the past ten years the EU has created a solid framework of cooperation with its Mediterranean partners. The partnership is, however, troubled by ruling \u00e9lites in the southern Mediterranean region that are hostile towards reform and a public that has grown suspicious of both its own leaders and Western motives for cooperation. As Chapter 2 has shown, the question of democratic governance of the security sec- tor is closely linked to more general reform objectives such as democratisation and improvement of human rights. This section shows that the EU has been rather reluctant to push for democratic governance of the security sector in the Mediterranean region even though it would have the instruments to do so. Numerous strategic changes are defining the relationship between the EU and the southern Mediterranean states at the beginning of the twenty-first century. First, the terrorist attacks 66 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 115. David L.

        "4 of 9/11, and then the bombings in Casablanca and Madrid by Islamist groups, clearly show the importance of the Mediter- ranean \u2018as an area of strategic concern, with a bearing on internal as well as regional security\u2019. 116 Second, the United States and Europe have come to consider the lack of democracy and exclu- sionary policies in the region as one of the root causes of Islamic terrorism. Thus, at least on a declaratory level, the promotion of democracy has become one of the preferred policies of the West with regard to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Third, the US military overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime and the continuing conflict in Iraq has a great potential to desta- bilise the Middle East and Gulf region. The Iraq war has also led to deep transatlantic divisions over the questions of regime change with illegitimate use of force. Finally, the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004, the replacement of the senior Palestinian leader- ship and the announced Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip have opened new opportunities for the Palestinians and the Israelis as well as the international stakeholders to move ahead in finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Democratic deficit and deficiencies in the security sector The Greater Mediterranean is one of the regions in the world with the largest democratic deficit. 117 This observation is closely linked to what the Arab Human Development Report refers to as \u2018Free- dom Deficit\u2019, i.e. a lack of freedom of expression, the right of asso- ciation and choice. 118 As a consequence of these deficits, there are several deficiencies in the defence sectors of countries in the region. These include: (cid:90) Limited civilian participation in and oversight of security policy-making . In most countries of the region, security policy is largely the pre- serve of the military, with limited involvement of civilian authorities or the public at large. Parliaments, and civil society generally, play a fairly modest role in the political process in southern Mediterranean countries, and the political systems are characterised by a powerful executive that exerts control over all other branches of government. (cid:90) Limited separation of police and military forces . In many countries of the southern Mediterranean, the dividing line between the func- tions of internal and external security forces is blurred, with the military playing a considerable role in internal security, as well as 67 The southern neighbours 116.

According to the ratings of Freedom House, all Arab partner countries (Alge- ria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Mau- ritania, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia) show ratings of between 5 and 7 in terms of political rights (seven being the least free or dem- ocratic category). According to the overall rating of FH (taking into account both political rights and civil liberties), the majority of these countries (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Mauritania, Syria and Tunisia), are qualified as \u2018not free\u2019, whereas only Jordan and Morocco are considered \u2018partly free\u2019. None of them qualifies as \u2018free\u2019 (data from 2004). See An- nexe 4. 118. UNDP, Regional Bureau for Arab States, Arab Human Develop- ment Report 2004.

        "4 in domestic politics more generally. A clear definition of the respective roles of the police and the military is lacking. This goes hand-in-hand with a conflation of regime security with the security of the state as a whole. The security of the regime in power is often equated with the security of the state as such, with the consequence that external defence forces are sometimes mobilised to counter opponents to an existing regime, or that political dissidents are tried not by ordinary but rather by mili- tary courts. (cid:90) High levels of defence spending . Southern Mediterranean countries generally have high levels of military spending, averaging more than 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2003. 119 Moreover, given the various informal sources of income of these countries\u2019 military estab- lishments, it can be assumed that military spending is actually far higher than the official figures. There are multiple reasons for the deficits in democracy and freedom, including underdevelopment, low human development opportunities, a difficult colonial heritage, the prevalence of authoritarian regimes and a clear, even if partially understand- able, bias towards internal stability and external mistrust. More- over, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and more recently the war in Iraq are often used as a pretext by Arab governments not to embrace democratic reforms. In addition, there are a number of other difficulties in promoting democratic governance in the security sectors of the countries of the region. 120 The first major obstacle to reform is the intimate but opaque relationship between the security establishment and the ruling \u00e9lite in most southern Mediterranean states. This intimacy is based on shared interests in maintaining political power as well as on economic ties. In many countries of the region, \u2018the military has its own sources of revenue for which it is not accountable and is under no observable political pressure either better to utilize its capital or to divest itself of enterprises, as is the case with regard to the civilian public sector.\u2019 121 Second, on a more conceptual level, the compatibility between Islam and democratic governance is questioned by some ana- lysts. 122 They typically point both to the absence of liberal/indi- vidualistic ideas in Islam as a religious and political doctrine, as well as to the lack of a tradition of democratic governance in Arab countries. Less categorical arguments within this debate suggest 68 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 119. See Annexe 4. 120.

        "4 that Arab countries could achieve some form of democratic gover- nance, not necessarily a \u2018Western-style\u2019 but rather some other form of democracy. A third obstacle is the apparent double standards that exist when Western states favour \u2018stable\u2019 regimes in the region, even if these are undemocratic, over \u2018unstable\u2019 but potentially more dem- ocratic regimes. This is particularly the case when \u2018instability\u2019 in the countries of the region could have spillover effects on the terri- tory of EU countries, in the form, for instance, of large-scale refugee flows. European countries\u2019 policies towards Algeria after 1992 are an often-cited example in this regard. A final obstacle to the promotion of democracy is the Western \u2018war on international terrorism\u2019. The argument can be made that in the current war against terrorism all that matters is being a reli- able ally in the struggle against terror, regardless of how demo- cratic the country is. Thus, countries or regimes which used to be shunned by the West for undemocratic behaviour are now embraced as important allies in the fight against terror. 123 This being said, recent developments in, for example, Lebanon, do suggest that at least certain steps towards democratisation and accountability in the security field are indeed possible in the region. In the aftermath of the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, in February 2005 and the announced retreat of Syrian troops from Lebanon, growing public pressure has led to seemingly far-reaching purges of the country\u2019s security and intelligence services and the resignation of several of its most senior chiefs. The UN Fact-Finding Mission to Lebanon, whose task it was to inquire into the assassination of Rafik Hariri, also pointed to serious deficiencies, including the absence of effec- tive oversight of the Lebanese security sector, laying the primary responsibility for the lack of security and law and order in the country on both the Lebanese security services and Syrian Military Intelligence. 124 Among Lebanese political forces, the need to reform the country\u2019s security and intelligence services and to bring these institutions under control of the country\u2019s civil (judi- cial) authorities has been emphasised, for instance, by General Michel Aoun\u2019s reform programme, whose Free Patriotic Move- ment, in June 2005, was invited to join the new government led by Saad Hariri\u2019s party. 125 69 The southern neighbours 123.

        "4 EU policies towards the southern Mediterranean EU policy towards the Mediterranean region is multilayered and driven by actors with different outlooks and philosophies. 126 Some EU member states, through a realpolitik approach, favour primarily a status quo in the region: containment of terrorism and illegal migration as well as assured continued access to energy sources in North Africa and the Gulf. The European Commission, in turn, acts on the \u2018liberal\u2019 premise that increased economic coop- eration and trade, political reform, democratic transformation and respect for human rights will foster long-term stability in the region. In its Common Strategy on the Mediterranean Region that was launched in 2000, the EU tried unsuccessfully to consolidate, or at least harmonise, these different objectives for policy-making towards the Mediterranean. Nowadays, the EU pursues its security policy towards the Mediterranean through a number of instru- ments, including the EMP or Barcelona Process, the ENP, and the ESDP, on which a dialogue has been established since the Naples Euro-Mediterranean Conference in December 2003. In view of the critical developments in Iraq and also Iran in 2003, the EU took the decision to create a regional stability strategy for what could be defined as the \u2018Mediterranean and the Wider Middle East\u2019. This strategy or \u2018line of action\u2019 would supplement EU relations with the Mediterranean partners. In June 2004, the EU proposed in a report to combine these two strategies into an \u2018EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East\u2019. 127 The Barcelona Process and the European Neighbourhood Policy The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is a framework for develop- ing a \u2018zone of peace and stability\u2019. It includes a politico-security dia- logue, economic relations that should lead to a free trade zone, and social-cultural relations. This multilateral framework is under- pinned by a network of Association Agreements that regulate bilat- eral relations between the EU and individual partner states. With the EU membership of Malta and Cyprus, and Turkey as an acces- sion country, the remaining Mediterranean partners comprise only the Mediterranean Arab countries, the Palestinian Authority and Israel. There has been little progress in the domain of security cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean framework. Efforts at norm-setting on comprehensive security have been blocked ever since 1999: the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stabil- ity proposed by the EU was rejected by some Arab states.

        "4 sequence, the Charter has been watered down from a blueprint for a comprehensive \u2018Stability Pact\u2019 to an arrangement that does not go much beyond the commitments contained in the Political and Security Chapter of the Barcelona Declaration. After ten years of its existence, the EMP\u2019s lack of visible results in the political and secu- rity chapter has given rise to considerable criticism, both by gov- ernment officials and policy analysts. The new European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is intended to promote political, economic and social reforms with the objec- tive of giving the Partner states access to the EU\u2019s four freedoms (free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital). It is con- ceived as an instrument of conflict prevention and security build- ing with the post-enlargement neighbourhood. In December 2004, the EU proposed Action Plans under this policy for four Arab EMP partners, namely Jordan, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia. 128 Moreover, in March 2005, country reports which are to serve as a basis for future Action Plans were also issued for Egypt and Lebanon. 129 Democratic governance and human rights are an integral part of this policy, and the Com- mission refers to \u2018common values\u2019 that should hold Europe and the southern Mediterranean together. 130 Moreover, the Action Plans which the EU has proposed for the EMP Partners contain a number of provisions regarding SSR-related activities such as judicial reform, the rule of law, transparency and the fight against corruption. Despite this, however, these Action Plans stop short of measures aimed at enhancing democratic governance of the secu- rity sector. One important way in which the ENP differs from the EMP is that the ENP allows the Partner countries to pursue a policy of self-differentiation. In practice, this translates into a cooperation based on bilateral action plans on a country-by-country basis. The principle of self-differentiation allows the EU to pursue a multi- speed policy in the Mediterranean region and to formulate tailor- made reform packages that could be subject to EU conditionali- ties. This is the case with the ENP Action Plans, as will be discussed below. Programmes to promote democracy The EU\u2019s policy on human rights and democratisation in the Mediterranean has been \u2018presented by the EU as a strategic, not merely ethical imperative\u2019. 131 However, human rights and democ- 71 The southern neighbours 128.

Commitments will also be sought to certain essential as- pects of the EU\u2019s external action, including, in particular, the fight against terrorism and the prolifer- ation of weapons of mass destruc- tion, as well as abidance by inter- national law and efforts to achieve conflict resolution\u2019.

        "4 ratisation have been low on the EMP agenda, \u2018despite the fact that the EU does have a range of tools at its disposal to exercise pressure for the respect for human rights and democracy in the Mediter- ranean\u2019. 132 The policy instruments for promoting democratic reform include the Association Agreements and the European Neighbourhood Action Plans. According to the Presidency Con- clusions of the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting of 2004 in The Hague, the Mediterranean partners agreed to work within the framework of these arrangements \u2018towards the implementation of political reforms, and welcomed a structured dialogue, based on joint ownership, on co-operation on human rights and democrati- sation including support for civil society\u2019. 133 With the US drive towards the promotion of democracy in the \u2018Greater Middle East\u2019 that led to the Middle East Partnership Ini- tiative (MEPI) and the G-8 Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative, the EU responded with the abovementioned \u2018Strategic Partnership\u2019 between the EU, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The policy agenda of that partnership covers the Middle East Peace Process, the Barcelona process, the promotion of a political dialogue on human rights and the rule of law, non-proliferation, security dialogue and counter-terrorism, migration and economic reforms, social developments, and cultural dialogue. 134 Security governance in EU-Mediterranean cooperation Neither the EU nor Mediterranean states formally embrace the concept of democratic governance of the security sector in their EMP discourse. The EU approach to security in the region has been largely limited to soft security cooperation and, more recently, a dialogue on ESDP issues. 135 Nevertheless, this dialogue could, in the future, also include items dedicated to security sector reform. The few EU-sponsored activities in the domain of police reform and the training of police forces in human rights are linked to secu- rity sector reform only by approximation and not by design. On a normative level, the Barcelona Declaration establishes a link between domestic political conduct and regional security. It is also for this reason that the human rights commitments con- tained in the Barcelona Declaration were made part of the Political and Security Chapter of the Declaration. On a general level, in the Barcelona Declaration the partners agreed to foster \u2018political plu- ralism\u2019 and to \u2018develop the rule of law and democracy in their polit- ical systems\u2019. More specifically they undertake to \u2018refrain from 72 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 132.

        "4 developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements, at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the same degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry.\u2019 Institutional reform, promotion of democracy and human rights projects in Arab EMP countries have been carried out within the framework of the MEDA Democracy programme, and the EIDHR. Overall funding for human rights and democracy promo- tion projects under MEDA has, however, traditionally been rather limited. Most of these funds have also gone to \u2018soft\u2019 projects, such as support for NGOs in the fields of development assistance and environmental protection. 136 Another core focus of MEDA aid has been improvement of \u2018good governance\u2019 in the region, but projects in this field have concentrated mainly on technical or reg- ulatory aspects, in particular harmonisation with the EU\u2019s single market rules. 137 This may change with the recently adopted ENP Action Plans. Following negotiations with the partners concerned, in December 2004, plans to guide EU relations with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia, amongst others, were approved. Although those plans are not identical, references to dialogue on ESDP, crisis management, the judicial system and democracy and human rights may have an impact on security sec- tor governance. 138 Judicial reforms and counter-terrorism The events of 9/11 did lend greater urgency to the need for reform in the region, as lack of democracy in the Middle East increasingly came to be viewed as one of the main causes of terrorism. However, there has been no substantial rise in funds allocated by the EU to institutional reform and democracy promotion in the region, although there does seem to have been at least a slight increase in the field of judicial reform. 139 Relatively large projects on judicial reform have been launched in Algeria ( \u20ac 15 million), Morocco ( \u20ac 28 million) and Tunisia ( \u20ac 30 million) in recent years. Moreover, in Algeria, a police reform project (which was initiated in 2000) has been carried out in the framework of the ENP. The main objective of this project has been to professionalise Algerian police forces, and to enhance respect for human rights and the rule of law. In addition, an important goal of the EU has been to improve the abil- 73 The southern neighbours 136.

A total of \u20ac 10 million has thus far been allocated to this project. 140 Since 1999, EU countries have generally been devoting more attention to internal security or JHA cooperation with Arab EMP countries, reflecting not only deepening involvement of EU coun- tries in this area but also growing concerns with internal security challenges such as illegal immigration, drug trafficking and organised crime. Since early 2001, JHA has generally become a pri- ority area within the EMP, with regular meetings of senior officials of interior ministries being held in parallel with meetings on polit- ical and security matters. 141 In the aftermath of 9/11, these efforts also increasingly focused on terrorism in addition to illegal migra- tion, drug trafficking and organised crime. A framework docu- ment on a regional cooperation programme on JHA issues was adopted at the Valencia conference of 2002. The development of this programme has resulted in regional and bilateral co-opera- tion in the area of justice, freedom and security. 142 Since the terrorist attacks on New York and Madrid, the EU has been concentrating its policy on strengthening cooperation between law enforcement agencies of EMP countries. For this pur- pose, the newest generation of Association Agreements contain clauses on security cooperation relating to the fight against ter- rorism. 143 The downside of these anti-terrorist clauses is \u2013 as is the case for Algeria, for instance \u2013 that they give the partner state carte blanche with regards to its security sector, as well as its arms trade and defence policies. 144 The official view within the EU is that enhanced security cooperation with Arab EMP partner countries is consistent and indeed supportive of its objective of promoting democracy and \u2018good governance\u2019 in the region. 145 It is, however, often pointed out that the EU\u2019s enhanced focus on counter-ter- rorism has actually been detrimental in terms of improving accountability of and respect for human rights by security forces of Arab EMP countries. Morocco, for instance, has been criticised by human rights organisations for its anti-terror legislation and policies adopted in the aftermath of the Casablanca bombings in 2003. According to Human Rights Watch, for instance, Morocco\u2019s campaign against Islamist militants, which has also involved fast- track convictions, has been undermining the considerable progress made by Morocco in this field over recent years. 146 Moreover, it seems clear that both the EU and individual EU countries have tended to devote resources mainly to enhancing 74 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 140.

        "4 the efficiency of police forces of southern Mediterranean coun- tries in preventing undocumented migration across the Mediter- ranean and less to actual police reform. In October 2002, for exam- ple, the EU allocated \u20ac 40 million to Morocco for the construction of a coast control system along the country\u2019s northern shores aimed at preventing migration and drug trafficking across the Straits of Gibraltar. 147 In order to supply Libya with military equipment to beef up its border controls, Italy has also been push- ing to lift the arms embargo imposed on Libya since 1986. In late 2004, the EU agreed to end these sanctions against Libya. More- over, the EU has recently set up a \u20ac 250 million fund for assisting third countries in preventing irregular migration towards the EU, and in 2004 a project by the European Police College was carried out aimed at training police forces of southern Mediterranean countries in fighting terrorism and human trafficking. 148 Overall, with regard to the EU\u2019s policies in this area, it can be argued that operative aspects and short-term security concerns with illegal migration, drug trafficking and terrorism have taken precedence over institutional reform objectives, such as enhanc- ing respect for human rights, accountability and civilian oversight over security forces in the region. Reforming the security sector of the Palestinian Authority (PA) EU assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) not only has a long history \u2013 dating back to the early 1970s \u2013 but over the years, the EU has also emerged as the main donor supporting the Palestinian Authority. Since 1995, the PA has been a member of the EMP, and in 1997 an Association Agreement between the EU and the PA entered into force. Between 1994 and 2004, EU support for the Palestinians amounted to a total of more than \u20ac 2 billion, and it has been argued that it is mainly thanks to the EU that the PA has been able to avoid collapse. 149 This assistance has focused on both long- term institution-building as well as on humanitarian assistance; this latter aspect became increasingly important after the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000. The EU\u2019s membership of the Quartet and the International Task Force on Palestinian Reform estab- lished in 2002 also provides it with political mandates to engage in the reform process of the PA. It was mainly the growing awareness of the problem of corrup- tion within the PA, as well as mounting allegations that EU aid was being diverted to finance terrorist activities, that led the EU to 75 The southern neighbours 147.

        "4 focus more strongly on \u2018institutional reforms\u2019 of the PA, such as independence of the judicial system and financial transparency. Some of these efforts have directly touched upon the Palestinian security sector. Thus, in 2002-03, judicial reform programmes amounting to a total of \u20ac 7 million were launched aimed at mod- ernising the Palestinian judicial system. These programmes com- prise both material assistance and the training of judges and pros- ecutors. Moreover, the EU has been organizing human rights training for Palestinian security services. 150 Over recent years, the EU has also generally shifted its assistance policy towards more \u2018targeted\u2019 aid instead of direct payments to the budget of the Pales- tinian authority \u2013 although a survey by the EU\u2019s anti-fraud office concluded that EU funds had not been utilised for terrorist activi- ties. Most recently, the EU has initiated police reform projects in the Occupied Territories, aware of the growing need for effective policing that will be necessary after the Israeli pull-out from Gaza and parts of the West Bank. In June 2004, the European Council declared its \u2018readiness to support the Palestinian Authority in tak- ing responsibility for law and order, and in particular in improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity\u2019. 151 In January 2005, the EU set up an EU Coordination Office for Palestinian Police Support (COPPS), which consists of four EU police experts and is based in East Jerusalem and Ramallah. Its objectives include both immediate operational elements, in particular the delivery of tech- nical equipment, as well as longer-term transformation of the Palestinian police forces, such as the reform of management struc- tures and the development of proper accountability mechan- isms. 152 Transatlantic relations and security sector governance in the Middle East The EU\u2019s SSR-related activities in the Mediterranean and the Mid- dle East, however modest thus far, should also be seen in the larger context of Western countries\u2019 efforts to promote democracy in the region, and the divergences between the EU and the United States in this regard. In general terms, the EU and the United States are in agreement that democracy promotion should be pursued in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. But, at present, this common philosophy is eroded by different world-views, threat perceptions 76 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 150. Ibid. 151.

        "4 and policies. The EU views the need for democratisation in the region as a corollary to its mainstream policies of development assistance and economic as well as political partnership building. Moreover, the EU sees its programmes for the promotion of reforms in the Middle East as complementary but independent measures to those of the United States, 153 which has a much more direct and \u2018can-do\u2019 perspective on political reform and democrati- sation in the Middle East. It can be argued that the objective of addressing the democratic deficit \u2013 together with addressing the security deficit \u2013 has become much more salient with the current war on terror, at least as far as the Middle East is concerned. The Bush administration considers the lack of democracy and exclusionary policies in the region as one of the main \u2018root causes\u2019 of Islamist terrorism. Consequently, fighting such terrorism also requires the promotion of demo- cratic governance in Arab countries. The various US initiatives reflect this understanding: MEPI, launched in 2003, the US-led \u2018Partnership for Progress and a Common Future with the Broader Middle East and North Africa\u2019 adopted in the context of the 2004 G-8 summit and the Istanbul Summit Initiatives all propose coop- eration with a view to political, economic and social reforms in the wider Middle East and the Mediterranean. Further political impe- tus for political reform in the region has been given by President Bush\u2019s \u2018arc of reform\u2019 speech in Brussels on 22 February 2005. This speech indicates that the second Bush administration is inclined to tackle the democratic deficit in the Middle East even more vig- orously than before, a situation which will put the Europeans under additional pressure. Nevertheless, US initiatives to promote democracy have, for the time being, not received appropriate financial resources. Some of the US activities in the region also have a narrower anti-terrorist focus and lack a governance dimension. For instance, in May 2005, the US government decided to launch the Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorism Initiative, based on the earlier Pan-Sahel Initiative, which was carried out in the aftermath of 9/11. The initiative is to cover Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as a number of sub-Saharan African countries (Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal). As was the case for its predecessor, the main objective of the initiative is to train special forces of these countries, in particular in the field of counter-ter- rorism. 77 The southern neighbours 153.

        "4 The democratic deficit and the need for defence reform have been addressed more directly by the initiatives launched at NATO\u2019s 2004 Istanbul summit. The first initiative is an effort \u2013 which falls far short of a \u2018Greater Middle East Initiative\u2019 \u2013 to deepen the existing Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) with seven countries in North Africa and the Middle East, and to transform it into a genuine \u2018partnership\u2019. It is not yet clear what the \u2018deepening\u2019 should entail, particularly in view of the sombre mood of some Arab states regarding the US military presence in Iraq. Formally, the objectives of the Partnership are dialogue, interoperability, defence reform and the fight against terrorism. For the first time \u2013 for some NATO officials possibly prematurely \u2013 NATO calls upon the MD states to \u2018promot[e] democratic control of armed forces and facilitat[e] transparency in national defence planning and defence budgeting in support of defence reform\u2019. 154 This is one of seven \u2018priority areas\u2019 that should support the following objectives of collaboration: enhancing the existing political dialogue; achiev- ing interoperability; developing defence reform; and contributing to the fight against terrorism. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer reiterated this offer at the Munich Security Confer- ence 2005, when, referring to the MD countries, he offered to \u2018assist interested countries in the field of security sector reform and defence institution building\u2019. 155 The second initiative is the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI). With this, NATO aims to reach out for the first time to Gulf states (i.e. the \u2018broader Middle East region\u2019). The somewhat sur- prising aspect of the ICI is that \u2013 perhaps because it is based on the PfP template \u2013 it contains explicit language on democratic gover- nance of the security sector. There is, however, no formal institu- tional link to PfP. According to the North Atlantic Council, the objective of the Initiative is to enhance security and stability through a new transatlantic engagement, offering \u2018tailored advice on defence reform, defence budgeting, defence planning and civil- military relations, and promoting military-to-military coopera- tion to contribute to interoperability [and] fighting terror- ism . . .\u2019. 156 In contrast to the PfP partner states, but as in the case of the EU, the carrot of membership cannot be used with NATO partner states in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. This means that it is too early to provide the partner states with a \u2018Mediterranean Partnership Framework Agreement\u2019 similar to that of the 1994 78 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 154. \u2018A More Ambitious and Ex- panded Framework for the Mediterranean Dialogue\u2019, NATO Policy Document , 9 July 2004. 155.

        "4 PfP Framework Agreement, which would include provisos on \u2018democratic control of the armed forces\u2019. This situation is reminis- cent of the EU\u2019s futile efforts to promote a \u2019Charter for Peace and Security in the Mediterranean\u2019 in the context of the Barcelona Process. Even though the Charter does not contain any explicit language on security sector governance, the Southern partners will continue to shy away from formal arrangements in the field of security governance and democracy. There remains hope that one or other of the Mediterranean partner states may \u2013 under a courageous leadership \u2013 begin to embrace the process of democratisation of the security sector. Progress in this domain \u2013 timid as it may be \u2013 should be supported by substantial positive inducements from the North. The EU would have to assume the lead with regards to areas such as police and judicial reform, whereas NATO would have to deal with defence reform and defence budget control. In this context, it would make sense that the EU and NATO develop a joint strategy on security sector governance promotion in North Africa and the Middle East. Only a combined soft security, political and eco- nomic approach can help countries in transition to engage in a sustained process of reform and eventual democratisation. Conclusion The EU has chosen a gradualist and low-key approach to political reform and democratisation in the southern Mediterranean. This reflects its concerns with balancing the risks and benefits of democracy promotion in the region. The EU should not destabilise fragile governments in its neighbourhood with short-term and intrusive instruments promoting human rights, political reform and security governance. Nevertheless, the EU must come to the understanding that security sector reform is part and parcel of the Mediterranean partner states\u2019 reform efforts. Thus, regardless of the intensity and forcefulness of the EU\u2019s political reform policy, the time is ripe to agree within the EU to a proposal that presents security sector reform as a mid- to long-term objective of the Euro- Mediterranean Partnership. The new Strategic Partnership should recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach will be impossible. The Action Plans in the context of the Neighbourhood Policy include some requirements that can be linked to democratic governance of 79 The southern neighbours cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 79 ",
        "4 the security sector. Since the Association Agreements include legally binding commitments on human rights cooperation, it should also be possible in the medium term to insert provisions regarding the security sector. In view of the various regional impediments to security sector reform, the EU could, in a first step, insert questions of parliamen- tary oversight of the defence sector in the agenda of the new Euro- Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. Moreover, the Charter for Peace and Stability in the Mediterranean should be revitalised, this time with the addition of some language on the need for secu- rity sector governance, with particular reference to the linkage between sustainable development and the need to downsize the defence sectors in the region. Those issues should be discussed by all partners in the EMP. The pitfall of current EU policy with regard to the Mediter- ranean is the temptation to \u2018purchase\u2019 southern cooperation in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and illegal migration with an implicit agreement to keep political reform and security sector governance issues off the common agenda. In the same vein, although the strengthened cooperation between law enforcement agencies across the Mediterranean is an important development, the EU should not ignore the fact that most internal security forces of southern Mediterranean countries have a serious gover- nance problem. Another obstacle remains the reality that Arab states would only embrace reform to the extent that it would pro- vide more legitimacy to the ruling regime but not jeopardise its leadership. Finally, the EU will have to devote most of its attention to man- agement of its largest expansion to date that will also in one way or another include Turkey. In view of this monumental task, the attention it will be able to give to security sector reform in Mediter- ranean countries may be sporadic at best. 80 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 80 ",
        "Conclusions and policy recommendations 81 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 5 This study started out from the assumption that the European Union\u2019s neighbourhood to the east and the south is composed of areas which have to a greater or lesser extent serious deficits in secu- rity, development and democracy, and that the combined effects of these deficits constitute a serious challenge for the EU\u2019s own secu- rity as well as an impediment to its attempts to create \u2018a ring of well governed countries\u2019 in its neighbourhood, as the European Secu- rity Strategy puts it. Although the EU is not yet pursuing a compre- hensive and coherent policy, it has explicitly or implicitly entered into promoting security sector governance in a number of policy areas, such as development cooperation, human rights and democ- ratisation, conflict prevention, crisis management and justice and home affairs. Throughout its eastern and southern neighbour- hood, the EU has increasingly been involved in assisting the reform of police forces, border guards and judicial systems as well as the structures that oversee these security institutions \u2013 albeit to an extent that differs from region to region and with a certain bias in favour of restructuring security institutions as opposed to improv- ing their governance. In the case of the EU\u2019s eastern neighbours , this study has shown that NATO has been the driving force in the promotion of security sector governance, with a clear emphasis on democratic control of armed forces and defence reform. The EU, however, is increasingly assuming responsibilities for SSR assistance in South-Eastern Europe , particularly in the Western Balkans, through its stabilisa- tion and association process and the deployment of ESDP opera- tions. In the Western Balkans, NATO and the EU have succeeded, at least de facto, in developing a concerted approach to SSR assis- tance, with the former concentrating on defence issues and the lat- ter on internal security. With the devolution of NATO (and UN) responsibilities to the EU and in view of the membership perspec- tives of West Balkans countries, the EU has to develop a holistic approach to security sector governance in the region. cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 81 ",
        "5 As regards the NIS area \u2013 the \u2018new\u2019 eastern neighbours \u2013 the EU has so far only played a very marginal role in promoting security sector governance. Even more than in the case of the Western Balkans, the EU is concentrating its efforts on providing support for strengthening border security, police and the judiciary while largely neglecting governance, which should be an integral dimen- sion of any SSR assistance. Given that all of these countries are part of the Euro-Atlantic community and are therefore politically bound by the provisions of the OSCE Code of Conduct, including those relating to the democratic control of armed forces, the EU should develop a much more proactive approach to promoting security sector governance in its \u2018new\u2019 eastern neighbourhood. In the case of the southern neighbours , the EU has assumed the task of engaging with Turkey on a broad range of security sector reform issues, but ignored the very same issues when it comes to cooperation with partner states in North Africa and the Middle East. With regard to Turkey , NATO has failed to address the reform of the politically dominant military apparatus; this task has largely fallen to the EU, which has used the lever of membership to induce and sustain reform in Turkey. Its lack of operational capabilities in the politico-military domain, however, has prevented the EU from adopting a comprehensive approach to civil-military relations in Turkey, where it has largely limited its efforts to reforming the Turkish National Security Council. Apart from that, the EU has provided operational support for non-military aspects of security sector reform such as judicial reform, human rights training and the promotion of professionalisation within the Turkish police and gendarmerie. The lessons learned in promoting democratic governance of the security and defence sectors in Turkey could turn out to be useful for the EU in shaping its future policy towards other neighbours. With regards to the southern Mediterranean region, the EU is con- fronted with the question of how to promote democracy and secu- rity sector governance with partners that are reluctant or unwilling to reform. Here, the EU has pursued a cautious and gradualist part- nership-building process which has been based primarily on devel- opment cooperation and economic reform. Current US pressure for political reform and democratisation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East may pave the way for reform in the security sector as well. For this to happen, however, the conflicts in Iraq and else- where in the Middle East need to be mitigated first. As far as the EU 82 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 82 ",
        "5 is concerned, it will need to devise a policy that appears attractive to the Mediterranean partners without seeming intrusive. It also requires Mediterranean partner states where a courageous leader- ship is prepared to embrace the process of democratisation, includ- ing in the security sector. The self-differentiation and country-by- country approach in the framework of the ENP and the Association Agreements could be used to shift support to those countries that are prepared to engage in the reform of their security sectors. The EU should also make sure that short-sighted policies with regard to preventing illegal migration, drug trafficking and terrorism do not take precedence over institutional reform objec- tives, such as enhancing respect for human rights, accountability and civilian oversight of security forces in southern Mediterranean countries. This will only be possible if the EU realises that demo- cratic governance of the security sector in its neighbourhood is a long-term strategic imperative. The time is ripe for the EU to develop an explicit approach that positions security sector governance in the broad framework of development cooperation, democracy and human rights promo- tion as well as conflict prevention, crisis management and peace- building. This should be applied particularly, but not only, to the EU\u2019s relations with its neighbourhood to the east and the south. 157 Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, could be another region of increasing importance for EU activities in the field of security sec- tor governance. The promotion of security sector governance should be mainstreamed into all relevant policy areas and taken up in specific policy instruments such as the revised Association Agreements, annual accession and association assessment reports, EMP and ENP action plans, country strategy papers, political dia- logues, particularly in the context of counter-terrorism, and last but not least the new financial instruments for the delivery of exter- nal assistance. 158 Unlike any other international actor, the EU would be in a position to promote security sector governance in a holistic way \u2013 covering both non-military and military security domains as well as activities aimed at both restructuring security institutions and improving their democratic accountability. The EU\u2019s liberal democratic identity, its comprehensive mandate, and its evolving activities in the area of security sector governance, would not only permit but indeed call for such an approach. If the EU is to adopt such a holistic approach to promoting security sector governance in its eastern and southern neighbour- 83 Conclusions and policy recommendations 157.

        "5 hood and beyond, it is recommended that it follow three broad guidelines: 159 (cid:90) First, this study has shown that the EU has tended to focus its SSR assistance on building efficient and effective security insti- tutions, border guards and police forces in particular, without necessarily giving much attention to governance issues. This, however, falls short of promoting security sector governance proper, and stands at odds with the EU\u2019s definition of itself as a community of democracies and a promoter of democracy. The EU should therefore systematically embed its SSR-related activ- ities in a (democratic) governance approach aimed at strength- ening civilian, parliamentary and public oversight of the secu- rity sector. (cid:90) Second, this study has also demonstrated that the EU has largely shied away from getting involved in politico-military, particu- larly defence-related, aspects of security sector governance. This, however, does not meet the demands of a holistic approach to security sector governance and neglects the fact that the EU will increasingly be faced with the need to rebuild or reintegrate armed forces and to engage in defence institution-building, par- ticularly in the context of ESDP operations. The EU should therefore not hesitate to integrate democratic control of armed forces and defence reform in its agenda for promoting security sector governance. (cid:90) Third, this study has argued that there is a need to coordinate SSR-related activities of various international organisations in order to avoid overlap, duplication and even competition. In the case of the Euro-Atlantic and adjacent areas, this applies partic- ularly to the EU\u2019s relationship with NATO, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Among these organisations, NATO would become the EU\u2019s most pertinent partner because of its compar- ative advantage on the military and defence side of security sec- tor governance. In short, for the EU and NATO this means the acceptance of a closer relationship with regards to promoting security sector governance within the \u2018new\u2019 eastern and south- ern neighbours \u2013 and possibly beyond. 84 Promoting security sector governance in the EU\u2019s neighbourhood 159.

The participating States consider the democratic political control of military, paramilitary and internal security forces as well as of intelligence services and the police to be an indispensable element of stability and security. They will further the integration of their armed forces with civil society as an important expression of democracy. 21. Each participating State will at all times provide for and maintain effective guidance to and control of its military, paramilitary and security forces by con- stitutionally established authorities vested with democratic legitimacy. Each participating State will provide controls to ensure that such authorities fulfil their constitutional and legal responsibilities. They will clearly define the roles and missions of such forces and their obligation to act solely within the constitu- tional framework. 22. Each participating State will provide for its legislative approval of defence expenditures. Each participating State will, with due regard to national security requirements, exercise restraint in its military expenditures and provide for transparency and public access to information related to the armed forces. 23. Each participating State, while providing for the individual service member's exercise of his or her civil rights, will ensure that its armed forces as such are polit- ically neutral. 24. Each participating State will provide and maintain measures to guard against accidental or unauthorized use of military means. 25. The participating States will not tolerate or support forces that are not accountable to or controlled by their constitutionally established authorities. If a participating State is unable to exercise its authority over such forces, it may seek consultations within the CSCE to consider steps to be taken. 160.

Each participating State will ensure that in accordance with its international commitments its paramilitary forces refrain from the acquisition of combat mis- sion capabilities in excess of those for which they were established. 27. Each participating State will ensure that the recruitment or call-up of personnel for service in its military, paramilitary and security forces is consistent with its obli- gations and commitments in respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 28. The participating States will reflect in their laws or other relevant documents the rights and duties of armed forces personnel. They will consider introducing exemptions from or alternatives to military service. 29. The participating States will make widely available in their respective coun- tries the international humanitarian law of war. They will reflect, in accordance with national practice, their commitments in this field in their military training programmes and regulations. 30. Each participating State will instruct its armed forces personnel in interna- tional humanitarian law, rules, conventions and commitments governing armed conflict and will ensure that such personnel are aware that they are individually accountable under national and international law for their actions. 31. The participating States will ensure that armed forces personnel vested with command authority exercise it in accordance with relevant national as well as international law and are made aware that they can be held individually account- able under those laws for the unlawful exercise of such authority and that orders contrary to national and international law must not be given. The responsibility of superiors does not exempt subordinates from any of their individual responsi- bilities. 32. Each participating State will ensure that military, paramilitary and security forces personnel will be able to enjoy and exercise their human rights and funda- mental freedoms as reflected in CSCE documents and international law, in con- formity with relevant constitutional and legal provisions and with the require- ments of service. 33. Each participating State will provide appropriate legal and administrative procedures to protect the rights of all its forces personnel. 34.

Each participating State will ensure that its defence policy and doctrine are consistent with international law related to the use of armed forces, including in armed conflict, and the relevant commitments of this Code. 36. Each participating State will ensure that any decision to assign its armed forces to internal security missions is arrived at in conformity with constitu- tional procedures. Such decisions will prescribe the armed forces' missions, ensuring that they will be performed under the effective control of constitu- tionally established authorities and subject to the rule of law. If recourse to force cannot be avoided in performing internal security missions, each participating State will ensure that its use must be commensurate with the needs for enforce- ment. The armed forces will take due care to avoid injury to civilians or their property. 37. The participating States will not use armed forces to limit the peaceful and lawful exercise of their human and civil rights by persons as individuals or as rep- resentatives of groups nor to deprive them of their national, religious, cultural, linguistic or ethnic identity.

Human Development Report 2002 162 Principles of democratic governance in the security sector (cid:90) Ultimate authority on key security matters must rest with elected representa- tives; (cid:90) Security organisations should operate in accord with international and con- stitutional law and respect human rights; (cid:90) Information about security planning and resources must be widely available, both within government and to the public. This means that security forces should be subject to the same principles of public sector management as other parts of government, with adjustments for confidentiality appropriate to national security; (cid:90) Civil-military relations must be based on a well-articulated hierarchy of authority between civil authorities and defence forces, on the mutual rights and obligations of civil authorities and defence forces, and on a relationship with civil society based on transparency and respect for human rights; (cid:90) Civil authorities need to have the capacity to exercise political control over the operations and financing of security forces; (cid:90) Civil society must have the means and capacity to monitor security forces and provide constructive input into the political debate on security policy; 95 162.

OECD DAC Guidelines on Security System Reform and Governance (2004) 163 \u2018Core requirements of a well-functioning security system\u2019 Developing a nationally-owned concept of security and the policy and institu- tional frameworks states require to handle development and security as distinct but integrated areas of public action. Establishing well-defined policies and strengthening governance of the security institutions that are responsible for formulating, executing, managing and mon- itoring security policy. Building the institutional mechanisms for implementation and capacity throughout the security system; this includes ensuring that any development of professional security forces leads them to be both accountable to the civil author- ities and capable of carrying out the operational tasks asked of them. Strength- ening of a professional security system must be balanced and include the capac- ity building of civil control and supervision bodies in order to avoid any increase in the power and influence gap between military and civil bodies. PACE Recommendation 1713 (2005) 164 \u2018Democratic oversight of the security sector in member states\u2019 10. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, conscious of the fact that the proper functioning of democracy and respect for human rights are the Council of Europe\u2019s main concern, recommends that the Committee of Minis- ters prepare and adopt guidelines for governments setting out the political rules, standards and practical approaches required to apply the principle of democratic supervision of the security sector in member states, drawing on the following principles: i. Intelligence services a. the functioning of these services must be based on clear and appropriate leg- 96 163. Security System Reform and Gov- ernance.

        "a 5 islation supervised by the courts; b. each parliament should have an appropriately functioning specialised com- mittee. Supervision of the intelligence services\u2019 \u201cremits\u201d and budgets is a min- imum prerequisite; c. conditions for the use of exceptional measures by these services must be laid down by the law in precise limits of time; d. under no circumstances should the intelligence services be politicised as they must be able to report to policy makers in an objective, impartial and profes- sional manner. Any restrictions imposed on the civil and political rights of security personnel must be prescribed by the law; e. the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is called upon to adopt an European Code of Intelligence Ethics (in the same fashion as the European Code of Police Ethics adopted by the Council of Europe); f. the delicate balance between confidentiality and accountability can be man- aged to a certain extent through the principle of deferred transparency, that is to say by declassifying confidential material after a period of time prescribed by law; g. lastly, parliament must be kept regularly informed about general intelligence policy; ii. Police a. each state must set up its own specific legal framework for the functioning and supervision of a democratic police force. The credibility of the police will depend on its professionalism and the extent to which it operates in accor- dance with democratic rules and the utmost respect for human rights; b. given their different mandate and competences, it is important that legisla- tion distinguishes between security and intelligence services on the one hand and law enforcement agencies on the other; c. the police must remain neutral and not be subject to any political influence. Transparency is also important if the public is to have confidence in the police and co-operate with them; d. police officers must be given training covering humanitarian principles, con- stitutional safeguards and standards deriving from codes of ethics laid down by international organisations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OSCE; e. legislation in this area must take account of developments in modern tech- nologies and cybercrime and be updated regularly; f. police action against crime must show due regard for the principle of propor- tionality, particularly during public demonstrations where there is a signifi- cant risk of matters getting out of hand; 97 cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 97 ",
        "a 5 iii. Border management a. as a result of the rise in crime and terrorism, this sector must be subject to heightened democratic supervision and enhanced international co-opera- tion. Clear legislation is needed in this respect to prevent corruption, dis- crimination and excessive use of force; b. the principle of the free movement of persons must not be subject to unwar- ranted restrictions. However, our borders cannot be abused for reasons relat- ing to economic crime, trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and arms smuggling. Where State authorities consider that there is a threat to law and order and security and consequently apply the border protection clause, such measures should not be applied excessively or to groups or individuals whose presence is undesirable for ideological or political reasons only; c. border security must be provided by a centralised, hierarchical system based on clearly defined rules. Training and working and living conditions for bor- der guards must be organised in such a way as to protect them from the pres- sures of organised crime and corruption; iv. Defence a. national security is the armed forces\u2019 main duty. This essential function must not be diluted by assigning the armed forces auxiliary tasks, save in excep- tional circumstances; b. the increasing importance attached to international co-operation and peace- keeping missions abroad must not be allowed to have an adverse effect on the role of parliament in the decision-making process. Democratic legitimacy must take precedence over confidentiality; c. at European level, it is essential to avoid any step backwards in relation to the democratic achievements of the Western European Union Assembly by intro- ducing a system of collective consultation between national parliaments on security and defence issues; d. in this connection, national parliaments should continue to have an inter- parliamentary body to which the relevant European executive body would report and with which it would hold regular institutional discussions on all aspects of European security and defence; e. deployments of troops abroad should be in accordance with the United Nations Charter, international law and international humanitarian law. The conduct of the troops should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Interna- tional Criminal Court in The Hague; v.

Such regulations should include provisions on parliamentary oversight, monitoring mechanisms, licensing provisions and means to establish minimal requirements for the functioning of those private companies. 99 cc 80-Text.qxp 29/07/2005 10:55 Page 99 ",

        "With the European Union\u2019s 2004 round of enlargement, its neighbourhood now stretches from the Balkans to the Southern Caucasus, and from Russia to the Southern Mediterranean. This new neighbourhood suffers from serious deficits in terms of security, development and democracy, which constitute a serious challenge for the EU\u2019s own security. It is clear, however, that no genuine political and economic modernisation can be carried out as long as defence and security sectors remain unaccoun- table to civilian authorities, lack transparency and waste valuable national resources. This Chaillot Paper examines to what extent the EU is able to address the question of security sector reform and governance with its neighbours. Although increasingly engaged in the pro- motion of security sector governance, the EU has neither develo- ped a comprehensive policy framework, nor mainstreamed its manifold activities aimed at promoting security sector gover- nance. Moreover, it pursues the reform of security institutions such as police forces, border guards or judicial systems on a pie- cemeal basis, shying away from involving itself in defence-related aspects of security sector governance, even though ESDP opera- tions are increasingly dealing with post-conflict situations that require the reform and reintegration of military forces. The main policy recommendation advanced by this Chaillot Paper is that the EU should develop a holistic approach to pro- moting security sector governance in its neighbourhood. published by the European Union Institute for Security Studies 43 avenue du Pr\u00e9sident Wilson F-75775 Paris cedex 16 phone: +33 (0)1 56 89 19 30 fax: +33 (0)1 56 89 19 31 e-mail: institute@iss-eu.org www.iss-eu.org \u20ac 10 cc 80-coverDEF.qxp 29/07/2005 10:48 Page 4 "
