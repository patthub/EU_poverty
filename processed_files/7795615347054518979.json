        "Equal opportunities \u2013 the catch-up game ",
        "T he objective of equal opportunities for all European citizens has long been at the forefront of European social policy. \u2018Europe must work towards real equality in practice\u2019, said European Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Commissioner, Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla at the launch of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for Allin January of this year. But increasing globalisation, rapid demographic change and wide-scale economic developments have all placed new and diverse pressures on Europe\u2019s societies and application of anti-discrimination legislation has, claimed Commissioner \u0160pidla, encountered too many obstacles and delays. Increasing migration into the European Union and greater mobility between countries means that Member States have an increasingly diverse profile, transforming traditional class, social and often religious divisions. New patterns of family life have emerged; fewer people are being born but they are living longer and working harder than ever before. As a result, demands on housing, pensions and health and care facilities are rapidly reaching overload. Working and employment conditions have changed; people are working in new ways, within new types of organisations and with greater intensity. More women are in paid work outside the home but there has been little trade-off with their domestic responsibilities. Europe\u2019s policymakers have reacted by taking steps to best prepare its citizens to respond more effectively to these changing forces. The understanding is that driving towards more and better jobs and greater competitiveness will increase productivity and therefore prosperity, thereby improving the quality of life for all European citizens. But, importantly, the focus of policymakers at the highest levels has always been on all EU citizens. It is in this context that the Council of Ministers, when inviting the Commission to take stock of the social situation in the Union, called for particular emphasis to be placed on questions of access and opportunity. As the recent consultation paper from the Bureau of European Policy Advisers highlights, \u2018equal opportunity is a weak goal unless accompanied by strong efforts to ensure that all citizens have access to the resources, conditions and capabilities that make theoretical equality of opportunity real and meaningful\u2019. So what does that mean for Europe\u2019s ageing workforce? For women? For women with children? For unskilled workers? For people with disabilities or those who are chronically ill? For the new wave of migrants throughout the European Union? Foundation research has focused on all these areas and more over recent years. The previous issue of Foundation Focus took up the issue of age and employment. This issue looks at the major obstacles to accessing equal opportunities, highlights best practice where it exists and points to possible paths for policymakers as they look to a better, more \u2018equal\u2019 future for all citizens. This issue of Foundation Focus places the spotlight on equal opportunities, viewed in the light of recent policy developments at EU and national level and based on Foundation research findings in this area. The aim of the series is to explore a subject of social and economic policy importance and contribute to argument and debate on the key issues shaping the future of living and working conditions in Europe.

        "3 THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES \u2018In our view, \u201cequal opportunities\u201d is a broader and deeper concept than \u201cdiversity\u201d. Taking the \u201cdiversity\u201d approach, one quite rightly seeks to root out any form of discrimination against people. Employees mustn\u2019t be made to carry too heavy a burden on their shoulder. But equal opportunities, on the other hand, presuppose freedom. If one isn\u2019t free, one cannot take advantage of opportunities that life or the workplace offers. Equal opportunities call for an even deeper investment in a person\u2019s career,\u2019 says Catherine Ferrant. PROGRESS MADE AT TOTAL \u2018The most important step for our Group has been signing a European-wide social agreement on equal opportunities with European trade unions. The focus of this initiative in the first instance is on women and disabled people. It covers matters such as recruitment, training, functional mobility and salaries. We are progressively implementing a \u201cEuropean equal opportunities scorecard\u201d with documented indicators. These will enable us to identify and disseminate best practices and to monitor our progress in implementing equal opportunities. In 2005, we took a big step towards making our teams more gender-diverse and international by introducing tracking indicators and targets. For example, we set a goal of 12% women and 25% non- French employees in senior management by 2010, compared to 6% and 19% at the end of 2004.\u2019 THE MOST DISADVANTAGED GROUPS \u2018Disabled people generally tend to be exposed to discrimination in various ways, including lack of appropriate education and mobility problems. At Total, we work very hard to see how we can improve their career opportunities. People tend to accept the need to diversify the international makeup of our teams. But they\u2019re more sceptical about trying to increase the number of women, often for cultural or psychological reasons. There are still a lot of widely- held stereotypes to overcome, such as the role and image of women in companies and the so-called constraints that hinder their careers and mobility \u2013 even women believe them. In response, we\u2019ve developed awareness seminars that give both men and women the chance to examine and perhaps overcome these stereotypes. But there are outside obstacles as well. The oil industry is often perceived to be a difficult, men-only preserve. So we have to convince young women graduates that we offer professional challenges and career paths that they hadn\u2019t expected to be open to them.\u2019 EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND WORK\u2013LIFE BALANCE \u2018Work\u2013life balance policy is interesting because it supposes that not only mothers, but all employees, should benefit from a better balance between work and \u2018other life\u2019, and from a better involvement in their families. This is why we work very hard on this. We have created a 60-bed cr\u00e8che in Paris, and other projects are underway. We are also developing time management practices and personal services initiatives.\u2019 DIVERSITY, EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND THE LISBON AGENDA \u2018Diversity enhances employee relationships and stimulates performance, and when it spreads across a company, it\u2019s good for everyone. It\u2019s been proven that diverse teams are more creative, more innovative and more responsive, all valuable assets in an increasingly competitive world. But diversity is about more than competitiveness; it\u2019s also about fairness and credibility. We can\u2019t claim that all our employees are realising their full potential when our statistics show that relatively few women and non-French employees hold positions of responsibility. Society has changed. Our employees and the young graduates we hire live in a multicultural world, and they expect their workplace to reflect this.\u2019 FRANCE VS EUROPE, EUROPE VS OTHER REGIONS \u2018Europe is perhaps a pioneer in the field of equal opportunities, if we measure its excellence through the interest of Asian researchers and journalists for our models and initiatives. In France, we have the second-highest birth rate in Europe and, at the same time, also one of the highest rates of working mothers in Europe. This shows that a voluntary policy, with child-care facilities, parental leave etc. helps women to be at work, and fathers to share their family responsibilities!\u2019 \u2018Equal opportunities call for career investment\u2019 Catherine Ferrant, Vice President, Global Diversity and Accountability at the French oil and gas company, Total, outlines some of her views on this company\u2019s approach to equal opportunities. I N T E R V I E W Catherine Ferrant was born in Belgium in 1952. She holds degrees in economics and communications and began her professional career as a journalist at Le Soir, where she worked as editor of the politics, employment and business section. In 1989, she joined PetroFina as Vice President, Corporate Communications. In 2003, she was appointed Vice President, Global Diversity and Accountability, heading a new department created as part of Total\u2019s Human Resources and Corporate Communications Division. ",
        "C urrently, just over half of women (56.3%) are employed, well below the overall target for men and women of 70% set out in the Lisbon strategy. The employment rate for men is already above the target (71.3%), so strategies to provide more people with jobs must necessarily focus on the particular problems facing women when entering or rejoining the workforce. The main reason for this lower female employment rate is that women spend considerably more time on family and household responsibilities, making it difficult for them to participate fully in the labour market. Adapting European jobs to become more family friendly is, therefore, not only good for workers and their families, but in fact necessary to ensure progress towards the ambitious objectives of making Europe \u2018the most competitive economy in the world\u2019. Foundation research highlights the fact that the difference between the amount of unpaid work carried out by European men and women is huge. This is the case across all age groups, but it is particularly important for those aged 30 to 45, the years in which family responsibilities are most pressing (see Figure 1). According to Foundation estimates, European middle- aged female workers spend on average 20 to 25 more hours per week on care or housework duties than their male colleagues. This obviously has an impact on the number of paid working hours of men and women: whereas middle-aged men tend to work slightly longer hours than younger or older generations, women work fewer paid hours on average during the \u2018family- intensive\u2019 years, (see also Figure 1). The disproportionate amount of unpaid work carried out by women does not only impact on their paid working hours, but possibly more importantly, on their capacity or willingness to take on paid work at all. When comparing the employment rates of men and women, it becomes obvious that the family/household burden carried by women has a clear impact on their employment rates: it is during the years of family responsibilities (and disproportionate female unpaid working hours) where the gap between the employment rates of men and women is at its largest (see Figure 2). Furthermore, not only are middle-aged women less likely to work for pay than men: when they do work, they are much more likely to work part-time. It is clear, therefore, that any effort to increase employment rates in Europe involves tackling the so-called \u2018double burden\u2019 carried by women. A first strategy would be to tackle the source of the problem \u2013 the unequal distribution of unpaid work. This means attacking gender inequality even in the private sphere. Secondly, social policy can try to reduce the family/household burden by extending the social rights and basic public services that support families in their caring needs. Free or affordable provision of childcare and care for dependent adults can be a very effective way of reducing the burden of family Gender, time and work: a key to Lisbon\u2019s success A key element of the Lisbon strategy focuses on increasing Europe\u2019s employment rates in general. To do this effectively, concerted action is needed at EU and national level to boost the employment rates of women in particular.

        "5 responsibilities and thereby increasing the employment rates of women. Finally, in the context of the work\u2013life balance agenda, another approach would involve better adapting jobs to the demands outside the work place, so that workers (women, in particular) can mould their working time to their lives outside work. In terms of social policy, it means encouraging companies to offer jobs that are \u2018family- friendly\u2019. But what does that mean in practice? So far, it has essentially meant part-time work. Of all the working time arrangements that can be used to make jobs more adaptable to outside work demands, part- time work is by far the most widely used. The increase in part-time work is probably the most important development in European labour markets over the last 20 years, coinciding of course with the massive incorporation of women into employment. Part-time work is mainly a female phenomenon (almost 80% of EU part-timers are women), and again, it is most prevalent in those years in which the female family/household burden is most pressing. In this way, part-time work can be perceived as a \u2018family-friendly\u2019 type of work that may allow more women to integrate into the labour market. There is a correlation between the percentage of part- time work and the employment rate of women: in those countries with a higher percentage of part-time work, more women participate in the labour market (see Figure 3). But is part-time work the solution to the work\u2013life conflict faced by many women? Probably not, at least not in the way it is currently regulated and practised in most EU countries. Full-time work is still preferred by most people, and very often part-time work is simply the consequence of the lack of feasible alternatives for combining work and non-work demands (only 30% of EU part- timers say that they took a part-time job because \u2018they did not want a full-time job\u2019). What is more, research evidence points to a certain degree of discrimination against part-time workers in terms of career prospects, salary, job tenure and access to supplementary benefits in most EU countries. 1 Unless the conditions of part- time work are improved so that it can become a real and reasonable alternative to full-time work, it is likely to remain to a certain extent an involuntary and discriminatory working-time system. If part-time work is not the solution, therefore, one should consider how to make full-time work more flexible and adaptable to the personal needs of workers \u2013 particularly for European women carrying the burden of disproportionate family/household responsibilities. Recent research carried out by the Foundation 2 shows that there are three main difficulties in combining full-time work with family responsibilities: 1. First, the \u2018long hours\u2019 culture prevalent in some jobs often makes participation by women with family responsibilities difficult. For instance, evidence suggests that one of the main reasons behind the lower proportion of women in managerial positions is the very long working hours usually demanded of managers. 2. A second difficulty is the unpredictability of work schedules that affects some types of jobs (again, unpredictability is higher in managerial and professional occupations, and also in some sectors such as hotels and restaurants), placing them outside the scope of women with family responsibilities. Work schedules that are regular and predictable make it easier to combine full-time work and family life. 3. The final and probably most important difficulty in combining family and full- time work in Europe is the lack of access to flexible working-time arrangements. Most European jobs have rigid time schedules, with very limited possibilities for workers to adapt working times to their needs. According to the fourth European Working Conditions Survey , more than two thirds of European employees have fixed working schedules, with no possibilities for change; and according to the European Establishment Survey of Working Time , only around 13% of all European establishments offer advanced forms of flexible time arrangements such as working time accounts or annualised working hours. So there is no doubt there is room for improvement in this area, improvement which would have a substantial impact on the capacity of European workers (male and female) to adapt paid working hours to the demands of life outside work. An effective work\u2013life balance policy, based on long-term goals of gender equality, widespread access to child and adult care services, and more flexibility for workers to adapt their working times to the demands of their private lives, would certainly improve the lives of European women, while at the same time increasing overall employment rates and the productive capacity of the European economy.

        "6 D espite equal opportunities legislation, the quality of work and the career paths of women are still very different for women and men. Although collective agreements and minimum wage laws are in principle gender neutral, women generally still earn less than men. Part of the reason for this is that women are segregated in some sectors of the economy, taking up lower paid part- time jobs, resulting in far fewer women than men making it to top managerial positions. A WOMAN\u2019S WORTH The European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) Annual Pay Update provides data on collectively agreed pay across Europe. This includes data on gender pay differentials in the form of the \u2018unadjusted gender pay gap\u2019, that is the difference between gross hourly pay of men and women across the whole economy. 1 Figure 1 shows, that when looking at the unadjusted figures, quite a wide \u2013 although narrowing \u2013 hourly pay gap still exists throughout Europe. Moreover, the figures show that the move towards narrowing wage disparities is progressing only slowly in the EU15 and Norway: it decreased by 2.3% from 20.4% in 2001 to 18.1% in 2005. In 2004\u20135 even this trend was broken, with an actual upturn in the hourly pay gap in the EU15. In the new Member States, hourly pay is somewhat more equitable and the gap there oscillated at around 17% in the years 2003 to 2005. According to EIRO Pay Developments 2005 , the lowest hourly wage pay gap is found in Malta (4%), while the widest gap is in Germany (26%) \u2013 see Figure 2. This mirrors the situation reported in the 2004 EIRO Pay Developments update. Maltese data should however be interpreted with care as the overall participation rate of women in the labour market is very low in that country. Other countries consistently reporting relatively narrow gender pay gaps are Slovenia (6.9%), Denmark (10.1%) and Ireland (13.3%), while those with comparatively wide gaps include Greece (25.2%), Cyprus (25%), Czech Republic (25.1%) and Slovakia (23.7%). Hourly wage differentials are accentuated by the unequal distribution of income between women and men in the workforce. Data from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) 2005 shows that women tend to be concentrated in the lowest income brackets. AND NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET\u2026 European labour markets are also highly segregated according to the results of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey . Only 26% of Europeans work in mixed occupations, where the workforce is composed of both sexes in the ratio of at least 40%:60%. Half of all working women work in only two sectors \u2013 34% in education and health and 17% in wholesale and retail trade. In comparison, half of the jobs occupied by men are spread across three sectors: manufacturing (22%), wholesale and retail (14%) and construction (13%), thus confirming the horizontal segregation existing in the labour market. Even in the sectors with a large female workforce, women often find themselves in the low- paid jobs. Out of those working in the education and health sectors up to 55% of men receive high pay, as compared to only 27% of women. This serves to further highlight the issue of vertical segregation in the labour market, or in other words, representation of women in managerial posts. Nevertheless, over the last 10 years, the EWCS has identified the slow, but steady, increase in the proportion of female bosses in the European Union: from 20% in 1995, to 23% in 2000 to 25% in 2005. However, this rate is still much \u2018Mind the gap\u2019 \u2013 Quality of work for women and men The number of women in paid jobs has increased steadily in recent years. In some sectors, women appear to have benefited most from new jobs being created. But while they may have increased their foothold in the employment market, they still generally earn less than men in equivalent jobs and they still tend to climb the career ladder more slowly, if at all.

        "7 lower than in the United States, where the equivalent figure is 37%. 2 There are also substantial differences between the countries when it comes to representation of women in the managerial ranks (see Figure 3). The highest proportion of women in supervisory positions is found in northern and eastern European countries (reaching almost 40% in Finland and Estonia), with the lowest proportion in the southern European and some continental countries (e.g. Germany, Italy and Luxembourg). Although the increase in the number of women in managerial posts is a positive development, it is not straightforward. Most female bosses have female subordinates. Whereas less than 10% of men have women as their immediate bosses, around 43% of working women in Europe have female bosses. Women also are more likely to be managers of part-timers \u2013 41% of part- timers have female bosses compared to 21% of full-timers. Both men and women in part- time employment are more likely to be managed by a woman. Also the proportion of female bosses diminishes in higher management positions (when taking the number of subordinates as an indicator for the level of management responsibility). Female managers are concentrated in sectors and workplaces with a predominantly female/part-time workforce at the lower end of hierarchies. NOT WORKING 9 TO 5\u2026 Vertical and horizontal segregation of women is only part of the story. Concentration of women in the lower pay bracket can be explained in part by over- representation of women in part-time positions (see Figure 4), which are mostly lower paid. According to the EWCS, the gender time gap \u2013 the difference between men and women\u2019s contributions to the labour market in terms of working time \u2013 shows that in the EU27 there is a much higher proportion of women than men working part time (29% and 7% respectively). Working part time has significant consequences on pay. Between 70% and 80% of employees working part time fall into the low-pay category. However, within the subset of part-time workers, the distribution of low pay is quite even between men and women. When looking at the differences in pay between men and women in full-time jobs, a similar pattern emerges: overall, men tend to be overrepresented at the upper end of the income distribution scale and there are roughly twice as many women than men among those on low pay. While more women than men tend to work part time, there are twice as many men as women working long hours. According to the fourth European Working Conditions Survey , 14.9% of EU27 employees work more than 48 hours a week. When considering the gender difference in terms of working long hours, 20% of all male workers work long hours as compared to 8.5% of all female employees. WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME It is increasingly clear that having a family also has a very real impact on the choice of working hours. Working fathers are less likely to work part-time compared to non- fathers (by around 50%). For working women, by contrast, parenthood often leads to part-time work. Both trends contribute to the growing incidence of \u2018one and a half\u2019 worker households with a full-time working father and a part-time working mother. It is also the case that working fathers tend to work longer weekly hours as their parental responsibilities grow. Working fathers with two children under 16 work over two hours more each week than men without children in their main paid jobs. Only for those fathers with extended family responsibilities (three or more children) is there a slight fall-off in weekly working hours. The opposite is the case for working mothers who work fewer hours than women without children, though this is largely due to the increased incidence of part-time work by working mothers. The average weekly hours of full-time working mothers actually increase as their number of children increases.

        "8 JUGGLING ACT On the assumption that working women are largely responsible for unpaid home and caring activities \u2013 an assumption soundly supported by evidence from the Working Conditions Survey \u2013 a key focus in the work\u2013 life balance debate has been on the specific pressures placed on working women. It is interesting therefore to note that men seem more dissatisfied with their work\u2013life fit than women. The main factors contributing to this unexpected outcome are the volume of weekly working hours and the different ways in which working hours are organised between men and women, rather than gender per se. In general, part- time workers are twice as likely to have a positive perception of their work\u2013life balance as full-time workers. The high incidence of female part-time work and low incidence of male part-time work are therefore key factors differentiating the levels of satisfaction with work\u2013life fit of working men and women. That said, even among those working full-time, a somewhat higher proportion of men (24% versus 20%) is unhappy with their work\u2013life fit. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS Although issues relating to the gender pay gap are mostly regarded as a matter of national legislation and politics, some aspects of gender pay equity have been a subject of collective bargaining. There is an ongoing debate whether collective agreements counter or prolong existing gender pay gaps. On the one hand, collective bargaining is a good mechanism to identify and combat discrimination but it can also preserve elements contributing to persistent pay differences. In principle, the social partners recognise the existence of the gender pay gap, as was reflected by signing Frameworks of Action for Gender Equality, a cross-sectoral accord of the European social partners in May 2005. However, in their capacity as parties to collective bargaining, the social partners often disagree on the best strategy to follow in order to address the issue \u2013 compulsory measures, collective regulations or individual arrangements. In general, employer organisations consider legislation and regulation in the area of gender equality as counterproductive, and would prefer tailor-made company-level solutions. Many employers would also prefer to include gender issues as part of wider diversity policies. The trade unions tend to have a different view and prefer general regulation to individual solutions. They also tend to take active measures in the field of gender mainstreaming in general and regarding the gender pay gap in particular. These include organising events to raise public awareness, conducting research, provision of training courses on negotiating for equal pay or training using a model agreement on equal pay. They also implement procedures to combat gender discrimination. Apart from implementing legislation allowing for equal pay for equal work or work of equivalent value, some \u2019proactive\u2018 measures have been put in place by the social partners: (cid:129) fighting the gender pay gap by providing additional pay increases to female-dominated/and or low-paid sectors through central level negotiations; FIGURE 4: Incidence of part-time work by sex (%) Source: Fourth European Working Conditions Survey (2007) CH NL UKNO BE LU SE IE AT DK EU DE IT FR ES TR MT PL EL RO FI CZ EE LT HU BG LV PT CY SI HR SK 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 male female ",

Moreover, women tend to be segregated in the labour market in certain sectors and a vast majority work in part- time jobs, which are often low paid. Moreover, there are further work-related consequences for women resulting from the gender pay gap that accumulate over the life course. Due to the part-time nature of their work, women might not be covered by collective agreements in which yearly wage increases are negotiated for the full-time workers. Also, lower wages translate into lower social security and pension contributions and possibly less access to supplementary pension schemes. Although social partners have taken some action to facilitate greater gender equality, the issue could still be higher on the collective bargaining agenda. Perhaps the conclusion of a framework agreement at European level could further that process and stimulate real action. Further research needs to be done to better understand women\u2019s early career choices \u2013 what attracts women to certain occupations and sectors. In addition, it would be interesting to see what particular skills and personal characteristics are attractive to employers who offer higher pay and to enable young women to develop these skills. Finally, more research examining the dynamics of the gender pay gap over the life course would help to determine where the pay gap starts and how it impacts on other policy areas, such as education and social and personal services.

The business operations are Bayer HealthCare, Bayer CropScience, Bayer MaterialScience. Central service functions are pooled into three service companies. The preparatory vocational training programme \u2018Start aid\u2019 for young people is run by Bayer Industry Services (BIS). The preparatory vocational training programme is specifically developed for young people who are disadvantaged in terms of learning and social background. The key motivation for the initiative is corporate social responsibility and the role of the company as a major local player. The programme creates perspectives for less well-qualified school leavers. Without such measures the participants are strongly at risks of exclusion from the labour market. In 1988/89, the initiative \u2018Start aid\u2019 began with five participants at the BIS premises in Dormagen with the involvement of the works council. It was extended to all five BIS locations. The number of participants increased to 50 in 1991, 75 in 2001 and 175 in 2004. The increase of 100 in 2004 is related to a decrease of 100 for the 800 regular apprenticeships, based on an agreement with the works council. The reduction of places for regular apprenticeship was related to increasing problems to take on the apprentices permanently after their vocational training. Participants are recruited annually through the regular selection procedure for apprentices. In 2006 the company received 10,000 applications and 6,000 applicants were invited to an aptitude test. Of these, 2,500 were interviewed, with a focus on knowledge, motivation and suitability. In each interview, there are three persons from the company involved. 875 applicants were selected of which 175 are taking part in the \u2018Start aid\u2019 programme. 55% of the participants are male and 45% female. The majority of participants have a secondary school leaving certificate, although some have no school leaving certificate at all. Around a third (30%) of participants come from immigrant backgrounds. The training takes one year and is an entry qualification for an apprenticeship in various occupations such as chemical production technicians or for a technical or administrative job. The programme combines instruction to improve basic educational skills with elements of practical and theoretical vocational training, including training in social skills such as team work, communication and self-discipline. A key factor for success \u2013 besides the intense selection procedure \u2013 is intensive coaching of the participants during the entire period of training. Another important aspect is career advice to help participants choose a particular occupation. The company developed the initiative independently. The programme requires higher expenditure than for the regular apprentices. Around 4.2 million euro are invested in the programme annually. The entire measure is financed by the company. The intensive coaching and attention leads to a success rate of almost 90% of participants being offered an apprenticeship contract at Bayer or other companies.

        "10 O n a wider scale, in some countries throughout the European Union more people of working age are in receipt of disability benefits than are in unemployment schemes. Of course the employment situation and administrative procedures influence these numbers but the figures tell their own story. Boosting employment rates across Europe is a well-known objective of the Lisbon Strategy. Integrating more women and retaining older workers in the labour market are key elements in ensuring this increased participation across the Union. But integrating people with disabilities into the workforce should have an equally important place in this drive to improve employment participation for all European citizens. DISABILITY AND EXCLUSION Increasingly, disability has been seen as a major cause of exclusion. Foundation research confirms that those excluded by ill- health or disability from employment \u2013 or indeed whose opportunities in the workforce are restricted by disability \u2013 are more likely to be at risk of poverty and social exclusion and to experience a diminished quality of life. European Union reports focus not only on disability or ill-health as a barrier to employment but also as a cause of early exit from employment. The European Council has identified disabled people as a priority for increased labour market participation, but so far attention has been given more to people with physical rather than with mental health problems. The concept of \u2018longstanding health problem or disability\u2019 (LSHPD) was employed for the Labour Force Survey Module implemented in 2002, which provides basic information on the distribution of disability among people aged 16\u201364 in the Member States. The results indicate little difference in the rates of LSHPD between men and women of working age but show a clear increase in incidence with age. About 30% of people aged 55 to 64 reports some disability, and this proportion is higher in the new Member States, as is the reported severity of the disability. Research shows clearly that disabled people often find themselves on the margins of the job market; for people with disabilities, for example, employment rates are usually lower than those for older workers. Yet 45 million people of working age are estimated to have longstanding health problems or disability - one in six people of the labour force age groups in Europe. Data on the scale and significance of disability for employment are difficult to collect and compare across Europe as self-reporting rates are very different across Member States, and, in the 2002 survey, only 10% of people with LSHPD reported a mental, nervous or emotional problem. Furthermore, Member States have employed varying definitions and criteria for disability assessment according to different policy objectives, legislation, and administrative needs. PREVENTING EXCLUSION To get a clear picture of disability and work, it is important to appreciate that most people with disability were not born with it nor did they acquire it as a result of an occupational injury or accident (see Figure below). Fewer than one in six people report the onset of their disability as being work- related. On the other hand, most people of working age with a disability have acquired it during the course of their working life which means, therefore, most people with disabilities have work experience. The first step to prevent exclusion from employment is thus to retain links to work for those who become ill or disabled. Indeed just under half of people of working age with some level of disability are employed compared with two-thirds of those without disability. This relatively low employment rate of people with disabilities indicates, for the most part, low levels of Integration of people with disabilities into the European workforce In the United Kingdom, over two million people receive disability benefits. Nearly half of these people say they would prefer to be at work. In some areas, the rates are even higher; for example, in Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, one in five adults are in receipt of incapacity benefit. R E S E A R C H FIGURE 1: Causes of longstanding health problem or disability (LHSPD) Source: Eurostat, Statistics in Focus, Theme 3 \u2013 26/2003, Employment of disabled people in Europe in 2002 Born with it or birth injury Do not know Non-work-related diseases Household, leisure and sports accident or injury Traffic accident or injury (outside of work) Work-related accident or injury, incl. traffic accidents at work Work-related diseases ",
        "11 retention and reintegration following accident or illness in working life. There are big differences, however, between Member States, so that fewer than one quarter of people with a disability are employed in Hungary and Latvia, while more than half of those with a disability are employed in Denmark, France, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. Rates of unemployment or inactivity of people with disability are much higher for those recorded as \u2018severely disabled\u2019: 78% were outside the labour force in 2002. Clearly, starting points to improve the situation of people with disabilities are different across the Member States, as are their capacities to implement changes. But they all face similar challenges to modernise social protection structures and to activate labour market support. In many Member States, for example, new measures have been introduced to increase conditionality for the receipt of benefits. This is only one component, however, of a more comprehensive strategy required to ensure the provision of incentives and support to return to, or remain in, employment. Active labour market measures in several Member States already include opportunities to upgrade skills, address educational disadvantage, and provide appropriate counselling services, because it is now increasingly recognised that successful measures in this area involve personal and high-quality support, extending beyond access to employment to measures to maintain people in work. SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT MEASURES This emphasis on sustainable employment underlines the need to address barriers not only in access to jobs for people with disabilities but in the workplace itself. Many workers with disabilities have experienced discrimination in the workplace, the result often of negative, sometimes ill-informed, perceptions of their conditions. In particular, the stigma experienced by those with mental health problems gives real cause for concern. And negative attitudes such as these are not confined to other workers and managers but can also be found even among those in the health and human resource professions faced with addressing often highly complex personnel issues. There is no doubt the retention or return to work of people with chronic health problems is a multifaceted and often highly complex issue. But for this reason it underlines the need for a highly coordinated and focused response from both companies and public authorities or services. REMOVING BARRIERS Most workers with disabilities aim to find jobs on the open labour market. But for this to be a real possibility, there is clearly a need to work towards removing the existing barriers in work through work adaptations and more flexible and transitional work arrangements. Indeed, for some more severely disabled people, this would require specially organised workplaces. Effective implementation of the EU Employment Equality Directive is likely to make a major contribution to improving employment opportunities for people with more severe disabilities. But it is not only legislation that plays a role in this context. Active measures for integration and retention of employment depend on a wide range of interventions from both inside and outside the workplace. External services include rehabilitation, training and employment services. Some groups excluded by ill-health will also require cooperation and support from services such as housing and social security. To ensure a coherent and effective approach, these services then need to cooperate and coordinate more effectively with in-work services. What is clear is that systematic planning and allocation of responsibility to workplace and community services is required to ensure the effective and sustainable integration into employment of workers with disabilities. Through its work, the Foundation itself has consistently emphasised the importance of appropriate counselling services for workers both in and outside employment, as well as enhanced coordination between services in the workplace. EARLY INTERVENTION To address this area of disability, different management models have been developed over recent years. These tend to incorporate measures to both promote and maintain employee health, with particular focus on lifestyles and working conditions. When workers become ill, for example, intervention at an early stage to monitor absence from work and to provide encouragement for return to work can help offset long-term implications. In this way, the focus is on early prevention in order to manage the relevant risks as they emerge. Moreover, the disability management model emphasises the need for case management for long-term absent employees, emphasising the timely coordination of services. As initiatives in Member States and at European level underline, therefore, there is still a very real need to develop awareness around the issue of disability and employment on a general basis. At the same time, at the level of management and professionals, there must be an explicit strengthening of disability management through skills development and training as well as implementation. Some active integration measures have already proved successful in a number of Member States. Building on these successes will facilitate the integration of some of the more neglected groups amongst those with disability into Europe\u2019s labour market \u2013 and help keep them there.

        "12 A decco is a world leader in human resource solutions, with a comprehensive service that includes temporary and contract staffing, outsourcing, permanent recruitment, outplacement and career services, training and consulting. Adecco Italy was set up in 1997 and with its 500 agencies across the country it has become a key market player. The workforce numbers around 2,000 employees (of which 70% are women), it has 18,000 companies as its clients and offers work to more then 33,000 people. In February 2001, in order to promote the employment of people at risk of exclusion, Adecco set up the Adecco Foundation for Equal Opportunities. From the beginning, this Foundation developed special programmes to emphasise human potential and the training of people with disabilities. Throughout Adecco\u2019s agencies network, many companies have become involved, often going beyond the national legislation. The main law in question \u2013 Law no 68/99 \u2013 states that every company with more than 15 employees has to take on persons with a disability. This includes those with a reduced capacity to work of 45% or more, persons who are at least 33% disabled, the blind or deaf-mute and war victims. Companies, however, can get dispensation from this law and not every category of disability is protected by it. From 2001 to 2005, a total of 2,818 people with disabilities were integrated into the labour market; so far, 90% of them have an open-ended contract. Subsequently, the Adecco Foundation broadened its programmes to include other groups at risk, namely, the long-term unemployed, single mothers and athletes at the end of their competitive careers. By means of Adecco\u2019s set-up and know-how, the Adecco Foundation has been able to develop ways to facilitate access to employment for those people most at risk of exclusion. The various methods used by Adecco \u2013 for example, motivational analysis and vocational training courses \u2013 are key elements to its success. The fact that the social circumstances of the long-term unemployed are very much taken into consideration is also a very important aspect of the training sessions. The long- term unemployed often feel excluded from society as a whole and have little self- confidence. Through an analysis of their motivations and skills, they become conscious of their capacities and competences. The training programmes are diverse and may consist of individual interviews or group sessions (for example, training focusing on team-building). Beginning with the personal demands of the participant, a training course will be identified that allows for a reassessment of the technical competencies that they already possess, adapting them to the evolution of today\u2019s labour market. By means of the training sessions, the worker at risk of exclusion can find their way back into work and society. From 2001 till the end of 2004, the Adecco agency network helped 47,577 persons at risk of exclusion re-enter the labour market. Of those 47,577 workers, 35,482 were aged over 40; almost 4,000 were long-term unemployed; about 6,000 were single mothers and almost 2,000 were persons with disabilities. The long-term unemployed mainly found work in the service sector (47%) and the manufacturing sector (45%).

        "CRITICISING THE YEAR OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES \u2018The focus has been on making women and men equal. If there is a clear inequality of outcome in terms of pay, jobs or decision- making, we want women to do that equally. But our general criticism of equal opportunities is that it\u2019s not good enough for citizens to be equal before the law. There needs to be equality in practice. You have to take their other circumstances into consideration, like family life. The question is how to equip people so they can enjoy equal opportunities?\u2019 A FAIR AND JUST EUROPE Asked why we have to strive for equal opportunities, she responds: \u2018The EU is striving to be a fair and just community. If you\u2019re in favour of a fair and just society you have to provide equal opportunities.\u2019 She contrasts what she calls the conservative/neoliberal approach that everyone should have the same opportunity with what she sees as the social democratic or socialist approach and answers her own opening question: \u2018People don\u2019t have the same starting positions.\u2019 FLEXIBILITY, GENDER AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES Ms Passchier sees flexibility and equal opportunities as interlinked. \u2018Everyone needs flexibility. Workers need to reconcile work and family life. Women find it harder to reconcile mainstream work and family life \u2013 they pay with precarious working conditions.\u2019 Meanwhile, men lose out by having less opportunity to enjoy family life. It is not enough to look at equal opportunities on the individual level, she says. Broader societal issues need to be addressed, such as childcare provision and working time regulations. SOUNDS NICE \u2013 BUT WHAT\u2019S THE REALITY? Catelene Passchier recalls that the social partners made positive declarations during a year dedicated to disability. She asks: \u2018But did the policy lead to practice?\u2019 Race, she notes, was addressed in the 1995 Florence declaration combating racism in the workplace. It, too, was a good declaration. \u2018But how do you get implementation?\u2019 she challenges. Race is increasingly on the agenda again, she says. It is a high priority. She applauds some good work that has been done, citing an initiative by UNISON trade union members in northwest England which promoted social cohesion and helped people to work together while respecting differences. DIFFERENT POLICIES NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS There is no one policy that will improve equal opportunities all round. Different policies are required, for instance, in tackling discrimination against gay and lesbian persons from those addressing disability. And different policies again are required to eliminate discrimination against ethnic minorities or on the grounds of religion. The Confederal Secretary challenges the business argument that equal opportunity policies are too costly and therefore not attainable. \u2018We need a lot of people with different inputs to form the knowledge society.\u2019 VARIOUS LEVELS OF SUCCESS She believes that tackling gender discrimination has perhaps met with most success, while the ethnic minority ground is least well developed. She sees the removal of discrimination against ethnic minorities as an issue of major importance for Europe. There is major scope for action in supporting ethnic minorities and improving their working conditions, she says. \u2018Some trade unions and organisations need to change their culture to be more accepting of a diverse workforce. The fact that people are discriminated against on the grounds of their sexual orientation is often forgotten. It\u2019s still an area of taboo,\u2019 she maintains. \u2018The issue needs to be put on the agenda, awareness needs to be raised, ETUC needs to bring things into the open. Again, some trade unions and members still need to realise that it\u2019s an issue to address.\u2019 A DRIVING FORCE FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES \u2018Trade unions constitute an important driving force for equal treatment and equal opportunities for workers \u2013 not just this year,\u2019 she emphasises. The social partners play an important role in the formulation of collective agreements, which she sees as more just and more effective than when individual workers need to fight for themselves. 13 I N T E R V I E W \u2018Not everybody starts from the same position\u2019 Trying to define equal opportunities is not an easy task, says Catelene Passchier, Confederal Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). \u2018On the one hand, the term \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 is clear \u2013 providing people with equal opportunities in life. But are people equal in their starting positions?\u2019 she asks. Catelene Passchier \u2013 Confederal Secretary of ETUC (European Trade Union Confederation) since May 2003. Catelene Passchier was born in the Netherlands. She trained and worked as a lawyer and barrister before becoming legal adviser to the Netherlands trade union confederation FNV in 1988. Catelene Passchier\u2019s current areas of responsibilities in ETUC include gender equality and anti-discrimination, migration and integration as well as policy and legislation. ",
        "14 M obility is being encouraged in the European Union to enhance economic growth and productivity. But increasing numbers of workers migrating within and from outside the European Union have confronted national and local policymakers with a challenge: what supporting policies need to be implemented to make migration and integration successful? European cities and, in particular, major cities with strong economies, attract immigrants from all over the world. These cities already possess a rich experience of how to integrate a highly heterogeneous and culturally diverse population into the local community. They are also centres of competence in developing and implementing strategies for integration and improved participation of immigrants and ethnic minorities. However, migrants are also often at risk of suffering from social exclusion. A number of factors contribute to this: precarious job structures, barriers to obtaining recognised qualifications, insufficient education, lack of language skills and large differences in cultural and social practices between the country of origin and the receiving countries. It is the cities and municipalities that pay the price for failing integration processes and social exclusion \u2013 even though they are not in the position to regulate immigration flows themselves and despite the fact that they depend on national and federal legislation in all immigration-related issues. For this reason, cities and municipalities have a genuine interest in successful local integration practices. The CLIP network brings together more than 25 large European cities in a joint learning process which will extend over several years. It aims to support the social and economic integration and full participation of migrants, and to combat social inequalities and discrimination against migrants, not only in the labour market but in all key aspects of life. This includes providing equal access to schooling, housing, health and social services and creating conditions leading to peaceful coexistence between migrants and the native population as well as helping migrants to preserve their own cultural identity. Many cities have come up with innovative and working solutions for the problems they face but they have lacked a forum that allows for continuous exchange, especially concerning good practice, and scientific backup to evaluate the success of implemented policies and to recommend new approaches. CLIP provides this. TOPICS The network operates in a modular way. In each module, one specific issue relevant to the integration of migrants on the local level will be discussed. The first two modules already taken up by the network are the access to, and quality and affordability of housing for migrants as well as the effects of spatial segregation and diversity policy in cities. This consists in particular of looking at how social services are provided and at the internal personnel policy of cities, including access to employment for migrants and anti- discrimination policies. Other topics may include: (cid:129) inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue; (cid:129) supporting entrepreneurship of migrants; (cid:129) support for education for migrants from cr\u00e8che and pre-school to third level education; (cid:129) access and quality of health care for migrants; (cid:129) cultural integration policies (language, religion, culture of country of origin, sports); (cid:129) promotion of civic and political participation of migrants; (cid:129) situation of undocumented migrants; (cid:129) private security and violence in the community; (cid:129) local labour market policies including training and re-training for migrants CITIES PARTICIPATING IN THE CLIP NETWORK Amsterdam, Antwerp, Arnsberg, Athens, Deputaci\u00f3n de Barcelona, Bratislava, Breda, Brescia, Bucharest, Budapest, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt am Main, Istanbul, Izmir, Li\u00e8ge, Lisbon, Luxembourg, Marseille, Prague, Paris, Sefton, Stuttgart, Terrassa, Turku, Vienna, Wolverhampton, Zagreb Hubert Krieger Successful integration means equal access and participation To support the social and economic integration and full participation of migrants in European cities, the Foundation launched the Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies (CLIP) in spring 2006.
