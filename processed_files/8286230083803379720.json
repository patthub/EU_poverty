        "ANNEX The target secondary variables and identifiers for the 2019 module on intergenerational transmission of disadvantages, household composition and evolution of income, part of the cross-sectional component of EU-SILC, shall be as follows: 1. Units Information on intergenerational transmission of disadvantages variables shall be provided for all current household members or, if applicable, for all selected respondents aged over 24 years and less than 60 years. Information on evolution of income and household composition applies at household level and refers to the household as a whole. 2. Mode of data collection For variables applying to the individual level, the mode of data collection is a personal interview with all current household members or, if applicable, for all selected respondents aged over 24 years and less than 60 years. For variables applying to household level, the mode of data collection is personal interview with the household respondent. If the relevant persons are temporarily absent or incapacitated, proxy interviews are allowed as an exception. 3. Reference period For variables concerning intergenerational transmission of disadvantages , the reference period shall be when the interviewee was around 14 years old. For variables concerning evolution of income and household composition (household grid), the reference period shall be the current period. 4. Definitions for intergenerational transmission of disadvantages (1) Father: the person the interviewee considered to be his/her father when he/she was around 14 years old. In general the father will be the biological father, but if the interviewee considers someone else to be the father during the reference period, the answers should refer to him, even if the biological father was alive and known. (2) Mother: the person the interviewee considered to be his/her mother when he/she was around 14 years old. In general the mother will be the biological mother, but if the interviewee considers someone else to be the mother during the reference period, the answers should refer to her, even if the biological mother was alive and known. (3) Household: refers to the household in which the respondent was living when he/she was around 14 years old. If the parents of the respondent were divorced/separated and shared custody equally (50 % of the time for each parent), the respondent has the option to: \u2014 select his/her household on an objective basis , taking into account his/her main address when he/she was around 14 years old (i.e. the one in the population register and/or in his/her identity card/passport); \u2014 select his/her household on a subjective basis according to where he/she felt more at home when he/she was around 14 years old. If the parents of the respondent were divorced/separated and did not share custody equally, the household should be that where the respondent lived all or the majority of the time. The target secondary variables shall be sent to the Commission (Eurostat) in the Household Data File (H-file) and in the Personal Data File (P-file) after the target primary variables. 6.2.2018 L 32/36 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
