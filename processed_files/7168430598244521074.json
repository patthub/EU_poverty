        "I (Legislative acts) DIRECTIVES DIRECTIVE 2011/72/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 September 2011 amending Directive 2000/25/EC as regards the provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Directive 2000/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2000 on action to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by engines intended to power agricultural or forestry tractors ( 3 ) regulates exhaust emissions from engines installed in agricultural and forestry tractors with a view to further safeguarding human health and the environment. Directive 2000/25/EC provided that the emission limits applicable in 2010 for type approval of the majority of compression ignition engines, referred to as Stage III A, were to be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits, entering into force progressively as from 1 January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market, and from 1 January 2010 as regards the type-approval for those engines. Stage IV, providing for emission limits more stringent than Stage III B, will enter into force progressively as of 1 January 2013 as regards the type-approval for those engines and as of 1 January 2014 with regard to the placing on the market. (2) The transition to Stage III B involves a step change in technology requiring significant implementation costs for re-designing the engines and for developing advanced technical solutions. However, the current global financial and economic crisis or any economic downturn should not lead to a lowering of environ\u00ad mental standards. This revision of Directive 2000/25/EC should therefore be considered to be exceptional. Furthermore, investments in environmentally friendly technologies are important for the promotion of future growth, jobs and health security. (3) Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a flexibility scheme to allow tractor manufacturers to purchase, during a given stage, a limited number of engines that do not comply with emission limits applicable during that stage, but which are approved in accordance with the requirements of the stage immediately preceding the applicable one. (4) Since 2005, Directive 2000/25/EC has provided for the evaluation of the possible need for additional flexibilities in relation to Stages III B and IV emission limits. In order to provide temporary relief to the industry when moving to the next stage, it is necessary to adapt the conditions for applying the flexibility scheme. (5) During Stage III B, the number of tractors that are placed on the market and that enter into service should, in each engine category, not exceed 40 % of the number of tractors placed on the market by the tractor manu\u00ad facturer in that engine category. The alternative option of allowing a fixed number of tractors to be placed on the market and to enter into service under the flexibility scheme should be adapted accordingly. (6) Manufacturers of tractors falling within the scope of this Directive should benefit from European financial support programmes or any relevant support programmes provided by Member States. Those support programmes may favour projects employing the best available tech\u00ad nologies with the highest emission standards.

        "(7) Directive 2000/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. (8) The measures provided for in this Directive reflect a temporary difficulty faced by the industry. As such, the application of those measures should be restricted to the duration of Stage III B. (9) Current emission limits should be made more stringent, including with respect to ultrafine black carbon particles notably by introducing particulate number limits in future legislation if this is justified by relevant impact assessments, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Amendments to Directive 2000/25/EC Directive 2000/25/EC is hereby amended as follows: (1) in Article 1, the following indents are added: \u2018\u2014 \u201cflexibility scheme\u201d means the exemption procedure by means of which a Member State permits the placing on the market and entry into service of a limited number of tractors in accordance with the requirements laid down by Article 3a, \u2014 \u201cengine category\u201d means the classification of engines which combines the power range with the stage of exhaust emission limits, \u2014 \u201cmaking available on the market\u201d means any supply of a tractor or engine for distribution or use on the Union market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge, \u2014 \u201cplacing on the market\u201d means the first making available on the market of a tractor or engine, \u2014 \u201centry into service\u201d means the first use, for its intended purpose, in the Union of a tractor or engine. The date on which it is registered, if applicable, or placed on the market shall be considered the date of entry into service.\u2019; (2) Article 3a is replaced by the following: \u2018Article 3a Flexibility scheme By way of derogation from Article 3(1) and (2), Member States shall provide that, at the request of the tractor manu\u00ad facturer, and on condition that the approval authority has granted the relevant permit for placing on the market in accordance with the procedures laid down in Annex IV, a limited number of tractors fitted with engines approved in accordance with the requirements of the emission limits stage immediately preceding the applicable one may enter into service. The flexibility scheme shall begin when a given stage becomes applicable and shall have the same duration as the stage itself. The flexibility scheme set out in section 1.2 of Annex IV shall, however, be restricted to the duration of Stage III B or to three years where no subsequent stage exists.\u2019; (3) Annex IV is replaced by the text appearing in the Annex to this Directive.

        "DECISIONS DECISION No 940/2011/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 September 2011 on the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations (2012) (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Article 147(1) of the Treaty on the Func\u00ad tioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union is to contribute to a high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States and by supporting and, if necessary, complementing their action. (2) Pursuant to Article 153(1) TFEU, the Union is to support and complement the activities of the Member States on working conditions, the integration of persons excluded from the labour market and the combating of social exclusion. (3) Pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is, inter alia, to combat social exclusion and discrimination and is to promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men and solidarity between generations. (4) Article 174 TFEU recognises that some regions of the Union suffer from severe and permanent demographic handicaps that may adversely affect their level of devel\u00ad opment and require particular attention if the Union is to achieve the objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion. (5) Pursuant to Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life. (6) Ageing is undoubtedly a challenge for the whole of society and for all generations in Europe, and it is also a matter for intergenerational solidarity and for the family. (7) The part of the population of the Union comprised of people in their late 50s and over will increase at a much faster rate than ever before. This is very positive as it is a logical consequence of the improvement in health and the quality of life. Nevertheless, due to this demographic change, the Union faces a number of challenges. (8) Successive European Councils have recognised the need to tackle the effect of ageing populations on European social models. A key response to this rapid change in the age structure consists in promoting the creation of a culture of active ageing as a lifelong process and thus ensuring that the rapidly-growing population comprised of people who are currently in their late 50s and over, who are, on the whole, healthier and better educated than any such age group before them, have good oppor\u00ad tunities for employment and active participation in social and family life, including through volunteering, lifelong learning, cultural expression and sports. (9) Active ageing is, according to the World Health Organi\u00ad sation, the process of optimising opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age. Active ageing allows people to realise EN 23.9.2011 Official Journal of the European Union L 246/5 ( 1 ) OJ C 51, 17.2.2011, p. 55. ( 2 ) Position of the European Parliament of 7 July 2011 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and Decision of the Council of 19 July 2011. ",
        "their potential for physical, social, and mental well-being throughout the life course and to participate in society, while providing them with adequate protection, security and care when they need it. Accordingly, the promotion of active ageing requires a multi-dimensional approach and ownership by and lasting support among all generations. (10) The European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations (2012) should build on the legacy of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010) and the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship (2011) and, therefore, the synergies between those European Years and the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations (2012) (\u2018the European Year\u2019) should be promoted. (11) The growing proportion of older people in Europe and the increase in chronic health conditions makes it more important than ever to promote the healthy ageing of all, and in particular older people, supporting their vitality and dignity by, inter alia, ensuring access to appropriate and high-quality health care, long-term care and social services and developing initiatives promoting the prevention of health risks associated with ageing. Healthy ageing can help to raise the labour market participation of older people, enable them to be active in society for longer, improve their individual quality of life and limit pressure on health, social care and pension systems. (12) The Commission presented its views on the demographic challenges that the Union faces and on opportunities for tackling them in its communications \u2018The demographic future of Europe - from challenge to opportunity\u2019 of 12 October 2006, \u2018Promoting Solidarity between the Generations\u2019 of 10 May 2007 and \u2018Dealing with the impact of an ageing population in the EU (2009 Ageing Report)\u2019 of 29 April 2009. (13) The diversity of older generations in Europe will further increase. It is therefore necessary to actively promote equal opportunities and to encourage participation. Active citizens from different backgrounds have important bridge functions in society, foster integration and contribute to the economy. (14) The Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, adopted, on 22 February 2007, a Resolution on \u2018The opportunities and challenges of demographic change in Europe: the contribution of older people to economic and social development\u2019 which emphasised both the need to increase the possibilities for active participation by older people, including in the form of voluntary work, and the new economic opportunities (\u2018the silver economy\u2019) created by the growing demand on the part of older people for certain goods and services, as well as the importance of a positive public image of older people. (15) The Council adopted, on 8 June 2009, Conclusions on \u2018Equal opportunities for women and men: active and dignified ageing\u2019, which recognised that, throughout the Union, older women and men face serious challenges as they seek to live active lives and to age with dignity, and proposed a number of measures to Member States and the Commission, including the promotion of active ageing policies, taking into account the different situations in the various Member States and the different challenges faced by women and men. (16) The Council adopted, on 30 November 2009, Conclusions on \u2018Healthy and dignified ageing\u2019, inviting the Commission, inter alia, \u2018to develop awareness- raising activities to promote active ageing, including a possible European Year on Active Ageing and Intergener\u00ad ational Solidarity in 2012\u2019. (17) The Commission emphasised, in its Communication entitled \u2018Europe 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019 of 3 March 2010, the importance, to the Union, of promoting a healthy and actively-ageing population in the interests of social cohesion and higher productivity. On 23 November 2010, as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission adopted a flagship initiative entitled \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs: A European contribution towards full employment\u2019, under which Member States should notably promote active ageing policies. On 16 December 2010, the Commission also adopted a flagship initiative on a \u2018European Platform against Poverty and social exclusion: A European framework for social and territorial cohesion\u2019. Achieving those policy goals requires action from all levels of government and various non-govern\u00ad mental stakeholders; those goals can in turn be supported, at the level of the Union, by European Year activities that aim to raise awareness and to foster the exchange of good practice. National coordinators should see to it that national activities are coordinated and are consistent with the objectives of the European Year. The participation of other institutions and stakeholders should also be planned. (18) The Council adopted, on 7 June 2010, Conclusions on \u2018Active Ageing\u2019 inviting the Commission \u2018to pursue the preparation of a European Year for Active Ageing in 2012, during which the benefits of active ageing and its contribution to solidarity between generations can be highlighted and promising initiatives in support of active ageing at all levels can be publicised\u2019. (19) The European Parliament adopted, on 11 November 2010, a Resolution entitled \u2018Demographic challenge and solidarity between generations\u2019, calling on Member States EN L 246/6 Official Journal of the European Union 23.9.2011 ",
        "to make active ageing one of the priorities for the coming years. The resolution also stressed that the European Year should, in particular, highlight the contribution that older people make to society and afford opportunities to foster solidarity, cooperation and understanding between generations and to get younger and older people to work together. (20) Opinions drawn up by the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have also stressed the importance of active ageing for Europe by highlighting, inter alia, the value of cross- generational health care. (21) Council Decision 2010/707/EU of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States ( 1 ) calls, under Guidelines 7 and 8, on Member States to increase labour force participation through policies to promote active ageing, to raise employment rates of older workers through promoting innovation in the organisation of work and to increase the employa\u00ad bility of older workers through their up-skilling and participation in lifelong learning schemes. Guideline 10 emphasises the need to enhance social protection systems, lifelong learning and active inclusion policies with the aim of creating opportunities at different stages of people\u2019s lives, of shielding them from the risk of poverty and social exclusion and of enhancing their active participation in society. (22) In its Communication \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019, the first Europe 2020 flagship initiative, adopted on 19 May 2010, the Commission stressed the importance of information and communication technology (ICT) appli\u00ad cations and services for ageing well, proposing, in particular, the reinforcement of the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Joint Programme. The Digital Agenda for Europe also recommended taking concerted action to increase the digital competences of all Europeans, including older people, a group that is overrepresented within the 150 million citizens, or approximately 30 % of the total number of citizens, who have never used the internet. Facilitating access to, and providing training in the use of, new technologies would further improve the opportunities of older people. (23) In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission has proposed launching an Active and Healthy Ageing Innovation Partnership (AHAIP) within the framework of the \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 flagship initiative. The AHAIP would seek to enable citizens to live independently and in good health for longer and to increase by two the average number of healthy years of life by 2020. (24) The Commission is implementing the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, which, given the frequent correlation between disability and ageing, contains relevant actions for older people. In particular, actions on accessibility following \u2018Design for All\u2019 approaches are relevant. Actions to support independent living and inclusion in the community are also relevant, including those directed at older persons with disabilities who are in need of a high level of support, who have complex needs and who are particularly vulnerable and prone to social exclusion. Furthermore the Union and all Member States have signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which contains, inter alia, provisions that are relevant for older people. (25) The European Day of Intergenerational Solidarity is celebrated annually on 29 April. It provides a good opportunity for the Union to renew its commitment to strengthen solidarity and cooperation between generations in order to promote a fair and sustainable society. (26) This Decision establishes a financial envelope which is to constitute the prime reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 2 ). (27) Active ageing is also targeted by several Union funds, programmes and action plans, such as the European Social Fund ( 3 ), the European Regional Development Fund ( 4 ), the Progress programme ( 5 ), the Lifelong Learning Programme ( 6 ) and in particular its Grundtvig programme, the Health Programme ( 7 ), the specific programmes on ICTs and on socio-economic sciences and humanities in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development ( 8 ), the Action Plan on \u2018Ageing well in the information society\u2019, the AAL Joint EN 23.9.2011 Official Journal of the European Union L 246/7 ( 1 ) OJ L 308, 24.11.2010, p. 46.

(28) In order to ensure the participation of a diverse range of organisations, smaller scale events and operations should, as far as possible, be facilitated during the European Year. (29) Participation of relevant Union-level networks in the European Year should be encouraged and supported with adequate resources. (30) Since the objectives of the European Year cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States due to the need for transnational exchange of information and the Union-wide dissemination of good practice, and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Subject The year 2012 shall be designated as the \u2018European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations\u2019 (\u2018the European Year\u2019).

In doing so, it shall foster solidarity and cooperation between generations, taking into account diversity and gender equality. Promoting active ageing means creating better opportunities so that older women and men can play their part in the labour market, combating poverty, particularly that of women, and social exclusion, fostering volunteering and active participation in family life and society and encouraging healthy ageing in dignity. This involves, inter alia, adapting working conditions, combating negative age stereotypes and age discrimination, improving health and safety at work, adapting lifelong learning systems to the needs of an ageing workforce and ensuring that social protection systems are adequate and provide the right incentives. On the basis of the first paragraph, the objectives of the European Year shall be: (a) to raise general awareness of the value of active ageing and its various dimensions and to ensure that it is accorded a prominent position on the political agendas of stakeholders at all levels in order to highlight the useful contribution that older people make to society and the economy, raising the appreciation thereof, to promote active ageing, solidarity between generations and the vitality and the dignity of all people, and to do more to mobilise the potential of older people, regardless of their origin, and to enable them to lead an independent life; (b) to stimulate debate, to exchange information and to develop mutual learning between Member States and stakeholders at all levels in order to promote active ageing policies, to identify and disseminate good practice and to encourage cooperation and synergies; (c) to offer a framework for commitment and concrete action to enable the Union, Member States and stakeholders at all levels, with the involvement of civil society, the social partners and businesses and with particular emphasis on promoting information strategies, to develop innovative solutions, policies and long-term strategies, including comprehensive age-management strategies related to employment and work, through specific activities, and to pursue specific objectives related to active ageing and inter\u00ad generational solidarity; (d) to promote activities which will help to combat age discrimination, to overcome age-related stereotypes and to remove barriers, particularly with regard to employability.

The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 15 July 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for flufenoxuron. (7) During the evaluation of this active substance, concerns were identified. Those concerns were, in particular, the following. It was not possible to finalise the consumer risk assessment because consumer exposure could not be assessed reliably, in particular, with respect to magnitude and toxicological relevance of different metabolites. Furthermore, flufenoxuron has a high potential for bioac\u00ad cumulation in the food chain. In addition, a high risk to aquatic organisms was identified. (8) The Commission invited the applicant to submit its comments on the conclusion of the Authority. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 21(1) to Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 33/2008, the Commission invited the applicant to submit comments on the draft review report. The applicant submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined. (9) However, despite the arguments put forward by the applicant, the concerns referred to in recital 7 could not be eliminated. Consequently, it has not been demon\u00ad strated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing flufenoxuron satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC. (10) Flufenoxuron should therefore not be approved pursuant to Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. (11) For plant protection products containing flufenoxuron, where Member States grant any period of grace in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire on 31 December 2012 at the latest as laid down in the second paragraph of Article 3 of Decision 2008/934/EC. (12) This Regulation does not prejudice the submission of a further application for flufenoxuron pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. (13) In the interest of clarity, the entry for flufenoxuron in the Annex to Decision 2008/934/EC should be deleted. (14) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.

(6) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 614/2011 ( 6 ). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.
