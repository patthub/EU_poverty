        "1 Introduction The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was created in 2003/2004 and is now well established as the principal vehicle for cooperation with the neighbour countries. It is a collective EU response to the aspira- tions of its Eastern and Southern neighbours to jointly promote prosperity, stability and security in our region. The recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe. The political, economic, social and environmental gaps between the Union and its neighbours to the East \u2013 Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and the Southern Caucasus, and to the South, in the Mediterranean region, are worryingly large and in certain cases increasing. The EU wants to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours. The European Neighbourhood Policy represents a new approach in the EU\u2019s relations with its neighbours. This \u201cpartnership for reform\u201d is off ered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU 1 . It goes beyond classical co-operation: it consists of intensifi ed political dialogue and deeper economic relations, based on shared values and common interest in tackling common problems. The ENP is not about membership of the EU \u2013 if an accession perspective were to be off ered at some point in the future to any of the countries covered by the ENP, this would be a separate process. The necessary legal and institutional framework for intensifi ed cooperation with ENP partners are Part- nership and Cooperation Agreements or Association Agreements. The tools, however, to deliver concrete results are jointly agreed, tailor-made ENP Action Plans 2 with short and medium term priorities (3\u20135 years). They cover a wide range of issues: political dialogue and macro-economic reforms, trade, co-operation in Justice, Liberty and Security, various sector-policies (transport, energy, environment and climate change, research, information society, social policy and employment) as well as a deep human dimension \u2013 people to people contacts, education, health, civil society. The ENP Action Plans also provide a means of technical and fi nancial support in the partner\u2019s own reform eff orts and modernisation. The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), as a \u201cpolicy driven\u201d fi nancial instrument, will support in the period 2007\u20132013 the implementation of the ENP Action Plans, and, in the case of Russian Federation, which is not covered by the ENP 3 , the road-maps for the four common spaces. In that context, it goes further than promoting sustainable development and fi ghting poverty to encompass, for example, considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU\u2019s internal market. Legislative and regulatory convergence and institution building is supported through mechanisms such as the exchange of experience, long term twinning arrangements with Member States or participation in Community programmes and agencies. The ENPI replaces MEDA and TACIS and other existing geographical and thematic instruments. The Commission has set up a web-site explaining the ENP and its processes and containing key ENP docu- ments such as the Strategy Papers, the Action Plans and Progress Reports. Please refer to: http://ec.europa. eu/world/enp/index_en.htm. ENP partner countries are expected to benefi t considerably from full implementation of the ENP Action Plans, including from enhanced convergence with the EU approaches. For benefi ts resulting from enhanced environment protection, including convergence, please refer to Chapter 3. 1 Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine. 2 With exception of Algeria, Belarus, Libya and Syria ENP Action Plans have been agreed with all the countries mentioned 3 The EU and Russia are linked by the Strategic Partnership. 5 ",
        "In order to help partner countries to realise these benefi ts, the European Commission has decided to provide information on EU environment policy and legislation in key policy areas. To this end, the European Commission has initiated the production of six short guides on the following topics: \u2022 Water quality , with a focus on the Water Framework Directive and related developments, such as the Flood Directive or the Groundwater Directive; \u2022 Waste management , with a focus on the Waste Framework Directive; \u2022 Air quality , with a focus on the Framework and Daughter Directives; \u2022 Environmental Impact Assessment , Strategic Environmental Assessment, Access to Information, Participation in Decision-Making, and Reporting; \u2022 Nature protection , with a focus on the Habitats and Birds Directives (e.g. cross-border co-operation) and the Natura 2000 network (e.g. ways to establish measures or monitoring); \u2022 Industrial pollution , including the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive. Where relevant the guides address the seven Thematic Strategies under the 6 th Environment Action Programme (EAP). 4 The Thematic Strategies constitute the framework for action at EU level in each of the concerned priorities and cover the following fi elds: soil and the marine environment (in the priority area of biodiversity), air, pesticides and urban environment (in the priority area of environment, health and quality of life) and natural resources and waste recycling (in the priority area of natural resources and waste). 5 Climate change issues are becoming an increasingly important component of the EU\u2019s environmental cooperation with partner countries, which bilateral dialogues will increasingly address. Documents on this crucial topic of common interest will be issued separately from this series of guides. The purpose of this policy guide on waste is to provide information on EU policy and legislation by describing the policy background and explaining how progress can be achieved through the prioritisation and sequencing of activities. The guide shows how gradual or partial convergence with the EU environ- ment policy and legislation can assist the ENP partner countries and Russia in addressing environmental concerns. The policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU. This includes summarising the main provisions of the legislation. The guide also addresses the current general policy situation of Eastern and Mediterranean ENP partners and looks at potential challenges to convergence. Finally, it identifi es useful steps to be taken to promote convergence. Since the individual situation in partner countries varies considerably, the guides take a general approach and references to specifi c countries are not made. The relevance of full or partial convergence is also to be seen in this light. 4 For the 6 th EAP please refer to: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/newprg/index.htm. 5 For the seven Thematic Strategies please refer to: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/newprg/strategies_en.htm. 6 ",
        "2 In a Nutshell The problems that this policy aims to address: EU waste policy aims to foster environmentally sound waste management. The essential objective of all provisions relating to waste management should be the protection of human health and the environment against harmful eff ects caused by the collection, transport, treatment, storage and tipping of waste. 6 In addition to (uncontrolled) landfi lls and littering many countries face the challenge of continuously grow- ing waste amounts and/or changing composition of waste, e.g. increasing share of electronic waste as their economies grow. How the policy addresses these problems: Waste Management Hierarchy EU Waste Policy, more concretely the Waste Framework Directive, establishes a waste hierarchy by which it prioritises the management and treatment of waste along the following lines: \u2022 Prevention or reduction of waste production and its harmfulness; \u2022 Recovery of waste. The safe disposal of waste e.g. in landfi lls is only considered as a fi nal resort. By this hierarchy, the EU Waste Policy contributes to utilising the energetic or material resources embedded in waste and by this fosters the saving of primary resources (\u201cprimary energy\u201d, \u201cprimary materials\u201d). 7 Waste management planning In order to facilitate rational waste management, which takes into account the mass and composition of waste and the real needs of a community/region, the Waste Framework Directive prescribes waste manage- ment planning. Various specifi c directives regulate the management of specifi c waste streams and lay down a concrete objective for their recovery and recycling. These directives all stipulate the separate collection of these waste streams. Other waste management directives lay down requirements for the diff erent waste treatment methods, such as waste incineration and landfi lling, and lay down minimum standards for these treatment meth- ods. Expected benefi ts include: The benefi ts of the EU Waste law are manifold. It lays the framework for a waste management which mini- mises the risks for human health and the environment. 6 See for this also recital 2 of the Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (Waste Framework Directive). 7 See for this also recital 5 of the Waste Framework Directive. 7 ",
        "The compliance with the waste management hierarchy and sound waste planning contributes to the reduction or even abolition of uncontrolled landfi lls and littering in wilderness areas. This, in turn, reduces: \u2022 risks to human health; \u2022 air emissions; \u2022 polluted soils and groundwater; \u2022 dangerous substances from industrial or hazardous waste in the environment; \u2022 costs of restoring former waste disposal sites; \u2022 negative eff ects on biodiversity; \u2022 odours and breeding of rats. Furthermore, the directives on specifi c waste streams foster the use of secondary materials, such as plastics or metals, and thereby contribute to resource savings. The treatment-oriented directives raise environmen- tal standards and lower emission levels. Furthermore, a sophisticated waste management creates jobs in the administration (planning and control of waste management) and in the operative fi eld (waste collection and treatment). Some of these jobs are highly qualifi ed especially when compared to the simple \u201cdumping\u201d of waste in uncontrolled landfi lls. 8 ",
        "3 Expected Benefi ts of Convergence Convergence toward EU waste legislation may bring a number of benefi ts to ENP partners by contributing to more sustainable waste management (collection and treatment). The Waste Framework Directive sets the basic requirements for an environmentally friendly and sound waste management system. Convergence with this Directive could assist the ENP partners in establishing a functioning infrastructure for waste management. Waste management planning and a reliable system of waste collection and treatment can signifi cantly contribute to a waste management system that minimises the waste-related risks to human health and the environment. The Hazardous Waste Directive sets additional requirements for the management of hazardous wastes. Convergence with this Directive would alleviate the environmental and health-related pressures emanat- ing from the current disposal practices of hazardous waste in many ENP partner countries. This Directive also assigns waste authorities with the responsibility for planning hazardous waste management. The Waste Shipment Regulation implementing the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal sets specifi c requirements and restrictions for the ship- ment of waste in other countries, including countries that are not part of the EU. This serves to uphold the auto-suffi ciency of each country, especially for the treatment of waste destined for disposal, and protects countries from being overrun by waste originating from other countries. Convergence with the Waste Ship- ment Regulation and eff ective control of waste shipments would alleviate risks and burdens connected to (hazardous) waste imports for the ENP partners. In order to attain a certain environmental level of waste treatment, convergence of the ENP partner coun- tries with the basic waste treatment Directives, the Landfi ll Directive and the Waste Incineration Direc- tive is recommended. The Landfi ll Directive provides for a controlled disposal of waste on landfi lls featuring certain minimum requirements and contains stipulations for the after-care of landfi lls. Convergence with this Directive, therefore, would contribute to preventing the pollution of soil and groundwater and reduc- ing the frequency of polluted sites in the ENP partner countries. A well-managed disposal of waste in land- fi lls \u2013 instead of uncontrolled disposal \u2013 also lowers the risks of breeding vermin and odours. In addition to the basic waste treatment Directives, convergence with the Waste Incineration Directive would reduce and control emission levels of waste incineration plants. This helps to ensure that the diver- sion of waste from landfi lls to waste incineration does not result in additional health and environmental hazards as, for example, excessive emissions of dioxins and furans. Finally, convergence with the waste stream-based directives, like the Directive on Packaging Waste, the Directive of End of Life Vehicles or the Directive on Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment would increase the use of waste as a resource by way of recovery/recycling and may make some ENP partners less dependent on imports of primary raw materials, as metals, plastics, glass, paper, etc. This, however, would require the establishment of separate collection regimes managed by the producers of the respective goods or the state. Therefore, these three Directives constitute an advanced form of waste management. 9 ",
        "4 Overview of EU Waste Policy There is a large number of EU Directives and Regulations dealing with waste management. The most important directives will be described in the following sections. Most importantly, the European framework of waste legislation has evolved along the following three lines: \u2022 Basic rules for waste management in general (for all waste streams): Waste Framework Directive and Hazardous Waste Directive; Waste Shipment Regulation (see section 3.1 \u201cWaste management in general\u201d). \u2022 Rules for specifi c waste streams : Example directives include those related to packaging waste, end- of-life vehicles, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), waste from extractive industries (see section 3.2 \u201cDirectives on specifi c waste streams); \u2022 Rules for specifi c waste treatment modes : Example directives include those related to landfi lls and waste incineration (see section 3.3 Directive on specifi c waste treatment modes\u201d. The following sections will outline the basic stipulations of EU Waste law. 4.1 Basic Rules for Waste Management 4.1.1 Waste Framework Directive The Waste Framework Directive (WFD) 8 is the \u201cbasic law\u201d of EU Waste Policy. It dates from 1975 and was re-edited in 2006. The Directive is currently being amended and will be merged with the Hazardous Waste Directive and the Waste Oil Directive. 9 The Directive lays down the basic hierarchy of waste management and waste treatment and contains basic requirements for the waste treatment installations. The Waste Framework Directive applies to all waste streams (with the notable exception of nuclear waste and some other specifi c waste streams 10 ). It establishes the so-called waste hierarchy, sets out rules for waste management planning, qualifi ed waste collection and treatment and calls for obligatory permitting procedures for waste treatment plants. The WFD left the Member States two year to adhere to the requirements laid out by the Directive. 4.1.1.1 Waste hierarchy One of the basic schemes of the WFD is the so-called waste hierarchy (see Art. 3 WFD). The primary aim of European Waste policy is the prevention and reduction of waste production and its harmfulness . This could be achieved by employing clean technologies that conserve the use of natural resources, by an environmentally friendly product design and by appropriate techniques for the fi nal disposal of dangerous substances contained in waste destined for recovery. 8 Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste. 9 The proposal for an amendment to the WFD represents stipulations of the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, see COM(2005)666. 10 Like dead animal cadavers, waste water, blasting agent. 10 ",
        "The next-best option is \u2022 waste recovery , by means of recycling , re-use , reclamation or any other process with the goal of extracting secondary raw materials or \u2022 the use of waste as a source of energy (\u201cenergetic recovery\u201d) The WFD treats these two options as equally good, in contrast to some of the waste-stream-specifi c direc- tives, which prescribe a certain minimum rate of recycling. The last resort of waste management is the sound disposal of waste. Most importantly, this includes waste disposal in landfi lls but also \u2013 according to the current jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice 11 \u2013 the incineration of mixed household waste in waste incinerators. 12 A general requirement of the WFD is that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods that could harm the environment, Art. 4 WFD(1). The Member States shall, moreover, take the nec- essary measures to prohibit the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste, Art. 4 WFD(2). However, with regard to the waste hierarchy, the Waste Framework Directive sets up a waste treatment philosophy that does not foresee any mechanism to eff ectively prevent non-compliance. In turn, the waste- stream-specifi c directives described below set legally binding targets that the European Commission can enforce (via an infringement procedure) for the recovery and particularly recycling of waste. For mixed waste, a similar legally enforceable obligation does not exist. Member State practice: One policy example of the Member States in line with EU waste hierarchy is the Danish waste tax in the fi eld of construction waste, introduced in 1987. The disposal of waste in landfi lls is subject to the highest tax-level, followed by waste incineration without recovery of energy, followed by waste incin- eration recovering electricity, and waste incineration recovering electricity and thermal energy. The recycling of substances is not charged with the tax. A large number of EU Member States have introduced landfi ll taxes designed to divert waste from landfi lls to other more sophisticated waste management methods. Germany does not have a waste disposal tax. However, it features one of the strictest waste disposal laws in the European Union. Furthermore Germany has announced the political objective to abandon municipal waste disposal in landfi lls by the year 2020 (goal 2020). 4.1.1.2 Competent Waste Authorities Member States are required to establish or designate the competent authority or authorities responsible for implementing the Directive. Specifi ed tasks include drawing up waste management plans, issuing per- mits and inspecting installations (Art. 6 WFD). 4.1.1.3 Waste management Planning According to Art. 5(1) of the WFD the Member States have to make sure that an auto-suffi cient network of waste disposal facilities exists in the European Union that comply with the best available technologies and does not feature excessive costs. 11 See judgements of the European Court of Justice, 13. February 2003, C-228/00 and C-458/00. 12 This latter point is subject to a current amendment procedure of the WFD, which might have the eff ect that waste incinerators that are energetically eff ective and produce thermal and electric energy will be considered waste recovery plants (\u201cwaste-to-energy\u201d plants). 11 ",
        "The competent authorities of the Member States are required to develop one or more waste management plans (Art. 7 WFD) . Such plans shall describe in particular: \u2022 the type, quantity and origin of waste to be recovered or disposed of; \u2022 the general technical requirements; \u2022 any special arrangement for particular wastes; and \u2022 suitable disposal sites or installations. The plans may cover \u2022 the natural or legal persons empowered to manage waste; \u2022 estimated costs of recovery and disposal; \u2022 appropriate measures to encourage rationalisation of collection, sorting and treatment. The requirements on waste management planning under the WFD are complemented by more specifi c waste management planning requirements in the Hazardous Waste Directive and in the Packaging Direc- tive. The Waste Framework Directive is currently under review in the light of the Commission proposal (COM(2005)667) for a Directive on Waste that aims at setting recycling standards and obligating EU Member States to develop national waste prevention programmes. Member States practice: The Member States often develop national and regional/local waste management plans. 13 Whereas national waste management plans are often of strategic nature, regional/local plans are more action- oriented, featuring detailed descriptions of current and planned collection systems, treatment modes and facilities, etc. 14 4.1.1.4 Qualifi ed waste collection and treatment According to Art. 8 of the WFD, Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that any holder of waste: (a) has it handled by a private or public waste collector or by an undertaking which carries out the recov- ery or disposal operations; or (b) recovers or disposes of it himself in accordance with the requirements of this Directive. Member State practice: In general, most of the old EU Member States have a professional waste collection service, which is either run by the municipality (public waste management services) or by private companies commis- sioned with the waste collection services by the public waste authorities. National waste law often attributes a monopoly to these public waste collection services for the collection and treatment of particular waste fractions, particularly when it comes to the disposal of household waste. 4.1.1.5 Obligatory Permitting Procedure for Waste Treatment Plants The WFD lays down permitting requirements to be observed by the competent authorities for waste treatment plants (recovery and disposal plants; see detailed stipulations in Art. 9\u201312 WFD). In addition, establishments or undertakings carrying out waste treatment shall be subject to appropriate periodic inspections by the competent authorities (Art. 13 WFD). 13 See EU Guide \u201cPreparing a Waste Management Plan\u201d, p. 7, see http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/plans/pdf/wasteguide_fi nal.pdf (14 August 2007). 14 Ibidem. 12 ",
        "Sound public waste management and permitting requirements for waste treatment facilities limit the neg- ative environmental eff ects of waste management and increase public participation in the proceedings in local waste policy. 4.1.1.6 Polluter Pays Principle The cost of disposing of waste must be borne by the holder who has waste handled by a collector or disposer; and/or by the previous holder or the producer of the product from which the waste came. 4.1.2 Hazardous Waste Directive The Hazardous Waste Directive (HWD) lays down specifi c requirements for hazardous waste (i.e. specifi cally toxic, carcinogenic, etc. \u2013 waste normally originating from industry). It contains criteria for the elaboration of a hazardous waste list/waste catalogue, establishes a mixing ban and requires hazardous waste manage- ment planning. 15 4.1.2.1 Hazardous Waste List/Waste Catalogue The HWD does not include an enumeration of hazardous waste streams but empowers the European Com- mission to develop a hazardous waste list. The HWD provides abstract criteria for the completion of this list (see Annex III) and gives some indications as to which waste streams need to be considered when the Com- mission completes the list (Annex I and II). Furthermore, the HWD implies that this Commission-list might not be complete with all existing hazardous waste streams so that Member States are invited to add other wastes that display any of the properties (attributes) listed in Annex III to the Commission. 4.1.2.2 Identifi cation of hazardous waste discharge sites Member States shall take the necessary measures to require that on every site where tipping (discharge) of hazardous waste takes place the waste is recorded and identifi ed (Art. 2 (1) HWD) 4.1.2.3 Mixing ban Art. 2(2) of the HWD lays down a mixing ban for specifi c HW streams with other HW streams as well as with non-hazardous waste. Hence, the treatment of HW has, in principle, to be tailored for the respective HW streams. Most importantly, HW may not be mixed with the intention to dilute the hazardous properties of the waste and thus to re-defi ne the respective waste stream. A permit for the mixing of waste can only be granted in exceptional circumstances, providing that the mixing is environmentally sound (see Art 4 of the WFD, see above) and especially fulfi ls the purpose of improving safety during disposal or recovery. 4.1.2.4 Hazardous Waste Management Planning The Member States have to create waste management plans for hazardous wastes , laying down the methods for the treatment of HW. These hazardous waste management plans can be merged with the waste management plans for non-hazardous waste (according to Art. 5 of the WFD). 4.1.3 Waste Shipment Regulation The Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) sets limits to the shipment of waste within and out of the area of the European Union [Transfrontier Shipment of Waste (TFS)] for environmental reasons. The WSR implements the Basel Convention and OECD-Council decisions in the EU. 15 The Member States had over three years to adapt their legislation to the HWD. 13 ",
        "The original Waste Shipment Regulation 16 was fundamentally amended in 2006 17 , the new stipulations will take eff ect from 01 August 2007 and will be referred to in the following paragraphs. 18 The controls on Transfrontier Shipments of Waste (TFS) aim to ensure a high level of protection for the envi- ronment and for human health. They also aim to prevent the unauthorised disposal of international waste shipments and the unregulated recovery of hazardous wastes, without hindering the legitimate trade of waste. This guide cannot describe all the provisions of the WSR in detail but concentrates on the fundamental principles. The WSR foresees two waste shipment control procedures: \u2022 the procedure for prior written notifi cation and consent: the procedure applicable to all shipments of waste intended for disposal and hazardous and semi-hazardous waste intended for recovery (see for the latter \u201cAmber List\u201d in Annex IV and IV A of the WSR and Art. 3 (1)(b) of the WSR) ; \u2022 the procedure in which shipments are accompanied by certain information, applicable to non-haz- ardous waste intended for recovery (see \u201cGreen List\u201d Annex III, IIIA and IIIB of the WSR) . The basic rule is that the trans-boundary shipment of all waste destined for disposal must be notifi ed to and then authorised by the competent authorities, i.e. by the authorities of dispatch, destination and where appropriate transit (see the detailed stipulations of Art. 4ff WSR). The authorisation can be refused based on the reasons for objections to waste shipments laid out in Art. 11. One of these reasons is that the planned shipment or disposal would not be in accordance with measures taken to implement the principles of prox- imity, priority for recovery and self-suffi ciency at Community and national levels in accordance with the Waste Framework Directive. This reason constitutes a very \u201cgeneral\u201d reason to oppose shipment of waste for disposal based on which virtually every shipment of waste destined for disposal can be refused. Mixed municipal waste (household waste, etc.) generally follows the rules of waste to be disposed of (Art. 3 para 5 WSR), giving authorities the power to refuse the trans-boundary shipment of mixed household waste. The export of waste destined for disposal out of EU territory is forbidden (exception: EFTA states which are also parties to the Basel Convention under certain circumstances), see Art. 34 WSR. Waste listed in the \u201cAmber List\u201d and destined for recovery principally follows the rules of waste for dis- posal . The reasons for objections against the shipment of this kind of waste are, however, enlisted in Art. 12. The trans-boundary shipment of waste listed in the green list and destined for recovery need not be notifi ed to nor authorised by the authorities. Only a few administrative information requirements apply (see in detail Art. 18). The export of waste destined for recovery out of EU territory is subject to a multitude of restrictions, the description of which is beyond the scope of this study (see Art. 36ff WSR). 4.2 Rules for specifi c waste streams (\u201crecycling/recovery directives\u201d) Even though the Waste Framework Directive establishes a basic waste hierarchy, there are no legally bind- ing and enforceable obligations to recover mixed solid waste in the Waste Framework Directive, nor in the Hazardous Waste Directive, as the hierarchy signifi es only a political \u201ctarget\u201d and is not enforced through binding recycling/recovery rates. 16 Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community. 17 REGULATION (EC)No 1013/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL, of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste. 18 The original Waste Shipment Regulation had to be applied by the Member States 15 months after its publication. 14 ",
        "By contrast, a number of directives regarding specifi c waste streams have been enacted at the European level in recent years. These directives concern the following waste streams: \u2022 packaging waste; \u2022 end-of-life vehicles; \u2022 batteries; \u2022 electric and electronic waste; \u2022 waste from extractive industries. All of these Directives refl ect the waste management hierarchy designed by the Waste Framework Direc- tive by giving priority to the prevention/reduction of the specifi c waste and as a second-best option the recycling or recovery. Another common feature of the directives cited above is that the waste streams addressed by these directives are supposed to be treated separately and that specifi c recycling and recovery targets are prescribed. Recycling signifi es reprocessing in a production process of the waste materials for the origi- nal purpose or for other purposes including organic recycling but excluding energy recovery. Recovery is a broader term than recycling that includes all operations listed in Annex II B of the Waste Framework Directive, i.a. energy recovery (e.g. waste incineration using waste as a fuel) and recycling. In contrast to the Waste Framework Directive, the waste-specifi c directives do not treat recycling and energetic recovery as equal but lay down a minimum target for recycling , thus regarding it the more \u201cvaluable\u201d way of using the materials as a resource. With the help of these specifi c requirements, the disposal of the mentioned waste streams in landfi lls is very much limited by the directives. 4.2.1 Directive on Packaging Waste The specifi c waste stream of packaging waste is subject to the Directive on Packaging Waste (PWD) 19 . SCOPE: Packaging waste comprises waste of all products made of materials of any nature to be used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery and presentation of goods, from raw materials to processed goods, from producer to the user or the consumer. Art. 3 of the PWD contains a more detailed defi nition of the sort of packaging waste covered by the PWD. REDUCTION: Member States shall fi rst of all ensure that packaging waste is reduced (e.g. by limiting the packaging of consumer goods). RECOVERY AND RECYCLING OBJECTIVES: As a further measure Member States have to enhance the reuse and recovery/recycling of the packaging waste (Art. 5\u20137 PWD) and have to comply with the recovery/ recycling quota mentioned below. Member States may encourage reuse systems of such packaging that can be reused in an environmentally sound manner (Art. 5 PWD) Member States shall, furthermore, take the necessary measures to ensure that systems are set up to provide for a) the returns and/or collection of used packaging from the consumer, other fi nal user, or from the waste stream in order to channel it to the most appropriate waste management alternatives; b) the reuse or recovery including recycling of the packaging and/or packaging waste collected, in order to meet the objectives laid down in this Directive. These systems shall be open to the participa- tion of the economic operators of the sectors concerned and to the participation of the competent public authorities. (see Art. 7) 19 European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste, Offi cial Journal L. 365, 31/12/1994, p. 0010-0023. 15 ",
        "The recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste are as follows: Treatment mode Parameter Quota 2001\u20132008 Quota from 31 December 2008 Recovery Overall 50% (min)\u201365% (max) 60% (min) Recycling Overall 25% (min)\u201345% (max) 55% (min)\u201380% (max) Recycling Glass 15% (min) 60% (min) Recycling Paper 15% (min) 60% (min) Recycling Metals 15% (min) 50% (min) Recycling Plastics 15% (min) 22,5% (min) Recycling Wood 15% (min) 15% (min) Member States Practice Germany and Austria have passed Packaging Waste Ordinances and have established privately run and privately fi nanced packaging recycling organisations. The costs for the recovery/recycling of the packaging waste are included in the price for the respective consumer good, which is labelled \u201cGr\u00fcner Punkt\u201d (Green Point). The recovery rate of packaging waste amounted to 78,4% and the recycling rate to 69,9% in 2004. 20 This means that between the date of introduction of a legal framework stipulating the separate collection and reuse/recovery/recycling of packaging waste in 1991 and 2004 the recycling/recovery rate doubled from 39,2 to 78,4%. 21 In order to promote recycling of waste packaging and to prevent the littering of the countryside with beverage cans and other beverage packaging, Germany levies a deposit on all beverage cans and not environmentally friendly beverage packaging (e.g. plastic bottles) to be refunded after the cans have been handed in to recycling points (in supermarkets, etc.). Since this deposit was introduced, the waste stream of beverage cans has all but disappeared in Germany. 22 In the UK , businesses have a choice of how to comply with the requirements of the PWD. They can either do everything themselves and purchase evidence of compliance to show they have met their obligations; or they can join a registered compliance scheme. A scheme takes on the legal recycling obligations for a business and carries them out for it. There are currently 21 compliance schemes. 23 According to information by DEFRA, the U.K. system has been successful in increasing the levels of packaging waste recovered and recycled from 30% in 1997 to 55.6% by 2004. 24 In real terms, the total amount of packaging waste recovered and recycled in 1998 was 3.3 million tonnes; in 2004, it was almost 5.65 million tonnes therefore over 2.3 million tonnes of additional packaging waste was diverted from landfi ll in 2004 compared with 1998. According to information by the European Commission, in 2004 the EU-25 average rate of packaging recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery was 65,6%, and the aver- age recycling rate was 53,9%. The following average recycling rates were achieved for the diff erent packaging materials: glass: 58%, paper and board: 70,4%, metals: 57% and plastics: 24,6%. 25 All old Member States have set up return, collection and recovery systems for packaging waste. Most have adopted measures aiming to encourage the use of recyclable material. 20 http://www.env-it.de/umweltdaten/public/theme.do?nodeIdent=2315 (27 February 2007). 21 http://www.bmu.de/abfallwirtschaft/doc/37498.php (9 March 2007). 22 http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1146473999709.shtml (9 March 2007). 23 http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/waste/topics/packaging/faq.htm (27 February 2007). 24 http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/packaging/pdf/packagewaste06.pdf, p. 18 (1 November 2007). 25 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/packaging/data.htm (24 August 2007). 16 ",
        "4.2.2 Directive on End-of-life vehicles Collection and treatment of end-of-life vehicles is subject to the Directive on End-of-life vehicles (ELV Directive). SCOPE: The ELV Directive deals with \u201cwaste cars\u201d, which are defi ned in Article 2 No. 1 and 2 (cars of M1 and N1 category). WASTE REDUCTION: The ELV Directive 26 in Art. 4 appeals to the economic actors to reduce ELV waste by using resource-eff ective materials, eliminating hazardous substances from cars and incorporating increas- ing amounts of recyclates in vehicle design. Apart from this, the ELV Directive also contains the bans of certain materials used in the construction of cars or for spare parts. These bans will not be described in this guide. RECYCLING AND RECOVERY TARGETS : The End-of-life-vehicle-Directive (ELV D) lays down requirements for the collection and treatment of end-of-life vehicles. The two basic innovations of the ELV Directive are: \u2022 Cost-free take back system for ELV to be run by producers and other economic actors (as from 1 January 2007 for all cars); \u2022 Recycling and recovery targets for ELV treatment. Art. 5 of the ELV Directive obliges the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure \u2022 that economic operators set up systems for the collection of all end-of life vehicles and, as far as technically feasible, of waste used parts removed when passenger cars are repaired, \u2022 the adequate availability of collection facilities within their territory. All ELVs shall be transferred to authorised treatment facilities. An ELV may be de-registered only upon submission of a certifi cate of destruction as a token that the car has been handed over to an authorised treatment facility and is managed (stripped, depolluted, shredded and treated) in accordance with the requirements of the ELV Directive. Member States that do not have a de-registration system must otherwise ensure that the authorities are notifi ed about the ELV reaching a treatment facility. The treatment facility has to comply with the minimum treatment requirements laid down in Article 6 and Annex I of the ELV D. As from 1 January 2006 for all end-of-life vehicles, the reuse and recovery shall amount to a minimum of 85% by an average weight per vehicle and year. Within the same time limit the reuse and recycling shall be increased to a minimum of 80% by an average per vehicle and year. These targets increase to 95% and 85% respectively by 1 January 2015. PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY: The principle of the producer responsibility is the core mechanism intro- duced in the Directive. Although the Directive is addressed to Member States, it is the producers or third parties acting on their behalf that are responsible for collection, treatment, recovery and environmental disposal. 4.2.3 Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment The Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE Directive) is the most recent of the stream-based waste directives. SCOPE: The electrical and electronic equipment is defi ned as equipment dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fi elds in order to work properly and equipment for the generation, transfer and measure- ment of such currents and fi elds falling under the categories set out in Annex IA and designed for use with a voltage below 1000V AC and 1500V DC. 26 Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end of life vehicles, Offi cial Journal L 269, 21.20.2000, p. 34. 17 ",
        "WASTE REDUCTION: The Directive on Waste electrical and electronic equipment 27 (hereinafter WEEE Directive) prescribes in Art. 4 that Member States shall encourage the design and production of electrical and electronic equipment which take into account and facilitate dismantling and recovery, in particular the reuse and recycling of WEEE, their components and materials. SEPARATE COLLECTION, RECYCLING AND RECOVERY TARGETS: Member States shall adopt appropri- ate measures in order to minimise the disposal of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and achieve a high level of separate collection of WEEE. The Directive requires Member State to create systems allowing fi nal holders and distributors to return WEEE free of charge. The WEEE Directive prescribes four kilograms on average per inhabitant per year of WEEE from private households as a minimum rate of separate collec- tion (Art. 5 No. 5 WEEE). This mandatory target shall be revised in 2008. The treatment shall at a minimum include the removal of all fl uids. The Directive fi xes also specifi c recycling and recovery targets, which vary among the specifi c categories of equipment. Electronic waste stream Recycling Recovery Large Household Appliances 75% 80% Automatic Dispensers IT and telecommunications equipment 65% 75% Consumer equipment Small household appliances 50% 70% Lighting equipment Tools Toys, leisure and sports equipment Monitoring and control instruments Gas discharge lamps 80% \u2013 TREATMENT To guarantee environmentally sound treatment of the separately collected WEEE, the WEEE Directive lays down treatment requirements in Annex II for specifi c materials and components of WEEE and Annex III lays down requirements for the treatment and storage sites. PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY: The principle of producer responsibility is the core mechanism introduced in the Directive. Whereas the Directive is addressed to Member States, it is the producers or third parties acting on their behalf that are responsible for collection, treatment, recovery and environmental disposal. They have a responsibility for the fi nancing, the labelling, the organisation, the collection and providing of information. 4.2.4 Directive on the management of waste from extractive industries The Directive on the management of waste from extractive industry is a very recent directive passed in 2006. It aims at preventing or minimising environmental and human health eff ects both from the day-to- day operation of extractive waste facilities as well as accidents. SCOPE: The Directive on the management of waste from extractive industries applies to waste resulting from the extraction, treatment and storage of mineral resources and the working of quarries. Waste covered by this Directive no longer falls within the scope of Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfi ll of waste. REDUCTION/RECYCLING/RECOVERY: Member States must ensure that waste facility operators draw up a waste management plan to be reviewed every fi ve years. The objectives of the plan must be as follows: \u2022 to prevent or reduce the generation of waste and its negative impact; \u2022 to encourage waste recovery through recycling, re-use or reclaiming; \u2022 to encourage the short and long-term safe disposal of waste. 27 Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equip- ment (WEEE). 18 ",
        "The waste management plan must include at least the following: \u2022 a description of the waste and its classifi cation, a description of the substances used to process the mineral resources, the method of disposal and the system used for waste transport; \u2022 a description of the operation generating this waste; \u2022 the control and monitoring procedures; \u2022 where applicable, the classifi cation of the waste facility; \u2022 the closure plan and the after-closure procedures; \u2022 measures for the prevention of water and soil pollution; \u2022 a survey of the condition of the land to be aff ected by the waste facility. CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF EXTRACTIVE WASTE FACILITIES: Waste from extractive industries must be managed in specialised facilities in accordance with specifi c rules laid down in the Directive. When a new waste facility is built or an existing one modifi ed, the competent authority must satisfy itself that: \u2022 the facility is suitably located; \u2022 its physical stability is ensured and soil and water pollution are prevented; \u2022 it is monitored and inspected by competent persons; \u2022 arrangements are made for the closure of the facility, the rehabilitation of the land and the after- closure phase. The Directive provides for classifi cation of the high-risk facilities as 'Category A' subject to requirements specifi c to a major-accident prevention policy. This predetermines their mode of operation and the security measures to be taken in compliance with the Directive (not outlined in this study). The competent authority must satisfy that waste facility operators have taken the measures necessary to prevent water and soil contamination, in particular by: \u2022 evaluating leachate generation 28 ; \u2022 preventing leachate generation and preventing surface water or groundwater from being contami- nated by the waste; \u2022 treating contaminated water and leachate in order to ensure their discharge. When placing extractive waste back into the excavation voids for rehabilitation and construction purposes, operators must take appropriate measures to secure the stability of the waste, monitor it and prevent soil and water pollution. INSPECTIONS, RECORDS AND REPORTS: The competent authority must inspect waste facilities at regu- lar intervals, including after their closure. Operators are required to keep up-to-date records of all waste management operations and to make them available for inspection by the competent authority. Member States must ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities, including abandoned waste facili- ties, located in their territory is drawn up and periodically updated. This inventory should include facilities that currently have serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential of becoming a serious threat to human health or the environment in the short or medium term. 28 Leachate means any liquid percolating through the deposited waste, including polluted drainage. 19 ",
        "4.3 Rules for specifi c waste treatment modes The Directives on specifi c waste treatment modes lay down minimum requirements for the sound treat- ment of certain types of waste. 4.3.1 Landfi ll Directive The Landfi ll Directive intends to promote compliance with the waste hierarchy in that it bans certain waste streams from being put to landfi lls. In this sense it limits the options for waste disposal on landfi lls . Most importantly, Member States have to formulate strategies on how to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfi lls . Art. 5(2) sets the following targets: Biodegradable municipal waste going to landfi lls must be reduced to a certain proportion of the total amount (by weight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 or the latest year before 1995 for which standardised Eurostat data is available: \u2022 to 75% by 16 July 2006; \u2022 to 50% by 16 July 2009; \u2022 to 35% by 16 July 2016. Member States that put more than 80% of their collected municipal waste to landfi ll in 1995 (or the latest year before 1995 to which standardised EUROSTAT data is available) may postpone the attainment of the targets by a period not exceeding four years. One of the main purposes and benefi ts of the reduction of biodegradable waste from landfi ll is to reduce the methane emissions, an important cause of the greenhouse eff ect and far more harmful to the climate than CO 2 . The Landfi ll Directive, moreover, bans a series of specifi c waste streams from landfi lls (see Art. 5(3). In Art. 6 lit. a.) the Landfi ll Directive stipulates that only waste that has been subject to treatment may be landfi lled (except for inert waste). The treatment should reduce the quantity of the waste or the hazards to human health and the environment. The Landfi ll Directive lays down legal standards for landfi lls. If these requirements are not fulfi lled, the landfi lls have to be shut down. The Landfi ll Directive establishes three categories of landfi lls that need to comply with diff erent requirements: \u2022 Landfi lls for inert waste (category 0) \u2022 Landfi ll for non-hazardous waste (category I and II) \u2022 Landfi ll for hazardous waste (category III and IV). Detailed criteria for the acceptance of waste in the various landfi ll categories are laid down in Council Deci- sion 2003/33. The Directive, furthermore, contains requirements for the licensing, maintenance, the closure and the after- care of the landfi lls. As a consequence, landfi lls that do not feature the basic requirements (e.g. a fi rm baseline that prevents residual water of the landfi ll from polluting ground water) must be closed and after-care requirements must be fulfi lled. 20 ",
        "4.3.2 Waste Incineration Directive The objective of the Waste Incineration Directive (WI-D) is to prevent or to limit as far as practicable nega- tive eff ects on the environment, in particular pollution by emissions into air, soil, surface water and ground- water due to waste incineration. SCOPE: The Waste Incineration Directive lays down emission limit values for installations that incinerate or co-incinerate waste. PERMIT REQUIREMENT: WI-D stipulates that no incineration or co-incineration plant shall operate with- out a permit to carry out these activities. The application for a permit shall include a description of the measures that should guarantee that: \u2022 the plant is designed, equipped and will be operated in such a manner that the requirements of this Directive will consider the categories of waste to be incinerated; \u2022 the heat generated during the incineration and co-incineration process is recovered as far as practica- ble, e.g. through combined heat and power, the generation of process steam or district heating; \u2022 the residues will be minimised in quantity and harmfulness and recycled where appropriate; \u2022 the disposal of the residues which cannot be prevented, reduced or recycled will be carried out in conformity with national and Community legislation. The Directive lists further requirements for the permits to be issued (e.g. compliance with measurement standards as laid down in Annex III, concrete outlook which quantity of waste streams may be incinerated, etc.). OPERATING CONDITIONS OF THE WASTE INCINERATION PLANT: The incineration plant shall be oper- ated in order to achieve a level of incineration such that the slag and bottom ashes Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content is less than 3% or their loss on ignition is less than 5% of the dry weight of the material. Moreover, the Directive stipulates requirements for the incineration process (minimum temperature for hazardous and non-hazardous waste, gas treatment, etc.). The Directive lays down minimum emission limit values for exhaust and wastewater for waste incinera- tors and co-incineration plants. These requirements have to be checked against the requirements of the IPPC Directive, which stipulates that a large number of types of waste incineration plants and co-incinera- tion plants need to be permitted according to the Best Available Techniques (BAT). 21 ",

        "5 Current situation with respect to Policy Sector The following section describes the current situation with respect to waste management of the ENP partners. 5.1 EU\u2019s Eastern ENP partners and Russia The waste sector in most European neighbouring countries and Russia has been subject to a transforma- tion process. In the ENP Action Plans of these countries, the adoption of legislation and planning for waste management as a key environmental concern are one of the primary objectives (see ENP Action Plans for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine). The following environmental pressures are common: \u2022 No widespread reduction or recovery policy for waste; \u2022 Uncontrolled waste dumping; \u2022 No sound treatment of hazardous waste; \u2022 Problems with illegal transboundary movement of waste; \u2022 Illegal imports of hazardous waste. 5.2 EU\u2019s Mediterranean Partners As far as the Mediterranean Partners are concerned, waste management plays a role in most of the existing ENP Action Plans, including the ones in Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Tunisia. Principally, the Mediterranean Partners face similar challenges as the East-European Neighbouring Countries and Russia to which can be added: \u2022 Frequent absence of sound waste management services; \u2022 Existence of an \u201cInformal\u201d recycling sector 29 . 29 This implies informal \u201cworkers\u201d who search waste bins for valuable materials and sell these materials to intermediates or small companies, which \u201crecover\u201d these materials. The activities of these informal \u201cworkers\u201d, who often operate secretly on ground that is not theirs, is often not approved by the state and private households, nor does it comply with hygienic standards. 23 ",
        "6 Implementation Considerations for ENP Partners and Russia EU funding for ENP From the beginning of the new Financial Framework 2007\u20132013, the EU is providing fi nancial support for the ENP through a dedicated European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) . It targets various areas of co-operation including sustainable development and the environment, supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the ENP Action Plans. The ENPI will target sustainable development and convergence with EU policies and legislation, and bring a radical improvement in capacity to support cross-border cooperation along the EU\u2019s external borders \u2013 thus giving substance to the aim of avoiding the creation of new dividing lines and promoting harmonious territorial development across the EU external border. The ENPI replaces MEDA (for the Southern Mediterranean neighbours) and TACIS (for the Eastern neighbours and the Russian Federation). Guided by the agreed priorities in the ENP Action Plans, the ENPI provides for assistance under nation- al, regional, cross-border and interregional programmes. There are also a certain number of thematic programmes with global scope from which the ENPI countries can benefi t. This includes a thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy. The ENPI budget is fi xed at around \u20ac 12 billion for the period 2007\u20132013. In real terms it means as increase of 32% as compared with the previous fi nancial framework. As a means of delivering technical assistance under the ENP, the Technical Assistance and Informa- tion Exchange (TAIEX) instrument and long-term twinning arrangements have been made avail- able to the ENP partner countries: \u2022 TAIEX provides technical support and training in areas related to the implementation of the ENP Action Plans, including with regard to the convergence, application and enforcement of legislation. It is largely demand driven and channels requests for assistance and contributes to the delivery of appropriate tailor-made expertise to address problems at short notice 30 . \u2022 Twinning aims to help benefi ciary countries in the development of modern and effi cient adminis- trations. It can also facilitate gradual convergence to EU legislation where relevant and appropriate. Depending on the status quo (\u201cstarting point\u201d) of each country, a step-by-step approach could be suitable to improve the environmental quality of waste management. 6.1 Waste Management as a Matter of Public Interest 6.1.1 Designation of Waste Authorities and Waste Management Planning The fi rst basic step for a state to deal with waste management in an environmentally sound manner is to declare waste management a matter of public interest regardless of whether waste management is ulti- mately carried out by the state or private company. 30 http://taiex.ec.europa.eu/ 24 ",
        "Many ENP partner countries are in the process of administrative restructuring and in those countries public waste authorities have to be designated that are clearly responsible for developing a system of waste man- agement that minimises negative impacts to the environment and human health. Waste authorities then have to develop a waste policy consisting of basic strategic choices and technical day-to-day management of the waste streams in the state. In order to prepare and control the proper management of waste, these authorities have to acquire an overview of the quantities and qualities of the wastes produced in the states and have to devise options for waste collections and treatment. To gain such an overview, waste management planning has to be employed. The plan would include an overview of waste fl ows and existing \u201coffi cial\u201d waste treatment sites. Such a \u201cstatus-quo\u201d plan would be the basis for the development and/or improvement of a waste policy, includ- ing strategic choices such as the future method of waste collection/treatment of waste. Depending on the status quo of the countries, the waste authorities would need to identify priority areas of action addressing the most urgent waste-related problems. Chapters 6.2\u20136.5 give an overview of the most common problems and how they could be addressed with help of drawing on the EU waste legislation. 6.1.2 Installation of a waste collection service and fi nes against littering One of the basic reasons for insuffi cient waste management resulting in waste in the streets (\u201clittering\u201d) are: \u2022 Absence of an eff ective waste collection service; \u2022 High prices for waste collection; \u2022 Lack of awareness of a proper environment. Waste in the street was identifi ed as a waste related problem in many ENP partners which causes serious hygienic problems, including the creation of an environment conducive to infestation by rats and other vermin, odour and the risk of contamination of soil and groundwater. For these reasons, the reduction of littering must be a priority for those countries where garbage on the street is widespread. In order to transform the present situation of uncontrolled waste disposal into a publicly managed waste scheme, the blueprint of the Waste Framework Directive , in connection with requirements of the Landfi ll Directive/Waste Incineration Directive, could be helpful in guiding the authorities. A fundamental requirement for ecologically sound and socially acceptable waste management is the pro- fessional collection and treatment of waste produced in a local community to be organised by the public authorities. 31 In turn, any \u201cinformal\u201d waste recycling, e.g. extraction of valuable goods from landfi lls or public/private waste bins by non-authorised persons should be suppressed. The exclusive assignment of waste man- agement activities to competent public waste management services or private waste management fi rms should guarantee that waste is collected in a professional manner. In addition, all waste treatment, includ- ing recycling, should be carried out in installations that have been permitted to ensure compliance with legally established environmental and health standards. In order to combat littering from negligence of the population, littering could be categorised as a mis- demeanour and subject to fi nes, of course requiring the political will and the resources to collect the fi nes. 31 The actual operative collection can be carried out either by public services or private fi rms commissioned by the waste authori- ties. 25 ",
        "6.2 From uncontrolled landfi lls to controlled landfi lls 6.2.1 Landfi lls in the waste management plans The existence of uncontrolled landfi lls has been identifi ed as a core problem for most of the Eastern Euro- pean and Mediterranean neighbours as well as Russia. In order to improve this situation, waste authorities would fi rst need to inventory existing uncontrolled landfi lls, categorising them according to their potential impact to the environment. The waste authorities then would need to push for the gradual closure of the uncontrolled landfi lls with a high risk to human health and the environment. Over a transition period and to taking account of economic realities in the respective states, inert waste could be put on these landfi lls preparing their closure. The introduction of a legal obligation like a permit for all legally operated landfi lls and the imposition of certain minimum environmental requirements via these permits could signifi cantly reduce negative en- vironmental pressures and would lead \u2013 after an adequate transition period, which will be indispensable for economic reasons \u2013 to the closure of many uncontrolled landfi ll sites. The requirements of the Landfi ll Directive and the Decision on Waste Acceptance Criteria could serve as guidelines for a landfi ll manage- ment plan. In the long run, uncontrolled landfi lls need to be replaced by landfi lls complying with basic environmental requirements such as leachate collection, bottom sealing, gas collection and hazard control, leading to a restriction of landfi ll sites and a reduction of uncontrolled emissions. This shift would require a substantial investment into infrastructure, as well as trained personnel to inspect the landfi ll sites and to ensure com- pliance of these landfi lls with all standards. This all contributes to a sharp rise of the costs of landfi lling. 6.2.2 Landfi lls for hazardous waste A highly urgent measure is also the closure of wild disposal sites for hazardous (\u201cindustrial\u201d) wastes that have a far higher polluting potential for soil and groundwater than non-hazardous waste. As these wild disposal sites for hazardous wastes are common in many Eastern and Mediterranean states, the transfer of the hazardous waste from wild sites to offi cial (permitted) landfi lls would be a high priority. It is, moreover, of paramount importance to ban hazardous wastes from standard household waste land- fi lls and construct landfi lls exclusively for hazardous waste. The requirements of the Landfi ll Directive , which stipulates diff erent Landfi ll Classes including Class III for hazardous waste, can serve as a guideline for the construction and operation of such hazardous waste landfi lls. Furthermore, the development of hazardous waste management plans as stipulated in the Hazardous Waste Directive , which could be part of general waste management plan, is recommended. 6.3 Exclusion of certain waste streams from \u201clegal\u201d landfi lls Even if the Eastern and Mediterranean neighbours and Russia want to continue to use waste disposal in landfi lls as their major waste disposal practice, another highly important step would be to exclude certain waste streams from landfi lls. The exclusion of certain waste streams from landfi ll can concern waste streams that are \u2022 suitable for recycling or energetic recovery and/or \u2022 responsible for the lion\u2019s share of greenhouse gas emissions from landfi lls, such as organic waste. One condition for the diversion of certain waste streams from landfi lls to other treatment modes is a priori separate collection of these waste streams or the ex-post extraction of the waste streams from the mixed waste. With the level of technology progressing, such ex-post sorting technology might soon be available and the introduction of elaborate separate collection schemes might be dispensable. 26 ",
        "This would, however, require the political will to invest in high-level recycling technology and to accept higher waste fees as sophisticated waste management concepts, including a high rate of recycling, are in most cases more costly than simple landfi lling. It is of primary importance that the products of any recycling and recovery processes can be marketed and thus can contribute to a lowering of waste management costs. Therefore, policy makers should promote secondary product and energy from waste-to-energy installations to assure that they can be sold and used. Thus, public campaigns and public procurement should raise awareness of waste as a resource. 6.3.1 Promotion of recovery and recycling of certain waste streams Even if the operation of offi cially permitted landfi ll is preferable to unregulated waste dumping, waste disposal in landfi lls is still considered the least environmentally sound way of waste \u201ctreatment\u201d. Resources contained in the diff erent waste streams are lost by \u201cburying\u201d them in landfi lls, often becoming polluted sites after their closure. Thus, the recycling and recovery of waste is largely preferable to waste disposal in landfi lls, as established in the Waste Hierarchy of the Waste Framework Directive (see Art. 3 WFD). The promotion of waste recycling and energy recovery serves the following aims: \u2022 Use of waste as a resource and production of secondary materials and energy; \u2022 Limitation of territories needed as landfi ll and reduction of polluted sites. A secondary eff ect of extensive recycling and recovery is also the creation of jobs, as even offi cial landfi lls require fewer employers than recycling or waste-to-energy installations. Elements of the waste-stream directives dealing with packaging waste, end-of-life vehicles or electronic waste can serve as guidelines as to which waste streams might be diverted from landfi lls to recycling and recovery plants. 6.3.2 Ban of organic waste from landfi lls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Organic waste landfi lled is responsible for methane emissions from landfi lls that are very harmful to the climate. Thus, in the interest of climate protection, biowaste, waste wood, sewage sludge should be banned from landfi lls and diverted to suitable treatment plants, such as fermentation or composting. 6.4 Promote controls of waste shipments in accordance with the Basel Convention An eff ective control of waste shipment by the authorities of the exporting and the importing countries is indispensable to achieve a reduction of the masses of hazardous waste shipped illegally to other countries. Such a reduction of waste imports also alleviates the pressure for the authorities of the countries import- ing waste to fi nd a proper way to deal with these waste streams. Instead, the exporting countries need to devise strategies to treat their own waste in a proper way. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Dis- posal 32 , to which virtually all of the ENP are parties, constitutes the framework to reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and other wastes to a minimum consistent with their environmentally sound management. 32 This Convention was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the 116 States participating in the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Global Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes. 27 ",
        "An eff ective implementation of the requirements of the Basel Convention by the ENP would very much help limit the undesired imports of hazardous and other wastes into the Eastern and Mediterranean Partners as well as Russia. The European Waste Shipment Regulation could serve as a blueprint for a sound national or trans-national legislation implementing the Basel Convention and laying down the exact procedures and conditions to be complied with when hazardous and other waste is shipped from one state to another. 6.5 Flexible Instruments to achieve the diversion of waste streams from landfi lls to other treatments A variety of instruments exist to achieve a reduction of waste disposed in landfi lls. Basically, landfi lls are considered to be the lowest level of waste disposal. However, the diversion of waste to other treatment methods as waste incineration can also create environmental or health related problems when the waste treatment installations are not equipped with sound technology for emission abatement (for example the emission of dioxins) and not managed in an expert manner. One option is command and control measures that have, for example, been employed by Denmark (ban of combustible waste in landfi lls), Germany (ban of waste wood and waste featuring a TOC > 5%) or Austria (ban of waste featuring a TOC > 3%). These options prohibit the landfi lling of specifi c waste streams. These options are predominantly taken for waste with a high organic content and thus responsible for green- house gas emissions. Also, the Landfi ll Directive obliges Member States to reduce waste in landfi lls that feature a high organic content. Another possibility is to employ economic incentives that reduce the economic attractiveness of waste disposal in landfi lls and increase the appeal of recycling. One example is the landfi ll tax, currently imposed only on national level without any EU-related obligations. The landfi ll tax is intended to reduce the overall masses of waste destined for landfi lls via price mechanisms. Another option, which can be described as a mixture between command-and-control and economic incen- tives, are producer responsibility measures (such as the Packaging Waste Directive, the ELV Directive or the WEEE Directive). These measures oblige the producers, importers and retailers to achieve certain collec- tion and reuse/recycling/recovery targets for specifi c waste streams. Still, these measures do not prohibit completely the disposal of certain parts of these waste streams in landfi lls, but stipulate legally binding minimum rates of recovery and recycling of these waste streams. The producers, retailers and importers of the diff erent goods are free in their choice of instruments to achieve this aim. 6.6 Legislative Considerations and Mechanisms in the Context of Implementation ENP Partners and Russia could considerably benefi t from the adoption of some of the principles outlined in the European Waste Law. To this end, there is often a need for ENP to develop or renew: \u2022 national waste management policy and waste management plans; \u2022 waste framework legislation; \u2022 sustainable waste management systems; \u2022 waste classifi cation and inventory systems. In order to guarantee that the newly developed/renewed policies and concepts are also put into practice, it is of primary importance that control and implementation mechanisms work well. For this, the following instruments need to be in place: \u2022 control mechanisms; \u2022 physical infrastructure; \u2022 institutional capacity, public participation and access to information; \u2022 awareness-raising and training; 28 ",
        "\u2022 economic instruments and fi nancing tools, management of trans-boundary movement of wastes and eff ective mechanisms for international co-operation and convergence in relation to EU waste legisla- tion. Apart from these aspects (indispensable for a sustainable waste management system), further challenges to convergence lie in the costs that an advanced waste management system triggers. Not only are addi- tional administrative and operational personnel needed to guarantee a solid waste management service, but advanced technology has to be applied as well. 6.7 Cost Estimations with regard to Implementation Solid waste treatment of residual waste can increase costs for citizens. Exact costs and prices cannot be given in this guide; however, some estimations can be given. The price for waste disposal in landfi lls that are properly operated and comply with the Landfi ll Directive and are not subject to a landfi ll tax are rated on average at 75\u2013150 Euro/ton in Germany. 33 The costs for operating landfi lls not complying with these standards are of course much lower, as will be the case in most of the landfi lls in the countries covered in this guide. If the residual waste is pre-treated in Mechanical-Biological Treatment Plants (MBT), prices (Germany) range between 50 and 90 Euros 34 for the treatment, plus the costs for the landfi lling of the waste that remains after the treatment (normally fermentation or composting, about 30% of the input). The highly calorifi c waste separated in MBT (about 20\u201330% of the input) can be co-incinerated in an industrial plant (cement mill, power station). This treatment has to be paid for by the waste manager at about 25\u201340 Euro/ton. Thus, the sum of costs for the treatment for 1 ton of waste can be estimated at 80\u2013140 Euro. The thermal treatment of residual waste in a waste incineration installation that complies with the Waste Incineration Directive can be priced between 100 and 140 Euro/ton on average. 35 6.8 Lessons learned Many elements of the EU waste legislation are apt to improve the waste management situation in the Eastern and Mediterranean Neighbouring Countries and Russia. It is obvious that it is neither realistic nor necessary to apply all EU waste legislation at once in the region of Eastern and Mediterranean Countries and Russia. As the region is not homogenous, a step-by-step approach according to concrete \u201cstarting points\u201d with regard to waste management within these countries could turn out to be most useful. Those countries that do not yet feature a dependable public waste management system should start off with implementing the basic requirements of a sound general waste management planning and the enforcement of these plans. Those countries already featuring a well-working public/private waste management service and exclusive- ly \u201clegal\u201d landfi lls could tighten the environmental standards of landfi lling, introduce recycling/recovery targets and benefi t from the EU-experience with diff erent waste streams. 33 See Nassour/Legler, Integration von vorhandenen Anlagen zur Restabfallbehandlung ab dem Jahr 2005, in M\u00fcll und Abfall 2003, p. 223. 34 Ibidem. 35 See the value of 130 Euro, which the EU-project HOLIWAST assumed for waste incineration: http://www.lca-net.com/holiwast/542jhw/1/costs_operators/ . 29 ",
